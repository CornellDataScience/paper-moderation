Abstract:
We propose a new architecture, the Transformer, for sequence transduction tasks.  // Unlike the recurrent and convolutional models that are typically used, the Transformer relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.  // The Transformer has several advantages, including the ability to be parallelized and faster training times.  // Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on translation tasks and offers a simpler architecture than existing models.

 // Introduction:
The Transformer model introduced in this paper is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional sequence-to-sequence models, which rely on recurrent neural networks (RNNs).  // RNNs are notoriously difficult to train, especially for long sequences, and require a significant amount of time to process sequential data.  // Our approach uses a self-attention mechanism to process sequences in parallel, allowing for more efficient computation.

 // Related Work:
Sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation, have traditionally been tackled with RNN-based architectures.  // In particular, models like the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) have been widely used.  // Attention mechanisms, such as those in Bahdanau et al. ( // 2014), have also been explored to improve the performance of RNNs.  // However, these models still suffer from the inherent limitations of sequential processing.  // Our model, the Transformer, addresses these issues by using only attention mechanisms.

 // Model Architecture:
The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure.  // Both the encoder and decoder are made up of several layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks.  // The encoder takes in the input sequence and produces a set of context-sensitive representations.  // The decoder generates the output sequence based on these representations, attending to both the encoder outputs and the previous tokens in the output sequence.

 // Self-Attention:
Self-attention is a mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of each token in the input sequence relative to the others.  // This is done by calculating attention scores for each token pair, which are then used to produce a weighted sum of the input tokens.  // The key insight behind self-attention is that each word in a sentence can have a relationship with every other word, and this relationship can be learned and used to generate more accurate predictions.

 // Multi-Head Attention:
Multi-head attention allows the model to attend to different parts of the sequence in parallel.  // Instead of computing a single attention score for each pair of tokens, the model computes multiple attention scores using different learned projections of the input sequence.  // This enables the model to capture different types of relationships between tokens.

 // Feed-Forward Networks:
Each layer of the encoder and decoder includes a feed-forward network, which consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.  // These networks help the model to capture complex patterns and interactions between the input tokens.

 // Positional Encoding:
Since the Transformer does not rely on sequential processing like RNNs, it needs a way to incorporate the order of tokens in the input sequence.  // We achieve this through the use of positional encoding, which adds a fixed, learned representation of the position of each token in the sequence to the input embeddings.

 // Training:
The Transformer is trained using standard techniques, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation.  // We use the Adam optimizer with learning rate decay and employ dropout for regularization.

 // Experiments:
We evaluate the Transformer model on several machine translation tasks, including the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation benchmarks.  // The Transformer outperforms previous models, including both RNN-based models and models with attention mechanisms.

 // Results:
On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the Transformer achieves a BLEU score of 28.4, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art models by a significant margin.  // On the English-to-French task, the Transformer achieves a BLEU score of 41.8, surpassing all existing models.

 // Conclusion:
The Transformer model represents a significant step forward in the field of sequence transduction.  // By relying entirely on attention mechanisms, it overcomes the limitations of RNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results on machine translation tasks.  // The model is also more efficient to train, allowing for faster development of deep learning models for sequence tasks.
