Abstract —Rabies is so serious, affecting the health of each 
citizen of Camarines Norte due to the careless nature of most 
people and the lack of immediate treatment for dog bites in 
many. This study will focus on the spread of rabies in Camarines 
Norte using mathematical modeli ng and simulation to predict 
rabies transmission and to determine the target number of dogs 
to vaccinate. This simulation of data based on records of the 
number of persons bitten or vaccinated against rabies in the 
Animal Bite Center at Camarines Norte is to estimate the trends 
in the monthly number of cases of bites and to estimate the rise 
of the cases with time. Protocols for the treatment for rabies are 
prepared and enhanced in the hospitals to get a better response 
and a prevention strategy that reduce s fatality rates caused by 
the rabies virus. Results of the simulation also provide monthly 
predictions of increases in the cases of bites, giving the health 
facilities an insight into periods of increased risk and thus 
preparing them well for such periods .

I. INTRODUCTION  
Rabies is an acute viral infectious disease of human and other 
vertebrates belonging to the group of  mammals, the etiology 
of which is the rabies virus of the Rhabdoviridae family and 
the Lyssavirus genus. It is acquired from the saliva of infected 
animals, mostly  through a bite  or an attack  (Hanan Farihah 
et al., 2022) .  Globally , rabies is estimated to kill  59,000 
human every year , with 99% of the victims having been bitten 
by dogs (Pongsumpun, 2022) .  
The first time that dog rabies was noted in the Philippines was 
in 1910 , when a human case had been documented  and Negri 
bodies seen in the cerebral tissue  of the biting dog. A case 
analysis of human rabies reports in the Philippines from 1987 
to 2006 reveals that a higher prevalence of rabies is associated 
with contact with animals with rabies, specifically dogs. 
According to the review, there is a strong call  for continued  
awareness and control measures in preventing rabies 
transmission in the country (Dimaano et al., 2011) . 
To offer post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to bite patients, the 
Philippine government has set up fifteen Animal Bite 
Treatment Centers (ABTCs) in different regions throughout 
the island country. Yet the frequency of bite patient 
presentations has escalated, exponentially and rabidities  in 
domestic dogs is still on the rise.  Weak surveillance worsens the problem, resulting in low caseload identification and slower response to outbreaks (Rysava et al., 2022) . 
The contact patterns in this model were therefore influenced by the environment or density and interaction rates of the dogs (Nurdiansyah et al., 2024) . Rabies prevalence and 
incidence studies across the geographical context shows  that 
rabies may differ due  to regional characteristics, thus may 
require customized  vaccination and intervention programmes 
across specific groups of the population (Renald, 2020) . 
In the study titled “Sensitivity Analysis and Numerical 
Simulations for the Mathematical Model of Rabies in Human 
and Animal within and around Addis Ababa”, the researchers 
found that factors such as the annual dog birth rate and the 
natural death rate of dogs are critical in influencing rabies 
transmission dynamics (Ega et al., 2015) . 
Rabies attacks rise by 100 percent in three provinces of Bicol 
region from January 1 to March 9 this year as per DOH- Bicol 
Region report on March 21, 2014 as sourced by Manila 
Bulletin. This rise underlines the major  health risks 
associated with  rabies in rural provinces including Camarines 
Norte  (Rabies Cases in 3 Bicol Provinces up 100%, Says 
DOH , n.d.) . Previous and post -intervention assessment of a 
study conducted in Bicol proved that raising awareness before and after project implementation improves rates of 
mass rabies vaccinations and other preventive 
measures (Barroga et al., 2018).  
Available information indicates  that the best approach of 
controlling human rabies is through  mass vaccination of the 
animals especially  dogs (Britton, 2020) . Analyses  from 
another model indicated  that a vaccination approach  may cut 
down  rabies occurrences, especially among stray 
dogs (Verma & Kunwar, 2024)  
Several studies have pointed out that due to rabies altering the 
behaviour of affected dogs, the disease has a longer survival 
rate in dogs. Another  study used a network -based model in an 
attempt to explain  how behavior modification  in infected 
dogs contributes to the  transmission  of rabies; the study 
posited  that over 70% vaccination rate may be required to 
stem the disease  (Brookes et al., 2019) . Programs of 
vaccination and public health measures  have been proved  to 
reduce considerably  incidence of rabies in domestic and wild 
animals , which translates directly to human health(Morters et 
al., 2013) .  Simulation model on the other hand  refers to the use of 
mathematical model to mimic the functioning of a process or 
a system at different  time intervals. Various mass dog 
vaccination strategies are most conveniently analyzed with 
simulation model to estimate  the public cost -effectiveness , 
and the  information gained from the simulation outcomes can 
be useful for the animal health authorities to make the 
decisions on rabies  control in the  areas  like Flores Island  
(Wera et al., 2017).  
 Various studies have adopted mathematical models to 
analyze rabies dynamics and the impact of control strategies. 
The study titled “ Mathematical Models for Rabies  focused on 
the rabies virus and its associated host –pathogen population 
dynamics, using this remarkable model system to develop mathematical models of infectious disease emergence and 
spread. Their work signifies a progression from simple 
susceptible -infectious -removed (SIR) compartment models 
of fox rabies emergence and spread across Western Euro pe to 
more complex models incorporating dynamics across 
heterogeneous landscapes, host demographic variation, and 
environmental stochasticity  (Panjeti & Real, 2011) .  
 
In the present mathematical modeling of rabies, vaccination 
and culling have been incorporated in order to study the 
efficacy of the general preventive measures to control the 
disease(Hailemichael et al., 2022) .  Optimal control studies 
have established that effective vaccination with knowledge of rabies transmission dynamics can contribute to significant reduction of rabies incidence and towards the vision of no 
human rabies fatalities from dog bites by 2030(Hampson et 
al., 2020) . 
 
In    this    preliminary     paper,  we     propose     an 
unprecedented   SEIRS   rabies   model   for  the  spread   of  ra
bies in Camarines Norte   in hopes to expound the ongoing 
rabies situation.   We simulate the   model  with  the  observed 
number of infected human cases in Camarines Norte from 
January   2009  to  December   2023.   We 
then  analyze  the  influence   of  initial  
conditions   and  parameter   values   on  the  number   of  infec
ted humans.  
II. M
ATERIALS AND METHOD  
In order to investigate the dog -human transmission dynamics 
of rabies in Daet, Camarines Norte, this paper adopted the 
compartmental SEIRS model proposed by  
 
where each human and dog population is divided into four 
categories based on their case status. They include; (i) the Susceptible (S) category they are the person who is prone to 
rabies; (ii) the Exposed (E) category they include people who 
have come into contact with the rabies but have not developed 
the rabies, there is the incubation or latency period; (iii) the 
Infected (I) people in this category are those who are actively transmitting the rabies, they are infected and can infect 
others; and lastly, (iv) the Removed (R) category consists of individuals who are no longer part of the transmission cycle, either because they have developed immunity or have 
succumbed to the rabies.  A. Model Formulation

B. Disease Equilibria and Basic Reproduction Number  
 Assuming there is no rabies infection and by setting the 
right-hand side of equation (1) to zero, we find the equilibrium 
point where the disease is absent:  
 
such that   
 
  
and  
 
 
 
Therefore, the basic reproduction number is defined to be  
 
 
 
If rabies is present in both populations and we set the right -
hand side of equation (1) to zero, we reach the endemic 
equilibrium point.  
 
such that  
 
  
 
 and   
  
C. Parameter Estimation  
Parameterization proved to be difficult due to a limited 
data source, as Camarines Norte Provincial Hospital had no 
available census in the public in this current year. Therefore, 
the values of parameters in Table I and Table II are mainly 
from estimations made based on reported values and from assumptions taken from literature searches, respectively. Therefore, the values of parameters in Table I and Table II are mainly from estima tions made based on reported values and 
from assumptions taken from literature searches, respectively.          
The total number of dogs in Camarines Norte is estimated 
to be in 2023, according to the provincial veterinarian. We 
assume the crude annual dog birth rate per 1000 population of 
dogs to be 300, which is in the range published in the paper titled “Populati on Dynamics of Owned, Free -Roaming Dogs: 
Implications for Rabies Control”(Conan et al., 2015) . We then 
manipulate the value to estimate the monthly number of newborn puppies (A). A total of 17824 dogs have been vaccinated from January 2023 to December 2023, according to the provincial veterinarian, and the value is used to estimate the dog vaccination rate (k). The provincial veterinarian stated that a total of 1470 dogs have been disposed of from January 2023 to December 2023. We then calculated the average number of dogs disposed of and found that an approximate 0.04% of dogs were removed from Ja nuary to December in 
2023. We then calculated the average number of dogs disposed of and found that an approximate 0.04 of dogs were 
removed from January to December in 2023. The estimation 
of the dog vaccination immunity loss rate is based on the assumpti on that dogs lose immunity after one year. Due to 
limited information on dog demographics in Camarines Norte, some parameters are derived from published estimates in (Zhang et al., 2011)and converted to monthly units as needed. For instance, the mean dog incubation period (1/σ), natural death rate of dogs (m), risk of clinical outcome for exposed dogs (y), and dog disease -related death rate (μ) are assumed to 
be 2.5 months, 0.08 years, 0.4 years, and 1 year, respectively (Zhang et al., 2011) . 
Cases of positive human rabies were provided by 
Camarines Norte Provincial Hospital. Each case is reported with details that include monthly data of the number of animal 
bites and exposure, category of exposure, immunization 
status, and the Total Cohort Re port, which summarizes the 
total figures for the quarter of the associated dog- bite incident. 
The crude birth rate available from the Philippines Statistics Authority Region V -Bicol Region ( Vital Statistics | Philippine 
Statistics Authority V - Bicol, n.d.) and the crude death rate per 
1,000 population in Camarines Norte given by the Provincial Hospital are used to approximate the number of monthly human births (B) and the natural human mortality rate (m
1), 
respectively.   
Out of the total 6988 cases of positive human rabies in 
2023 in Camarines Norte, there was 1 fatality, resulting in 6987 survivors. Consequently, the death rate (μ1) now stands at approximately 0.014 over the span of 12 months, from January 2023 to December 2023. All victims were 
CamNortenios, including who were bitten and died in 
Camarines Norte. We extracted data on the biting incidents and subsequent onset of clinical symptoms reported by each of the 6988 cases in 2023. By calculating the duration of tim e 
between exposure and becoming symptomatic, we estimate the mean human incubation period (1/σ1) to be 2.5 months.  
According to an experimental study titled “Survival of 
naturally infected rabid dogs and cats (Tepsumethanon et al., 
2004) , around half of the total 1820 dogs with bite case history 
will turn rabid. Therefore, we estimate the human vaccination rate (k
1) by taking the proportion of the average number of humans vaccinated per month and the total number of exposed humans in which the frequency of bite cases is taken as a proxy. All the data required for the estimation is obtained from the provincial hospital.  
Lastly, the transmission rates of rabies among dogs (β) and 
that of dogs to humans (β
1) are obtained from data fitting. 
Actual data on the number of infected humans dated January 2023 until December 2023 used for our model fitting are 
mostly obtained from Provincial Hospital. The infected 
humans, by our definition, are those victims who are  showing 
clinical signs of rabies. All parameters listed in Table I and Table II are non -negative with units of month.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
The compartmental SEIRS model is a mathematical 
model of description of the spread of infectious diseases. 
Finally, the analysis shows that SEIRS model is an effective approach to modeling and controlling dog rabies. It helps one 
understand ways in which t he disease can spread, ways in 
which vaccination campaign can be conducted and how one 
can effectively control the disease. This model previously 
applied to estimate the patterns of rabies transmission in dog 
populations and the impact of infection, recovery, and vaccination.  
By using the values of parameters in Table I and 
Table II, we simulate the SEIRS model by solving the system and employing deSolve function ode in R.) We aim at 
reproducing the number of infected human rabies cases in 
Camarines Norte from January 2009 to December 2023 data from the Provincial Hospital of Camarines Norte. In 2023, the 
total number of dogs in Camarines Norte is approximately 
34627 and the crude birth rate of dogs per 1000 population is taken as 300, thus we assume (0) = 150000. According to t he 
Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index , the 
population size in Camarines Norte  in 2023 is estimated to be 
609,226  (Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index , 
n.d.), so we take S
1 (0) = 609,226  . We let l1(0) = 6,988 as 
cases of human infected with rabies based on the data in 
January to December 2023  were reported in 2023. Other 
initial conditions are chosen through fitting.  
The requested solution at time t is the number of 
infected human rabies , labeled as I(t) in the figure is 
displayed as a continuous  line as shown in Fig. 2. This curve 
illustrates  the trend of human infected cases  whereby the 
numbers of infected humans rose to approximately 400 in 
month 1 to about  1000 cases in  month 12.  This is quite 
reasonable given the rather random nature of human rabies cases and the fitting between our simulated model and the 
observed monthly number of infected humans in Fig 2 is 
rather good.  We further iterated the model to the extent 
where results were static and this is highlighted in Fig 3.  
 
 Fig 2. The solid curve in  represents the  number of human 
infected cases  over a 12 -month period starting January 2023 
to December 2023  
 
 
 
Fig 3 . Simulated number of infected human rabies cases over the course of 6 years starting June 2023 to February 2028 
 
From the model simulation in Fig. 3, it emerges that 
the first four years, and the number of infected cases is static 
and almost negligible. From the fifth year, the cases increase 
sharply, and this trend continues up to the end of the sixth 
year. This high rise infers that there could have been a 
compromise of the control measures or there were enhanced predisposing factors explaining rabies spread. Therefore, 
using increases in the number of cases and deaths, we predict 
the basic reproduction number (R0) of the virus is more than 1 (R0 > 1). This means that each infected person can infect 
more than one other person this may lead to an outbreak if 
not contained.  
We then perform sensitivity analysis on some of the 
model parameters by simulating the model for 60 months 
while varying the parameter values. Our finding demonstrates that the dog vaccination rate k has an influence 
on the number of infected human rabies cases as shown in 
Fig. 4.  The fact  that we proved that different rates of dog 
vaccination (k) fundamentally shift  the number of human 
rabies cases over time. Figure 4 also shows that higher 
percentage of people vaccinated (e.g., (k=0.9)) reduces the number  of human infection while lower percentage (e.g., 
(k=0.5)) increases the number of human infection. This therefore justifies the importance of dog vaccination against 
rabies so as to prevent spread to human populations.

k=0.5We also observe the influence of the monthly 
number of newborn puppies on the number of infected human 
rabies cases. Fig. 5 shows how different numbers of newborn 
puppies (A=866, A=500, A=200, A=50) affect the number of 
human rabies infections over time.  It proves that when there 
are only 50 newborn puppies monthly, cases of rabies in 
humans are few. But when the number of newborn puppies is 
increases  to 200, 500 and 866, the number of human rabies 
cases are seen to rapidly escalate. This shows that the cas es 
are even lower when the number of newborn puppies gets 
low. Additionally, as observed in Fig. 6 all culling rates result 
to reduction in human infected cases. Nevertheless, as time 
increases, the higher e culling rates especially e=2, lead to 
higher hum an infections after declining during the same 
period. Thus, it implies that peoples rate in turn hints that 
although eradication is effective in cutting out cases in the 
short run, a higher rate of the virus means more strains and 
cases in the long haul. A lso, it can be clearly illustrated from 
Fig. 7 that, human vaccination rate has great impact on the 
number of human infected cases. This figure implies that as the k values increase meaning more of the population has 
been vaccinated the rate at which the cases of infection 
increase is also fast.  
Hence, management of dog birth  is another 
important in dealing with rabies because it reduces the flow 
of fresh susceptible dogs in circulation. Results presented 
here show that rabies control is not straightforward and 
should best be dealt with within an integrated manner and in 
conjunction with animal control and human vaccination approaches.

IV. C
ONCLUSION  
Regardless of working through cases of human rabies in 
Camarines Norte, we need to align with the actual data on the 
number of human infected with rabies in Camarines Norte 
from January 2009 to December 2023 by a compartmental SEIRS model. In short our early investigations the dynamics 
of rabies transmission a re intricately linked to the population 
of newborn puppies culling rates and human vaccination rates. The data clearly indicates that a lower number of newborn 
puppies significantly reduces the incidence of human rabies cases. While culling can initially d ecrease the number of 
infections excessively high culling rates may paradoxically lead to a resurgence of cases over time. Moreover the impact of human vaccination is profound, with higher vaccination rates correlating with a rapid increase in the number o f 
infected cases  
Our findings focus on  several critical factors in controlling 
rabies spread. Firstly reducing the birth rate of puppies place a significant role in lowering the number of susceptible animals which in turn decreases human rabies cases over time The results  suggest that controlling the input of new 
unvaccinated puppies is essential to managing overall infection rates.  
Secondly, while culling can minimize infection rates 
initially high culling rates may lead to unintended increases in 
infections in the long term. This outcome focus on the need 
for cautious application of culling, possibly supplemented by 
other measures, to avoid potential resurgence. Thirdly dog 
vaccination rates are a key factor in minimizing rabies spread. 
Our model showed that higher vaccination coverage among 
dogs significantly reduces human rabies cases. Therefore 
sustained vaccination campaigns targ eting at least 70%, of the 
dog population should be prioritized as an effective intervention. Last human vaccination particularly post 
exposure prophylaxis remains vital in preventing infection 
after potential rabies exposure Higher human vaccination rates especially in areas with high dog populations contributes 
to controlling rabies spread.
