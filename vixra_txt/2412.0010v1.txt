Abstract
These are some notes on category theory that might be useful to a
first year graduate student in mathematics. This is the first of a three
part series including references to literature, on the theme of identity,
examples of objects defined using the universal property and a section on
monomorphisms and epimorphisms.

2 Identity
LetCbe a category and X∈ObjC. By definition[6], Xhas an identity mor-
phism 1X∈MorC(X ,X). A morphism f:X→YinCis called an isomorphism
if there exists another morphism g:Y→Xsuch that f◦g=IdYandg◦f=IdX.

1D. An isomorphism in this category is called an isomorphism of functors.
There is a notion similar to isomorphism of categories called "equivalence of
categories". Let F:C→Dbe a functor. The categories CandDare equivalent
if there exists a functor G:D→Csuch that F(G(D)) =D′andG(F(C)) =C′
where DandD′are same upto isomorphism and similarly for CandC′for all
objects C∈ObjCandD∈ObjD. This can also be written as F◦G= 1Dand
G◦F∈ 1C.
3 Examples of an object that are defined using a
Universal Property
3.1 Product
LetCbe a category in which objects called products exist(to be defined now).
LetE 1 ,E 2∈ObjC. A product of E 1 ,E 2is the triple P ,π 1 ,π 2such that P(short
for the triple) is unique upto unique isomorphism. That is to say, it satisfies
a universal property. More precisely, it is a final object in some suitable cate-
gory. The maps in the triple are called projection maps. They are named so in
analogy with the familiar products and their projection maps to the constituent
objects. If P′is an object in the category of sets along with two maps, which are
the projection maps to E 1andE 2, then there is a map from Pto the product
defined above. Exchanging Pand the product defined above there is a map
from E 1×E 2toP. This is depicted in the following commutative diagram:
E 1
P′P
E 2∃ !π′
1
π′
2π 1
π 2
For example, the triple consisting of the cartesian product of two sets and
the projection maps is a product, so products exist in the category of sets Set.
These two maps are inverses of each other and the isomorphism between
them is unique. This is the universal property of the product in the category
of magmas. A product object exists in a category if such conditions are true
in that category. In fact this construction exists in the category of sets as well.
(y ,x)is an example of a different product P. There is an obvious isomorphism
between PtoE 1×E 2such that (y ,x)7→(x ,y).
23.2 Extension
LetCbe a category in which objects called Extensions exist(to be defined now)
in which monomorphisms are injective and epimorphisms are surjectives. Let
thecategoryhavezeroobjectsaswell. Objectshavepropertiesofatleastgroups.
LetG ,F∈ObjCsuch that F G. The triple E= (E ,i ,π)is an
extensionof GbyFifthereexistsanobject Ewhichsatisfiesauniversalproperty

The following proposition shows that the category of groups has extensions.
Proposition 1. In the category of groups, let E ,E∞be two extensions of G
byF. Ifu:E→E 1be a morphism then uis an isomorphism.
Proof.F E G
E 1i
i 1π
uπ 1 Letu(x) =e 1. So π(x) =π 1◦u(x) =π 1(e 1) =
eG. Thus x∈Ker π =Im i. So, x=i(x′).i 1(x′) =u◦i(x′) =u(x) =e 1=⇒
x′=efsince i 1is injective. Thus x=e. So, Ker uis trivial and thus uis
injective.
π=π◦uis surjective and πis surjective so uis surjective.
A map s:G→Eis called a section of the extension if π◦s=IdG. A map
r:E→Fis called a retraction of the extension if r◦i=IdF. For example, direct
products in the category of groups. In the category of groups, if Eis isomorphic
toF×Gthen it is called a trivial extension. Following are some equivalent ways
of saying that Eis a trivial extension of GbyF.
Theorem 2. Eextension of GbyF.[1] TFAE
1.Eis a trivial extension.
2.Ehas a retraction r.
3.Ehas a section ssuch that s(G)is contained in the centralizer of i(F).

y 1= (e ,x 1)andy= (x ,e)and thus y 1y=yy 1.s(G)commutes with every
element of i(F), since F×Gis isomorphic to E.
(ii implies i)
(r ,π) :E→F×Gis a morphism of extensions so it is an isomorphism by the
above proposition and thus Eis a trivial extension.
(iii implies i)
(i ,s) :F×G→Eis a morphism of extensions so it is an isomorphism.
4 Monomorphisms and Epimorphisms
Definition 3 (Monomorphism) .An monomorphism in a category Cis a
morphism f:U→Vthat satisfies left cancellation: for any Cand any
morphisms g ,h:W⇒U, whenever f◦g=f◦h, then g=h.
Proposition 4. Composition of monomorphisms are monomorphisms.
Proof. h 1 ,h 2:U⇒Vmorphisms.
f:V→W,g:W→Xmonomorphisms.
If(g◦f)◦h 1= (g◦f)◦h 2then using associativity, g◦(f◦h 1) =g◦(f◦h 2)=⇒
f◦h 1=f◦h 2=⇒h 1=h 2. So, composition of monomorphisms is a
monomorphism.
Proposition 5. In the category of sets and groups, a monomorphism and
injective map are same.
Proof.Letf:V→Wbe an injective map in the category of sets(groups).
Leth 1 ,h 2:U⇒Vbe set(group) morphisms such that f◦h 1=f◦h 2. So,
f(h 1(x)) =f(h 2)(x)=⇒h 1(x) =h 2(x)for all x∈U. So, h 1=h 2and thus f
is a monomorphism.
4Letf:V→Wbe a monomorphism in the category of sets(groups). Let
h 1 ,h 2:U⇒Vbe set(group) morphisms. Let Ube a singleton set consisting
of the element u. Let h 1(u) =xandh 2(u) =y. Let f(x) =f(y), sof(h 1(u)) =
f(h 2(u))and thus f◦h 1=f◦h 2since it f◦h 1(u) =f◦h 2(u)for all elements
u∈U. Since fis a monomorphism, h 1=h 2and thus x=y. So, fis an
injective map in the category of sets and groups.
Definition 6 (Epimorphism) .An epimorphism in a category Cis a mor-
phism f:A→Bthat satisfies right cancellation: for any Cand any mor-
phisms g ,h:B⇒C, whenever g◦f=h◦f, then g=h.
Proposition 7. Composition of epimorphisms are epimorphisms.
Proposition 8. In the category of sets and groups, a epimorphism and
surjective map are same.
The result will be proved only in the category of sets. Readers are invited
to prove it in the category of groups.
Proof.Letf:A→Bbe an epimorphism in the category of sets. Let g ,h:
B⇒Cbe set morphisms. Let C= 0, 1. Let g(b) = 1ifb∈f(A)andg(b) = 0
otherwise. Let h(b) = 1for all b∈B.g◦f(a) =h◦f(a) = 1for all a∈A. So,
g◦f=h◦fand thus g=hsince fis an epimorphism. This impels B=f(A)
and thus fis surjective.
Letf:A→Bbe a surjective map. Let g ,h:B⇒Cbe set morphisms such
thath 1◦f=h 2◦g. Since fis surjective, B=f(A)and thus for all b∈Bthere
is an element a∈Asuch that b=f(a).h 1(b) =h 1(f(a)) =h 2(f(a)) =h 2(b)
for all b∈A. So, h 1=h 2and thus fis an epimorphism.
Example 9. An injective map is an epimorphism in the category of rings.
Given the morphism i:Z→Q, let h 1 ,h 2:Q→Rwhere Ris another ring
suchthat h 1◦i=h 2◦i. 1R=h 1( 1) =h 1(q/q) =h 1(q)h 1( 1/q)where q∈Z− 0.
So,h 1( 1/q) = 1/h 1(q) =h 1(q)− 1. Similarly, h 2( 1/q) =h 2(q)− 1.h 1(p/q) =
h 1(p)h− 1
1(q) =h 1(i(p))(h 1(i(q)))− 1=h 2(i(p))(h 2(i(q)))− 1=h 2(p/q)where
p∈Z. So, h 1=h 2and thus iis an epimorphism.
