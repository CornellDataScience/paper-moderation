Abstract
This
study
describes
the
development
of
an
expression
system
for
an
oral
Zika
virus
vaccine.
The
vaccine
is
based
on
a
fusion
protein
of
the
cholera
toxin
B
subunit
(CTB)
and
the
Zika
virus
envelope
protein
(E
protein),
connected
via
a
GGSG
linker
and
expressed
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.
The
ADH1
promoter
was
incorporated
into
the
yeast
expression
vector
to
drive
transcription
of
the
fusion
protein.
Yeast
transformants
were
confirmed
through
colony
PCR,
and
initial
protein
expression
was
validated
using
SDS-PAGE.
Introduction
Zika
Virus
Outbreak
and
Health
Implications
The
Zika
virus,
an
arbovirus
within
the
Flavivirus
genus,
gained
global
attention
during
outbreaks
in
2015
and
2016
across
the
Americas,
with
Brazil
as
the
epicenter
(1).
Transmitted
primarily
by
Aedes
mosquitoes,
Zika
infections
led
to
severe
health
outcomes,
particularly
among
pregnant
women,
where
the
virus
is
linked
to
congenital
Zika
syndrome,
including
microcephaly,
brain
calcifications,
and
other
neurological
malformations
in
newborns,
resulting
in
lifelong
developmental
challenges
(2).
In
adults,
Zika
virus
infection
has
been
associated
with
neurological
complications,
such
as
Guillain-Barré
syndrome
(1).
Despite
its
significant
public
health
impact,
vaccine
development
for
Zika
has
faced
challenges,
especially
in
resource-constrained
settings,
highlighting
the
need
for
a
stable,
accessible,
and
easily
administered
vaccine,
such
as
one
based
on
oral
delivery.
Structure
of
Zika
Virus
and
Its
Envelope
Protein
The
Zika
virus
particle
has
a
positive-sense,
single-stranded
RNA
genome
approximately
10.7
kb
in
size,
wrapped
in
a
protein
capsid
and
further
enveloped
by
a
lipid
membrane
derived
from
the
host
cell.
Embedded
within
this
envelope
are
two
major
structural
proteins:
the
membrane
(M)
protein
and
the
envelope
(E)
protein
(3).
The
E
protein
facilitates
viral
attachment
and
entryby
binding
to
host
cell
receptors
and
mediates
membrane
fusion.
Its
immunogenic
nature
makes
it
a
primary
target
for
neutralizing
antibodies,
playing
a
critical
role
in
host
immunity
and
serving
as
an
ideal
antigen
candidate
for
vaccine
development
(4).
AB
Toxins
in
Foodborne
Pathogens
and
the
Immunogenic
Potential
of
B
Subunits
Many
foodborne
pathogens,
such
as
Vibrio
cholerae
(cholera
toxin,
CT)
and
enterotoxigenic
Escherichia
coli
(heat-labile
toxin,
LT),
produce
AB
toxins
characterized
by
an
enzymatically
active
A
subunit
and
a
receptor-binding
B
subunit
(5).
These
B
subunits
bind
host
cell
receptors
like
GM1
ganglioside
without
inducing
toxicity,
presenting
a
unique
opportunity
as
safe,
stable
immunogens.
The
CTB
subunit,
specifically,
binds
intestinal
GM1
receptors,
facilitating
antigen
delivery
and
mucosal
immune
responses
(6).
Studies
have
shown
that
B
subunits
can
be
used
as
antigen
carriers,
triggering
immune
responses
that
extend
protection
without
toxicity
(7).
Vaccine
Design
Concept
Based
on
CTB’s
binding
properties,
we
hypothesized
that
fusing
CTB
with
the
Zika
E
protein,
connected
via
a
GGSG
linker,
would
generate
a
safe
and
effective
oral
vaccine.
CTB’s
binding
to
intestinal
cells
would
enhance
uptake
and
recognition
of
the
Zika
E
protein
as
a
target
antigen
(6).
This
fusion
protein,
expressed
in
yeast,
could
be
heat-dried,
maintaining
structural
stability
and
ensuring
inactivation
of
the
yeast
cells.
This
delivery
system
allows
oral
administration,
improving
accessibility
in
remote
and
resource-limited
areas.

DNA
Work
The
CTB
gene,
a
non-toxic
component
of
cholera

.
Due
to
regulatory
restrictions
on
obtaining
Vibrio

the

Fusion
Gene
Construction
The
CTB
and
Zika
E
genes
were
connected
using
a
GGSG
linker
(sequence:
ggaggatcagga
).
PCR
was
used
to
amplify
the
CTB
and
Zika
E
gene
segments
while
simultaneously
introducing
the
GGSG
linker
at
the
junction
site.
The
final
CTB-linker-E
fusion
construct
was
confirmed
via
sequencing
before
cloning
into
the
yeast
expression
vector.Yeast
Expression
Vector
(pICE-ADE2-HphMx)
The
expression
vector
pICE-ADE2-HphMx
was
obtained
from
Addgene
for
use
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.
However,
the
vector
lacked
a
yeast-compatible
promoter
upstream
of
the
expression
site,
necessitating
the
insertion
of
a
suitable
promoter.
Insertion
of
ADH
Promoter
To
enable
efficient
transcription
of
the
CTB-Zika
E
fusion
gene
in
yeast,
the
ADH1
promoter
was
selected.
The
ADH1
promoter
sequence
was
amplified
by
PCR
from
wild
yeast
(
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
)
genomic
DNA
using
primers
designed
to
include
restriction
sites
for
cloning.
The
primer
sequences
were
as

PCR
Amplification
of
ADH1
Promoter
PCR
amplification
was
performed
using
wild
yeast
genomic
DNA
as
the
template.
The
reaction
conditions
included
high-fidelity
polymerase
to
ensure
accuracy,
and
the
amplified
product
was
purified
and
verified
via
agarose
gel
electrophoresis.
Vector
and
Insert
Preparation
The
recombinant
gene
(ADH1
promoter
-
CTB
-
linker
-
Zika
E
with
BamHI)
and
the
pICE-ADE2-HphMx
vector
were
prepared
for
ligation
using
the
following
steps:
Enzyme
Digestion
:
○
Both
the
gene
insert
and
the
vector
were
digested
with
XhoI
and
BamHI
restriction
enzymes
to
generate
compatible
sticky
ends.
○
The
digestion
reaction
was
performed
under
optimal
conditions
to
ensure
complete
digestion
of
both
DNA
samples.Purification
:
○
The
digested
vector
and
insert
were
purified
using
a
PCR
purification
kit
to
remove
enzymes,
small
fragments,
and
impurities.
○
The
purified
DNA
concentrations
were
measured
using
a
nanodrop
spectrophotometer.
Ligation
:
○
The
purified
insert
and
vector
were
ligated
using
T4
DNA
ligase
in
a
reaction
optimized
for
molar
ratios
of
insert
to
vector.
○
The
ligation
mixture
was
incubated
at
16°C
overnight
to
ensure
efficient
ligation.
Transformation
and
Selection
in
E.
coli(DH5
α)
○
The
ligated
plasmid
was
introduced
into
chemically
competent
E.
coli
DH5
α
cells
using
the
heat-shock
method.
○
Transformed
cells
were
plated
on
LB
agar
plates
containing
ampicillin
(100
µg/mL)
to
select
for
transformants
carrying
the
recombinant
plasmid.
Screening
for
Positive
Clones
:
○
Individual
colonies
were
picked
and
subjected
to
colony
PCR
to
confirm
the
presence
of
the
insert
in
the
plasmid.
○
PCR
products
were
analyzed
via
agarose
gel
electrophoresis,
and
colonies
showing
the
expected
band
size
were
selected
for
further
analysis.
Sequencing
Confirmation
:
○
Positive
clones
were
sequenced
to
verify
the
correct
assembly
of
the
ADH1
promoter,
CTB-linker,
and
Zika
E
gene
construct
within
the
pICE-ADE2-HphMx
vector.
Yeast
Transformation
and
SelectionThe
confirmed
plasmid
was
transformed
into
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
using
the
lithium
acetate
(LiAc)
method.
Transformed
yeast
cells
were
plated
on
hygromycin-containing
selective
media.
Positive
yeast
transformants
were
confirmed
by
colony
PCR,
using
primers
specific
to
the
ADH1-CTB-linker-Zika
E
construct.

Protein
Expression
Analysis
Liquid
Culture
:
○
Positive
yeast
colonies
were
cultured
in
selective
liquid
media
at
30°C
with
shaking.
Protein
Extraction
:
○
Cells
were
harvested
and
lysed
mechanically
using
glass
beads
to
extract
soluble
proteins.
SDS-PAGE
○
Protein
lysates
were
analyzed
by
SDS-PAGE
to
detect
the
expected
molecular
weight
band
for
the
CTB-Zika
E
fusion
protein.
Discussion
The
developed
yeast-based
system
demonstrates
the
feasibility
of
producing
the
CTB-Zika
E
fusion
protein
as
a
candidate
for
an
oral
Zika
vaccine.
The
colony
PCR
results
confirm
the
presence
of
the
construct
in
both
E.
coli
and
yeast
transformants.
Initial
SDS-PAGE
analysis
validates
that
the
fusion
protein
is
being
expressed
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.
Further
work
will
focus
on
the
detailed
characterization
of
the
expressed
protein.
Specifically,
Western
blot
analysis
using
antibodies
specific
to
CTB
and
Zika
E
protein
is
planned
for
confirming
protein
identity
and
integrity.
Additionally,
scaled-up
protein
production
andformulation
into
a
heat-stable
oral
vaccine
format
will
be
explored.
These
steps
will
ensure
the
functional
viability
and
scalability
of
the
vaccine
for
further
testing
and
application.
While
antibody
unavailability
has
delayed
Western
blot
validation,
the
observed
SDS-PAGE
band
provides
strong
preliminary
evidence
of
successful
expression.
Future
characterization
will
help
establish
the
immunogenic
potential
of
the
fusion
protein
and
its
application
in
animal
models
for
further
evaluation.
