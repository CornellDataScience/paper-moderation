Abstract : 
Based on a Cold Genesis pre-quantum theory of particles and fields, (C.G.T.), which explains the 
constituent quarks and the resulted elementary particles as clusters of negatron-positron pairs 
((e-e+)) forming basic z0 -preons of 34 m e which generate preonic bosons z2(4z0)  and z (7z0)  and 
constituent quarks in a preonic model, from two equations, one for the preonic quarks (u, d, s) 
and another for the heavy quarks (c-charm and b-bottom), a single unitary equation is obtained 
for the both mass variants: CGT/Souza and Standard Model, by using four parameters 
representing integer numbers from 0 to 3: (k 1 ; k 2)  3 (for the number of z2- and z - preonic 
bosons);  f = (1;2)- flavor number; n = (1 4) –compositeness number,  and a multiplication factor: 2n-
1-2(n-1) depending on n , the value n=4 giving a predicted quark, of mass 15 GeV/c2. 
Keywords : preons; quarks; flavor; cold genesis; unitary equation; Standard Model 
Introduction : 
   In the Standard Model (S.M.), it is known the constituent quark model, with a valence current 
quark (u-up, d-down, s-strange) or (c-charm, b-bottom, t-top) with a current mass [1]: (1.8 2.8; 
4.35.5; 92 104) MeV/c2, respective: (1.27; 4.18 4.7; 173) GeV/c2 and a gluonic shell formed 
by gluons and  sea-quarks [1], the resulting effective quark mass being the constituent quark 
mass: m u = 336, m d = 340, m s = 486 (MeV/c2) respective:  m c = 1.55, m b = 4.73, m t = 177 
(GeV/c2). 
  The electric charge of u-, c-, t- quarks is +(2/3)e and the electric charge of d-, s-, b- quarks  is –
(1/3)e, the strong interaction of quarks being explained by so-named “color charge ”,  the gluons 
having two opposed color charges, the gluon field between a pair of color charges forming a 
narrow flux tube (as a string) between them, (Lund ’s string model [2]).  
     In a Cold Genesis pre-quantum theory of particles and fields, (C.G.T., [9-12]), based on 
Galilean relativity,   it results- as a more natural alternative, the possibility to explain the 
constituent quarks and the resulted elementary particles as clusters of negatron-positron pairs, 
named ‘gammons ’ ((e-e+)), resulting that preonic bosons and quarks can also be formed ‘at 
cold’, as Bose-Einstein condensate of ‘gammons ’ which form quasi-stable basic preons z0 of 
mass 34 m e , forming constituent quarks, (M. Arghirescu, 2006, [9], p. 58).     
 This z0 -preon was deduced by calibrating the value: m k = m e/2 = 68.5m e obtained by Olavi 
Hellman [13], by using the masses of the proton and of the -baryon, [9].  
   The existence of  a boson having a mass of  34 m e was evidenced by a research team of the 
Science ’ Institute for Nuclear Research in  Debrecen (Hungary), [14], which evidenced a neutral 
super-light particle with a mass of 17 MeV/c2 , (34 m e), named X17, by a reaction: 
       Li7 + p+ → Be*  →Be8 + b0 ;        b0→ e+ + e-  ,            m(b0)  34 m e   ,                 (1)            This reaction was explained in CGT by the conclusion that z0-preon is composed by two 
‘quarcins ’, c0, its stability being explained in CGT by the conclusion that it is formed as a 
cluster of an even number n = 7x6 = 42 quasielectrons, (integer number of degenerate 
“gammons ”,  *(e*- e*+)), with mass m e*  34/42 = 0.8095 m e, i.e. reduced to a value  
corresponding to the charge e* = (2/3)e by a degeneration of  the magnetic moment ’s quantum 
vortex  =  A +B generated around superdense centroids and given by ‘heavy ’ etherons of 
mass ms  10-60kg and ‘quantons ’ of mass m h = h1/c2 = 7.37x10-51 kg.  
   The considered “gammons ” were experimentally observed in the form of quanta of “un-
matter ” plasma, [15]. 
In CGT, the fractional charge of quarks is given by a quasielectron –for e* = (2/3)e , and by a 
quasielectron and an electron with degenerate mas,  magnetic moment, attached to a neutral 
cluster of paired quasi-electrons. 
The light and semi-light cold quarks which give the masses of the astro-particles results in CGT 
as superpositions of preonic bosons  z 2 = 4z0  and z  = 7z0 with almost the same symmetry ( ‘star’ 
and hexagon, figure 1, [10;11]), conform to a constituent quark ’ mass equation of the form :  
        1 2 1-
2 1 1,2 2 1 2 1 1,2 k 2 0 k   3); 0   k   ;   ) m  ; (m   m       ;  z 2) -  (kk   z k    ) M(m      =  = =   +  ++ =  Mq           (2)                                        
i.e: -(k1 , k 2  = 0)  q = m1,2 ;    (k 1 = 1, k 2 = 0 )  q = r  , (“rark” - un-stable quark);   (k 1 = 2)  
   q = p+, n-; - (k1 = 3, k 2 = 0)  q =  ; (k1 = 3, k 2 = 1 )  q = s ; (k1 = 3, k 2 = 2)  q = v.     
The particle ’s mass results by eq. (2) in the approximation of the sum rule applied to the 
particle ’s cold forming, as consequence of the quantum fields ’ superposition principle applied to 
the particle ’s cold forming as sum of degenerate electrons, whose total vortical field v can 
explain also the nuclear force Fn = -Vn(r), [10, 11 ].

For the constituent quarks heavier than the nucleonic quarks it was found the next structure [16]: 
a) ms = 0.5 GeV/c2 = 978.5 m e ( ms* = 987.8 m e, 0.504GeV/c2 ) -the mass of s-quark ; 
b) mc = 1.7 GeV/c2 = 3326.8 m e –charm quark ’s mass used by de Souza [17], and: 
c)   m b  5 GeV –bottom quark ’s mass used by de Souza [17],   
d)  m t  175 GeV, the t-quark ’s mass, with current mass resulting as prismatic cluster: 
             t  = (7x5)m(b) = (17( 𝑏𝑏̅) + b),         (super-heavy quark)                                    (3)  
     The masses m c and m b (of quarks charm and bottom) were obtained in CGT by Eq.: 
            𝑀𝑛¤(𝑞𝑛)   𝑀 13𝑛−1 ;    q n =  [( 𝑞𝑞 ̅)𝑞 ]n-1                                                                     (4) 
obtained by Karrigan Jr. [18] for quarks of S.M., (for masses: m 2• = m c• = 1.55 GeV/c2 and:  m 3• 
= m•b = 4.73 GeV/c2 , with: m 1•(q1) = m s•  0.486GeV/c2), but in the form: 
         𝑀𝑛(𝑞𝑛𝑐)   3𝑛−1[𝑀1−𝑧0
3(2𝑛 − 3 )] ,(𝑛 > 1 );                                                           (5a) 
(n- compositeness number),   or- taking into account and the loosing of some internal bosons 
(photons –in CGT and gluons in S.M.) corresponding to the binding energy of composite m n –
quark forming, by the approximated form:  
               𝑀𝑛(𝑞𝑛𝑐)   3𝑛−1[𝑀1−𝑧0
3𝑙𝑛(3𝑛−13𝑛−2)]                                                                 (5b) 
by taking : M 1 = m v*  1121.2 m e   0.574 GeV (-the mass of cold v-quark of CGT, instead of 
ms•), and by considering the resulting quarks c+ (charm) and b- (bottom) as de-excited states of 
the triplet M n(𝑞𝑛𝑐)  with mass: M (c*) = 3M v*(v+) = 3363.6 m e,  (1.718 GeV/c2), and respective: 
M(b*) = 3M c   5.1 GeV/c2, (q* -‘cold’ quark),  by the next de-excitation reactions specific to 
Eqs. (5), (with the released mass proportional to the quarks ’ binding energy):    
                   𝑐∗[𝑣𝑣̅̅̅̅̅𝑣] → 𝑐+ 𝑧0(34𝑚𝑒)                                                                          (6a)  
         𝑏∗[𝑐𝑐̅̅̅̅̅𝑐] → 𝑏+ 𝑧 3(204 𝑚𝑒);     (z3 = z  = (2x3)z0 = 2z 1)                                      (6b)                 
The quarks of the S.M. result as de-excited quarks of CGT: s- , c+ , b- , by the reactions: 
 𝑐(1700 )→𝑐•(1561 )+0(2𝑧 2);  𝑏(5000 )→𝑏•(4756 )+ 𝑧 6(2𝑧); 𝑠(504 )→𝑠•(486 )+ 𝑧0   (7) 
i.e. by an equation which explains the reactions (7) of the form: 
                              𝑀(𝑞𝑛•)   3𝑛−1[𝑀1− [•−𝑧0
3(𝑛 − 2 )]]                                                    (8a) 
      with:               [(M 1 - •)  = (2m s +m v – z0)/3] ,          ( • = 52.45 MeV/c2)   
or- taking into account the increasing of the vortical field with 𝑚𝑛𝑐(𝑞𝑛•), approximately by: 
               𝑀𝑛𝑐(𝑞𝑛•)   3𝑛−1[(𝑀 1−) +𝑧0
3ln 3𝑛−2]  ;       (  = 55 MeV/c2)                            (8b) 
the value   55 MeV/c2 being obtained by taking 𝑀𝑛𝑐(𝑛 = 3 )= 4. 73  MeV/c2 (the known 
experimental value), giving:  n = 2 → m(q 2•)c2 = 1.557 GeV  m(c•);  n = 3 → m(q 3•)c2 = 4.728 
GeV, values almost equal to the known masses of the constituent charm- and bottom- quarks 
experimentally determined, (1.55 GeV/c2, respective:  4.73 GeV/c2).     In another paper of the author [19 ] , it was obtained –from Eqs. (5b) and (8b), a single 
equation for the masses of the composite constituent quarks of cold genesis (Souza/CGT variant) 
and of hot genesis (S.M. ’s variant), in the form: 
                         M(qnf) = 3n-1{m v –(2-f) -(z0/3)ln[3(2n-3)/3(2-f)(3n-5)]}                                               (9) 
in which: m v = m(v)  574 MeV/c2;  = 55 MeV/c2  and f = fq =  (f 1 = 1; f 2 = 2) -flavors numbers 
of composite quarks: q n•(S.M.) and q ns (CGT), (named ‘quarkonics ’, in CGT [19 ]). 
Eq. (9), by f  = fq = 1 retrieves Eq. (8b) for m(q n•) and by f  = fq = 2 it retrieves Eq. (5b) for m(q ns) . 
2. The obtaining of a single equation for almost all composite quarks masses 
The possibility to unify the equations (2) and (9) in a single equations for all light, is to write in 
Eq. (9) the Eq. (2) instead of m v and (z0 + ) instead of , ( = 37.63 MeV/c2), and to multiply 
the last part of Eq. (9) with q, q being the sum: q = (2n -1- 2n-1), which gives: q = 0 for  
n = 1, q = 1 for n = 2 or 3  and  q = 1 for n = 4.  It results the equation:

(M1;2 = 69.5 MeV/c2  (1/)me;  = 37.63 MeV/c2; f = 1, for S.M. ’s variant, being applicable 
only for k 1 >2). 
It is observed that for n = 1 it is retrieved the Eq. (2) for the preonic quarks, (light and semi-
light), and for (k 1 + k 2) = 5; n >1, it is retrieved Eq. (9) and taking e(2n-3)/e(2-f)(3n- 5) instead of 3(2n-
3)/3(2-f)(3n- 5) there are obtained –with f = 1, 2, the Eqs. (5a) and (8a) corresponding to the 
de-excitation reactions (6) and (7) and to the sum rule. 
    The differences per m v-quark resulting between Eqs. (5a) and (5b): 
   q = -(z0/3)[ ln3(2n- 3) -(2n - 3)] < 0 can be explained in CGT by the conclusion that a bigger 
mass of composite quark imply an increasing binding energy between their constituents 
(smaller quarks) determined by a higher vortical attractive force per v-quark and an 
increased quantity of loosed internal photons per v-quark, at their confining into a 
composite quark. 
    The difference per m v-quark resulting between Eqs. (8a) and (8b): 
   q• = (z0/3)[ ln3(n-2) -(n -2)] > 0 can be explained in CGT by the conclusion that a bigger 
mass of composite quark formed by de-excitation of its metastable state imply a mass-
depending decreasing of the quantity of loosed internal photons per v-quark, at the de-
excitation of the meta-stable composite quark, determined by a higher vortical attractive 
force per v-quark for a higher mass of the metastable composite quark. 
This interpretation results by the fact that the quantity (z0/3)ln3(n-2) is subtracted from 
the quantity  = 55 MeV/c2 is subtracted from the constituent mass of the v-quark, the difference (  - (z0/3)ln3(n-2)) being given by two z0-preons and a quantity of released photons, 
the value: [  - 2z0 - (z0/3)ln3(n-2)] representing a quantity of released photons per v-quark, (the 
value 2z0 representing the mass of two released z0-preons per v-quark ). 
   The current masses of quarks results in CGT according to a semi-empiric relation inspired by 
the proportionality: M p2  (m q1 + m q2), specific to the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation [20]), resulting 
as ansatz in the form [21]:                                         
                                       𝑚𝑞= 𝑀 𝑞− 𝛥 𝑞= 𝑀 𝑞− 𝐴 𝑞⋅ 𝑒𝑘𝑞⋅(1−𝑀𝑆•2

𝑀𝑒𝑉/𝑐2;                 (17)         
  with M s• = M s•(486MeV) – the constituent mass of s• –quark. The constants A q, kq, were obtained by 
taking: m d = 7.5 MeV/c2 [21] and m (s•) = 91 MeV/c2 [21], ( q = Ms• -m(s•) = 395 MeV /c2), resulting that: 
Aq = s• = 395 MeV/c2 ;   kq = 0.182 , and: m c•’ = 1091 MeV/c2 ,  m b•’ = 4257 MeV/c2.

 Conclusions 
  Based on a Cold Genesis pre-quantum theory of particles and fields, (C.G.T.), based on 
Galilean relativity,   which explains the constituent quarks and the resulted elementary particles 
as clusters of negatron-positron pairs ( (e-e+)) forming basic z0 -preons of 34 m e which generate 
preonic bosons z2(4z0)  and z (7z0)  and constituent quarks in a preonic model, from two equations, 
one for the preonic quarks (u, d, s) and another for the heavy quarks (c-charm and b-bottom), a 
single unitary equation is obtained for the both mass variants: CGT/Souza and Standard Model, 
by using four parameters representing integer numbers from 0 to 3: (k 1 ; k 2)  3 (for the number 
of z2- and z - preonic bosons);  f = (1;2)- flavor number; n = (1 4) –compositeness number,  and a 
multiplication factor depending on n , n=4 giving a predicted quark, of mass 15 GeV/c2. 
The values of constituent quarks masses in the S.M. ’s variant result by the CGT ’s unitary 
formula with discrepancy under 1%, excepting the case of the u/d-quarks, (M u/d = 312; 313 
GeV/c2 –in CGT).  
It must be mentioned that also the Standard Model uses two massic variants of the 
constituent quarks, for baryons the constituent mass being higher than that known for 
mesons and of value depending on the choosed model, for example [22] :  
Mu/d = 362 MeV/c2;  Ms = 540 MeV/c2; M c = 1710 MeV/c2; M b = 5044 MeV/c2, 
 The difference being explained by the conclusion that the mass of the strange quark, in 
presence of a heavy antiquark, is smaller, [22], (for example: 308 MeV/c2 –for the u/d- quark, 
instead of 336 362 –in the baryons ’ case, [22] ).
