Abstract   In contrast with Special Relativity, the Lorentzian formulation allows absolute 
motion of the laboratory against  a putative preferred frame of reference to be revealed by small 
but non-zero signal s in Michelson -Morley experiments with light beams passing through  a 
refractive medium.  Testing th is hypothesis, we developed a rotating Mach -Zehnder  
interferometer  to compare  the phase velocity of light in gas and vacuum. The new experiment 
reduces by three orders of magnitude the drift velocity against a preferred frame derived from 
historical Michelson -Morley data under the assumptions of Lorentzian Relativity , rendering 
this formulation untenable .  
 
1  Introduction  
 
The concept of a preferred frame of reference, such as the luminiferous aether of 19th century 
electromagnetic theory, was rendered superfluous in Special Relativity  (SR) by the universal 
equivalence of  inertial frames  [Einstein, 1905] . The isotropy and constancy of the vacuum 
speed of light in this formulation guarantee d a null result in M ichelson -Morley  (M-M) 
experiments.  SR has been orthodox  for so long now that competing explanations for the 
experimental data are all but forgotten. Occasionally however, well -reasoned arguments [e.g. 
Consoli  & Pluchino , 2023] are presented in favor of an earlier theoretical framework, 
Lorentzian Relativity (LR), which was the consensus of such luminaries as HA Lorentz, Henri 
Poincar√© , Joseph Larmor and George F Fitzgerald around the year 1900.  
In LR, a preferred frame of reference is concealed by a conspiracy of clock aberration 
and length contraction, rendering  absolute  motion  undetectable and  ensuring null results for 
M-M experiments  [Lorentz, 1904] . The conventional  view , formulated early in the 20th century 
and persisting  to this day, holds  that LR is experimentally indistinguishable  from SR  [Consoli 
& Pluchino, 2018 b].  
Arguments have been presented , however,  that the expe rimental equivalence of S R and 
the L R is exact  only in vacuum. As several authors have pointed out,  LR predicts null results 
of M-M experiments  because  changes in light speed  due to motion against the preferred frame  
are compensated by changes in the length of interferometer arms . Such compensation would  
no longer be exact if light were  slowed  in the optical pathways  by a refractive medium [Cahill 
& Kitto, 2002; Cahill & Kitto, 2003;  Consoli & Costanzo, 2003;  Dmitriyev, 2011;  Consoli, 
Matheson & Pluchino, 2013 ; Consoli, & Pluchino , 2021 ; Consoli  & Pluchino , 2023 ]. Early M -
M experiments were conducted in atmospheric air (refractive index, n ‚âà 1.000  290), or later 
helium  (n ‚âà 1.000  030). The signal residuals reported were well short of classical predictions, 
justify ing their traditional description as a ‚Äúnull result,‚Äù but were  in fact  never precisely zero  
[Hicks, 1902 ; Miller, 1933 ].  
It has been proposed that the  small  signal  residuals  in historical M -M experiments  were 
actually consistent w ith relevant cosmic velocities if proper account is taken of the refractive 
medium in the optical pathways  [Cahill & Kitto, 2002; Consoli  & Pluchino , 2023]. The signal 
in a Michelson interferometer moving  with velocity, v, against the preferred frame in LR was 
predicted to be proportional  to the refractivity of the medium, Œµ = n ‚Äì 1 ‚âà 3 ÔÇ¥ 10‚Äì4 for air, and 
to v2/c2, of the order of  10‚Äì6 for the  velocity of the solar system with respect to  the frame in 
which  the dipole anisotropy of the  Cosmic Microwave Background  (CMB)  radiation  vanishes , 
v = 369.82  ¬± 0.11 km/s [Planck Collaboration, 2020] . The combination of these  small factors 
indicates that a Michelson interferometer of any practical dimensions could yield  only miniscule signals, comparable to the level of  noise and systematics characteristic of the old 
instruments.  Distinguishing such signals from the  precise null predicted by a nalyses  using the 
full mathematical machinery of SR [Sfarti, 2009, 2011; Shanahan, 2014 ] remains contentious 
and arguments favorin g the LR interpretation with a pref erred frame of reference are at best 
plausible rather than convincing.  
A novel M -M experiment  was recently developed , employing  a rotating  Mach -Zehnder 
interferometer instead of the Michelson  configuration  to specifically  measure  the difference 
between the phase velocities of light  in gas and vacuum  [Manley, 2023;  Manley, 2024] . Under 
the assumptions of LR, the new interferometer deliver s a fringe -shift signal proportional to the 
first power of  v/c. Gaining orders of magnitude in sensitivity compared with the Michelson 
design  by virtue of the first -order response and the electronic regist ration of fringes to 10‚Äì4 Œª, 
this innovation  permits the definitive  testing  of the LR interpretation of M -M experiments .  
 
2  Historical M ichelson -Morley  experiments  
 
The critical factor in a ny decisive experimental test is the magnitude of the signal in relation to 
the noise floor of the instrument . Interpretation of the historical data from M -M experiments 
requires  the examination of  signals at or near the limits of detection . Rather than simply 
perusing the well -known theory predicting the magnitude of fringe shifts in a rotating 
interferometer, it  is therefore  instructive to carry out precise numerical calculations  (Table 1 ).  
Let us first  review  the historical experiments of  Dayton C Miller in the 1920s with a  
huge  Michelson interferometer  at Mt Wilson, near the astronomical observatory  site [Miller, 
1933]. Among the records of historical Michelson -Morley experiments, Miller‚Äôs dataset was 
the most extensive, totaling around 200,000 fringe shift readings recorded during 12,500 
rotations of the  largest interferometer constructed  in that er a. Despite the widespread 
acceptance of SR, Miller had remained convinced of a luminiferous aether acting as a preferred 
frame and dismissed the idea of Fitzgerald -Lorentz length contraction, attributing the shortfall 
of signal amplitudes in M -M experiment s to the aether being ‚Äúdragged‚Äù by matter. This belief 
motivated his years of repetitive work, resulting in a substantial  data archive.

the right relative to a preferred frame of ref erence . On the right,  the optical paths in an 
implementation  with 16 mirrors , used by Dayton C Miller in the 1920s  at Mt Wilson .  
 
Since the aim of the M -M experiment was to detect directional variations in the speed 
of light, it may seem logical to place  the observer  with the instrument at rest in the laboratory. 
A more convincing  interpretation, however, comes from considering the o bserver to be at rest 
in the preferred frame while the interferometer moves (Fig. 1).  
The phase velocity  of light in the preferred fr ame is by definition isotropic . Our task is 
to calculate the relationship betw een the translational velocity and the shift  in the interference 
fringe pattern  caused by the difference in transit times for the wavefront in the arm parallel to 
the direction of motion and the arm perpendicular to the motion. The schematic of  Miller‚Äôs 
practical implementation of the Michelson inte rferometer [Miller, 1933] is illustrated  in Fig. 1.  
The 19th century analysis  assumed the linear addition of velocities inherent in  classical physics 
and Galilean Relativity  [Michelson & Morley, 1887].  Compar ing the two -way transit times of 
light in orthog onal limbs of length, L, as the instrument moves  against the preferred frame at  
velocity, v, predict ed a peak -to-peak fringe shift  on rotation , ŒîN, given by:

In Miller‚Äôs instrument , the effective  arm length  was 32.030 m. The term 2 L/Œª was  
quoted as  1.12 ÔÇ¥ 108, implying an approximate  wavelength  for the yellow light from the oil 
lamp used in most of the work , Œª = 572 nm . The objective of the historical M -M experiments  
was detection of the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun  at v ‚âà 30 km/s, v/c ‚âà 10‚Äì4.  
Replicating Miller‚Äôs design calculations,  we commence with the instrument static in the 
preferred frame (Table 1 , values are femtoseconds ). Neglecting the refractivity of air, we 
assume light propagates at its vacuum velocity of cvac ‚â° 299 792 458 m/s , so the transit times 
for a light wavefront are simply  T0 = L/cvac = 106 840 579.691  968 fs, in each of the four 
directions . The wavelength, Œª = 572 nm, corresponds to a period of  1.907  987 fs. Calculations  
were implemented  at 15 significant figures, but rounded down  in the table  for readability.   
Next, we consider the instrument moving at the Earth‚Äôs orbital velocity, v = 30 km/s 
(Table 1, group 2). A light wavefront, leaving the beamsplitter to travel along the arm paralle l 
to the direction of motion, overtakes the optical components at a speed, c ‚Äì v. In the reverse 
direction, the wavefront advances at a relative speed, c + v. We note that the transit times are 
increased for the outward journey, decreased for the backward, but sum to a total which has 
increased compared with the static case. For ease of reading, numerical values in the table are 
shown as differences from the s tatic value of the transit time, T0.  
The calculations for the arm perpendicular to the direction of motion are more intricate. 
The effect of motion against the preferred frame on light travel in the perpendicular arm was 
neglected in the earliest formulat ion of M -M experiments, which assumed that any such effect 
would be negligible [Cassini & Levinas , 2024]. Considering the effect of motion, we see that 
the beamsplitter has moved to the right during the travel of the wavefront out to the mirror and 
back (F ig. 1). The path lengths for light in the perpendicular arm are therefore no longer exactly 
L, but instead are the hypotenuse lengths of two (very narrow) right angled triangles. The 
increase in time in the perpendicular arm turns out to be half that in th e parallel arms.  
The difference between light propagation times in the two arms, under the assumptions 
of Galilean Relativity, with light propagating at its vacuum speed and motion against the 
preferred frame at a velocity of 30 km/s, was predicted to be about 1.07 fs, which is 0.56 of the 
period of the 572 nm light. Rotation effectively interchanges the arms of the instrument with 
each 90 degrees of turn, so the peak -to-peak shift in the interference fringe pattern becomes 
twice the difference from the st atic case. Miller expected a shift, Œî N ‚âà 1.12 Œª, which would 
have been easily quantifiable as he read the fringe pattern by eye against a pointer, calling 
values in tenths of the fringe period for an assistant to record. Miller‚Äôs copious records show, 
howe ver, that the signal actually observed was an order of magnitude smaller than expectation, 
right at the limit of readability, Œî N ‚âà 0.1 Œª.

In contrast with Miller‚Äôs expectations based on classical physics and Galilean 
Relativity, LR predicts a null result in vacuum (Table 1, group 3). The Lorentz -Fitzgerald 
contraction of the parallel arm reduces  its length from L = 32.030 m to L/Œ≥ = 32.029 9 99 840 
m, without affecting the perpendicular arm. T he two-way travel time s for the light wavefront  
in the parallel and perpendicular arms now match precisely . In vacuum, the prediction of LR  
is a null result .  
With light propagating in a  refractive medium,  LR no longer predicts a null result  
(Table 1, group 5) . In atmospheric air,  with n = 1.0002 90, light speed reduces  from  the value  
cvac ‚â° 299 792 458 m/s to cvac/n = 299 705 543.392  416 m/s, a decrease of 0.029 %. We have a 
new value for wavefront transit times in the static case, Ta = 106 871 563.460 079 fs (Table 1, 
group 4). With the instrument  moving, the Lorentz -Fitzgerald length contraction, still governed 
by the vacuum speed of light , no longer  compensates for the increase in transit time caused by 
motion against the preferred frame . The predicted signal  at 30 km/s , ŒîN = 0.0006 51 Œª, though 
quite undetectable  in the  era of the historical M-M experiments , is definitively non -zero.  
In contrast with SR, which  of course  predicts an exact null result for M -M experiments 
in any instrument al configuration,  we see that  LR predicts a non -zero signal whe n light in the 
optical pathways propagates through  a refractive medium.   The question immediately follows : what cosmic velocity would have yielded  a readable 
fringe shift with the equipment and techniques employed  by Miller in  his 1933  report ?  
Estimating fringe positions by eye,  Miller  reported a shift , ŒîN ‚âà 0.1 Œª . Under the 
assumptions of LR, this exact value of fringe shift would occur  at a velocity , v = 371.880  km/s , 
with air of refractive index,  n = 1.0002 90 in the optical pathways  (Table 1, group 6) . The 
agreement with the CMB dipole velocity  of 369.82 km/s  [Planck Collaboration, 2020]  is 
striking  [Cahill & Kitto, 2002; Consoli  & Pluchino , 2023 ].  
The skeptical reader will immediately  suspect that the figures have been rigged to give 
such a precise  agreement. The suspicious value is the refractive index of a ir, which in reality 
varies with barometric pressure and temperature. The values of 1.000 280 or 1.000 290 found in 
the literature discussing the L R interp retation of historical M -M experiments are plausible at 
sea level. At 1013  hPa pressure , a temperature of 20 C and relative humidity of 50%  (typical 
for the author‚Äô s laboratory  at an elevation of only 40 m above mean sea level  in Brisbane, 
Australia ) the refractive index  of air  is n = 1.000 273.  
Miller , however,  worked  at the Mt Wilson site . The example record sheet shown in his 
1933  report  was for September 23, 192 5, 2:57 to 3:19 AM at temperatures of 13.8‚Äì14.1 C . The 
barometric pressure was not recorded, but the site was at 1,740 m  elevation, where air at 14 C 
has a standard pressure of 824 hPa. The NIST online calculator gives  n = 1.000 226. The cosmic 
velocity  needed for a fringe shift value  of ŒîN = 0.1  increases to 421 km/s. This is still of the 
correct order, but the phenomenal m atch to the CMB dipole velocity reported in the literature 
for the  refractive index,  n = 1.000 290, clearly represents a triumph of enthusiasm over reali sm.  
A further complication in analysis of M -M experiments is  the Fresnel drag effect, in 
which  the velocity of light is altered by interaction with a moving medium.  The equation  below 
[Janssen, 2013 ] predicts  the phase velocity of lig ht, cnv, in a medium  of refractive index, n,  
moving at velocity, v. Under LR , where velocities add linearly,  the equation is valid,  though  
under SR, where  velocity  addition is nonlinear , it is only  applicable for  v << c  [Sfarti, 2011].

For atmospheric air, n = 1.000273, the expression in brackets evaluates to 0.000546 . At 
the CMB dipole velocity of v = 369.82 km/s , the Fresnel drag effect alters the  speed of light in 
the moving refractive medium by  only 0.202 km/s.  We could calculate the effect of this change 
on transit times in the interferometer, but there is a simpler workaround  in the LR framework . 
Let us move our observer from the preferred frame of reference to a new frame moving in the 
direction of the drag a t an appropriate ly small velocity, 0.000546 v. In this new frame, light 
propagation is isotropic, and our calculation s remain qualitatively valid, with only a small  
quantitative error .  
In contrast with the calculations above, SR predicts a null result  (Table 1, group 7). An 
exact calculation cannot use the Fresnel drag equation, valid only as v ‚Üí 0. Instead, we must 
employ the transformation formulae for velocities as view ed from relatively moving frames. A 
wavefront moving at a velocity, wx, with resp ect to a local frame which moves at velocity, v, 
in the x-direction  is seen by an observer at rest to be moving at velocity, ux, given by:

As light in vacuum is always observed at the same speed in SR, the equation of course 
yields u = c for the case where w = c. For speeds approaching the limit set by the vacuum speed 
of light, such as the (slightly) reduced velocity of light in gas, the non linear velocity addition 
in SR has a drastic effect. Adding or subtracting the CMB dipole velocity , v = 369.82  km/s , to 
the phase velocity of light in air alters  that velocity, as seen by our observer at rest, by only +0.214 or ‚Äì0.215  km/s.  The increment in the two -way transit time for the light wavefront in 
the parallel arm in SR is less than that calculated under the assumptions of LR where  addition 
of velocities  is linear  (Table 1, group 7 vs. group 6).  
The calculation for the perpendicul ar arm is  rather intricate, complicated by  the vector 
calculation of the velocity in the diagonal path , but reduces to the simple expression, 2 Œ≥nL/cvac, 
matching the ti me for the parallel arm exactly  and so yielding the null result . We also note that 
an observer moving with the instrument would measure the time for the two -way transit of the 
wavefront in each arm as 2 nL/cvac. Our static observer in the preferred frame sees the moving 
observer‚Äôs clock running slow, introducing the Œ≥-factor.  
A null result for M -M experiments in SR follows  immediately without calculation , of 
course, from the assumption of universal equivalen ce of inertial frames. All observers must 
record readings from experimental apparatus which are independent of their state of motion.  
We conclude that LR predicts a different result from SR , when M -M experiments are 
conducted with  a refractive medium in the optical paths. The calculations in Table 1 reveal  the 
origin of this difference. Departing from the assumptions of classical physics and Galilean 
Relativity, SR requires comparison of measurements in relatively -moving inertial frames to 
conform to the Lorentz transformations of length and time, to the no nlinear addition of 
velocities, and  to the relativity of simultaneity. Predict ing a null result for M -M experiments in 
vacuum requires only  that classical expectations be augmented by the  Lorentz -Fitzgerald 
length contraction. With a refractive medium  in the optical paths , a null prediction also requires 
the nonlinear addition of velocities, respecting the light speed limit. Thus LR, which retains 
the classical assumption of linear velocity addition, predicts a small fringe shift with gas -filled 
Michelson i nterferometers moving against a preferred frame of reference , while SR predicts a 
null.  
The interpretation of the signal residuals in historical M -M experiments remains a topic 
of ongoing deb ate in the literature. If a preferred frame of reference were  definitively  detected, 
revision of a substantial tract of physical dogma would be required. Conservative opinion 
demands the signals be dismissed as noise and systematics of thermal origin [Shankland et al., 
1955]. It is apparent that further analysis of his torical records is unlikely to convince either side 
of the debate. New data is required.  
 
3  A new M -M experiment  testing L orentzian Relativity  
 
The mainstream literature dismisses the sig nal residuals in early M -M experiments as 
instrumental systematics which diminish ed with technological progress over time , essentially  
vanishing with modern cryogenic experiments  in vacuum  or dense solids . The limits on Lorentz 
symmetry violation  have been pushed down to Œî c/c ÔÇ£ 10‚Äì18 in contemporary work  [Muller et 
al., 2003;  Tobar et al., 2006; M√ºller et al., 2007 ; Nagel et al., 2015 ]. If there is any interesting 
physics driving the anomalous signals  in the historical data, it must be a function of the gas (air 
or helium) in the optical pathways of the old in struments. The Lorentzian interpretation of 
relativity , where motion against a preferred frame of reference  might  be revealed by reducing 
the phase velocity of light  with a refractive medium , retains  sufficient plausibility to justify 
investigation .  
How might LR be tested in a modern laboratory ? The notion  of rebuilding one of the 
historical instruments, such as Miller‚Äôs gigantic device, is preposterous. But today‚Äôs  optics and 
electronics allows  the construct ion of  a device of benchtop  dimensions  which  matches or 
exceed s the sensitivity of the historical experiments  to anomalous propagation of light in gas  
[Manley , 2023, 2024] .  
While developing a  modern experiment , our conceptual breakthrough was separating 
tests for anisotropic refractivity in gases from tests of L ocal Lorentz Invariance . Since we know 
that light propagation in vacuum is isotropic to accuracy well beyond the anomalies we seek to 
study in gas, it follows that instead of testing ort hogonal paths in air, as in the historical M -M 
experiments, we should test light propagation in air against propagation in vacuum.  Thus we no longer require the  orthogonal light paths of a traditional Michelson interferometer but are 
able to  employ a Mach -Zehnder design  with optical paths parallel and adjacent (Fig. 2) .  
By avoiding  the awkward engineering of the Michelson design with its cross layout, we 
greatly improve mechanical stability . The theory of the instrument is simplified , the vacuum 
reference provid ing a perfect clock (constant length traversed at constant speed) against which 
to compare light propagation through t he gas -filled path . Whereas  the Michelson‚Äôs  two-way 
measure of light transit times incurs a  response  proportional to v2/c2 or (Œîc/c)2, the Mach -
Zehnder instrument‚Äôs one-way measurement confers a fringe shift signal  which is  first order  in 
Œîc/c. And Lorentz -Fitzgerald length contraction has negligible effect as it would influence  the 
adjacent parallel  pathways equall y.  
 
 
 
Fig. 2  Concept of a Mach -Zehnder interferometer  testing for an anomaly of light propagation 
in gas . From modern experiments, we can be certain that a rotating  Michelson interferometer 
would show a zero signal  in vacuum . Historical gas -filled instruments , however,  presented  
small anomalous fringe shift s. The Mach -Zehnder design directly compares gas with vacuum.   
 
In a practical implementation of this concept [Manley, 2024],  the straight path used for 
the gas (test) and vacuum (reference) beams  was 530 mm , 1.00 ÔÇ¥ 106 Œª for the 532 nm light 
from a diode -pumped solid -state laser  (Thorlabs CPS532 -C2). With electronic recording of 
interference fringe position , data from the instrument was taken in hourly blocks of 72 rotations 
with a period of 50 s  per rotation  (0.02 Hz) . Fringe shift readings were  recorded at 16 equally -
spaced azimuth values during each rotation  (an experimental design chosen to echo  Miller‚Äôs 
1933 report) .  
 
 
 
Fig. 3  Representative data from the new Mach -Zehnder interferometer. Left panel: signal 
treated as repeated measures of fringe shift readings at 16 azimuth directions during rotation  
(means ÔÇ± S.E.M, n = 72). Cosine waves were fitted by least squares at the rota tion frequency 
(red, 0.02 Hz) and second harmonic (green, 0.04 Hz). Middle panel: amplitudes of harmonic 
components fitted by least squares from the fundamental up to the Nyquist limit (half the 
sampling frequency of 0.32 Hz). Right panel: Fourier spectrum  of data treated as a continuous 
stream of readings at 0.32 Hz , after digital filtering to suppress  baseline drift.  
 
An illustrative example of processed data is shown in Fig. 3. Treating the data as 72 
repetitions of fringe position measurements at each of the 16 azimuth values yielded a plot of 
the fringe shift during rotation as means ÔÇ± standard errors of the means (S EM) with harmonic 
components fitted by least squares (Fig. 3, left panel; harmonic amplitudes in middle panel). 
Alternatively, the data could be treated as a continuous stream of 1152 readings taken at equal 
intervals, a format suitable for Fourier analysi s. The spectrum revealed broadband noise in 
addition to a spike at the rotation frequency and often a (much smaller) spike at the second 
harmonic (Fig. 3, right panel). Variation in the amplitude of the fundamental remained in the 
range of 0.1 up to 1.0 in  units of Œª/1000 during daily and seasonal variations [Manley, 2024].  
A significant innovation in the new design was the control configurati on. Traditional 
M-M experiments, from  the historical interferometers to modern devices  with resonant cavities, 
have thus far provided a data stream consisting  of putative signals summed with noise and the 
systematics caused by rotation. There has been no means of sup pressing the signal to provide  
control data containing noise and syste matic s alone. With the new Mach -Zehnder design, 
physically meaningful signals were suppressed when the optical paths were balanced, the data 
consisting entirely of systematics and noise. Unbalancing the paths then permit ted a putative 
genuine signal to add into  the data stream, to be revealed as components of increased amplitude 
and/or altered phase compared with the controls  [Manley, 2023, 2024] .  
In the control configuration (vacuum cell removed so test and reference beams 
traversed  matching paths in air ) the noise floor of the  new instrument was 0.072 ¬± 0.004 in 
units of Œª/1000  (n = 81) . Removal or reinstallation of the vacuum cell (mass ‚âà 0.3  kg) involved 
only minimal disturbance to the mechanics of the rotating chassis (mass ‚âà 20 kg) carrying the 
optical com ponents.  
Unlike the  analysis of the  Michelson interferometer in traditional M -M experiments, 
which involves s ubtleties in the comparison of  two-way measure s of the phase velocity of light 
in orthogonal directions, the operation of the new Mach -Zehnder design is straightforward. A 
one-way comparison is made between a beam in vacuum and a beam with phase velocity 
reduced by the refractivity, Œµ = n ‚Äì 1, of the g aseous medium . A change, Œî c, in the vacuum 
speed of light would shift the interference fringe pattern by:  
 
ŒîùëÅ=ùêø
ùúÜùúÄŒîùëê
ùëê 
(4) 
Having a response which is first order in Œî c/c, the new instrument gain ed a large 
increase in sensitivity compared with the secon d order response of the Michelson . In the normal 
operating configuration  of the Mach -Zehnder interferometer , where light propagation in air 
was compared with vacuum, the minimum discernable signal was about 0.1 units of Œª/1000, 
corresponding to Œî cgas/cvac ‚âà 10‚Äì10, or Œî cgas ‚âà 0.03 m/s (note meters not kilometers per second). 
Compared  with the historical M -M experiments reporting fringe shift residuals which could be 
interpreted as translational velocities, v ‚âà 1 ‚Äì 10 km/s, th e modern benchtop design gains  5 
orders of magnitude in sensitivity to variation s in the phase velocity of light in gas.  
In Table 2, below, we calculate predicted signal amplitudes for the new instrument, 
under the assumptions of classical Galilean Relativity, LR and SR. As before, we p lace the 
observer  at rest  in a putative preferred frame, while  the instrument moves at relevant velocities .  
We begin by c onsidering the M ach-Zehnder  interferometer static  in the preferred fra me 
(Table 2, group 1). T he optical path length, 0.530 m, was traversed in the vacuum  reference 
pathway  at cvac ‚â° 299 792 458 m/s, in a time T0 = 1 767 889. 704 550 fs. The gas cell, containing  
air with refractive index, n = 1.000 273, was traversed  at cvac/n = 299 710 636.996 100 m/s, in  a time of  1 767 372.338  440 fs. The time difference,  482.633 889 fs, was the zero offset for 
measurements of fringe shift and represented about 272  wavelengths, matching  the shift in the 
fringe pattern as the reference cell was pumped down from atmospheric air to a hard vacuum . 
The shift in  effective optical path lengths was about 0.145 mm, well within  the coher ence 
length of the laser source .  
In groups 2 ‚Äì 5 of Table 2, we compare the one -way transit times for the light wavefront 
through the vacuum and air paths, assuming linear addition of velocities in the Galilean and 
Lorentzian interpretations. For ease of reading, transit times were expres sed as a difference 
from the time in vacuum at rest, T0. We note that in the moving interferometer, times change 
with rotation as the laser beam propagates in the direction of the instrument‚Äôs motion (denoted 
‚ÄúDownstream‚Äù), and then in the opposite directi on (denoted ‚ÄúUpstream‚Äù).

Predicted signal amplitudes are large in relation to those actually observed, e.g. Fig. 3 
and the previous report [Manley, 2024]. A typical signal would require a velocity some 3 orders 
of magnitude less than the CMB dipole (Table 2, group 5)  and similarly less than the velocities 
inferred from signals in historical M -M experiments interpreted according to LR . 
We note that Lorentz -Fitzgerald length contraction, predicted  under the assumptions of 
LR to cancel the signal in traditional M -M experiments with Michelson interferometers, is 
without noticeable effect on the new instrument , where the optical paths are parallel rather than 
orthogonal  (compare groups 2 & 3 of Table 2).  
SR, of course, predicts zero signal s in all M -M experiments . A trivial analysis p laces 
the observer stationary with respect to  the instrument . Since SR demands light propagation  be 
isotropic  in all frames of reference,  a zero frin ge shift  in M -M experiments  is implicit .  The analysis for an observer watching a moving instrument  under SR  is rather more 
instructive, however . As in the analysis of the Michelson interferometer, we cannot rely on the 
Fresnel drag equation, but must apply the (nonlinear) transformation of velocities between 
relatively moving frames to obtain the corre ct values for the phase velocities of light in the 
refractive medium  (Eq. 3). The difference between transit times in vacuum and air now match 
for the upstream and downstream directions, yielding a zero signal on rotation of the 
interferometer (Table 2, gr oup 6).  
In conclusion, we note that data from the new Mach -Zehnder instrument is in conflict 
with data from historical M -M experiments when interpreted under the assumptions of LR. 
Cosmic velocities deduced from signal amplitudes are 3 orders of magnitude  less than those 
inferred from historical data.  
 
4  Discussion  
 
The original conception of the Michelson -Morley experiment was formulated in the framework 
of classical physics. Linear addition of velocities  and constancy of lengths in relative motion , 
principles implicit in  the absolute  space  and time of  Newtonian physics and Galilean Relativity, 
were regarded as so elementary  and self -evident they were not even worthy of identification  as 
axiomatic assumptions underlying  the analysis  [Michelson &  Morley, 1887].  
The failure of rotating interferometers to demonstrate fringe shifts concordant with 
relevant cosmic  velocities, such as  the orbital speed of the Earth, was a crisis of paradigm -
shifting import. The first hint of the revolution in theoreti cal physics which was to culminate 
in Einstei n‚Äôs 1905 formulation of S R came in a short letter by G.F. FitzGerald  in 1889 , 
proposing  the contraction in length of moving objects [Fitzgerald, 1889].   
By 1892, H.A. Lorentz, a leading theoretician of the era, had formu lated the transforms  
for which he is now principally remembered . At the time of his lectures at Colombia University 
in 1906, Lorentz was convinced that the null result  of M -M experiments provided irrefutable 
proof  of the Lorentz -FitzGerald length contraction of moving objects  [Lorentz,  1904;  1916] . 
Rather than being merely the consequence  of a change in perspective due to relative motion, 
length contraction  was a real physical effect  according to Lorentz,  mediated by changes in  the 
behavior  of atomic electron s.  
Minkowski , meanwhile, was developing  Einstein‚Äôs ideas into the full mathematical 
machinery of  electromagnetism  in relativistic space -time [Minkowski, 1908 ]. Einstein initially 
characterized  this elaboration  as ‚Äú√ºberfl√ºssige Gelehrsamkeit ‚Äù ‚Äì usually given a tactful 
translation as ‚Äúsuperfluous erudition,‚Äù but perhaps more accurately  rendered as  ‚Äúoverflowing 
learnedness .‚Äù  
In today‚Äôs world , the debates on  the foundations of relativity theory during the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries are all but forgotten, of more interest to historians than physicists. SR 
provides an entirely consistent system for the transformation of measurements between inertial 
frames in relative motion  without acceleration or gravity . Refinements of M -M experiments  
testing Local Lorentz Invariance  to higher and higher precision  are no longer  motivated by  any 
doubts about the validity of SR, but instead by  the prospect of quantum gravity phenomena 
expected in the Planck regime  leaving  subtle hints in a technologically  accessible  domain  
[Eichhorn,  Platania & Schiffer,  2020].  
An unresolved  issue from the historical era concerns the  small anomalous signals in M -
M experiments with gas -filled interferom eters . In 1955,  Shankland  and colleagues  published a 
frequently -cited reanalysis of Miller‚Äôs extensive data from the 1920s , attributing the signals to 
thermal fluctuations and gradients  [Shankland et al . 1955].  The widespread acceptance of 
Shankland‚Äôs work represented a collective sigh of relief  from the physics community  that a 
nagging issue in the foundations of SR could be laid to rest. A detailed reading of the paper, 
however, raises  doubts of which no hint is to be found in the abstract.  The only certain 
conclusion we can draw  from the comparison of historical and modern M -M experiments is 
that gas in the optical pathways  of interferometers  was problematic.  In the 21st century, Reginald Cahill in Australia and Maurizio Consoli in Italy advanced 
novel  proposals whereby the reduced phase velocity of light in the gas -filled optical pathways 
of historical M -M experiments  might  have confer red sensitivity to motion against a preferred 
frame of reference  [Cahill & Kitto, 2002; Consoli & Costanzo, 2003] . The miniscule 
refractivity of atmospheric air, Œµ = n ‚Äì 1 ‚âà 3 ‚àô 10‚Äì4, indicated  that fringe shift signals would be 
orders of magnitude smaller than  na√Øve  predictions  based on classical physics  and thus  would 
be consistent with the traditional picture of M -M expe riments yielding null results.  Under the 
new paradigm however, the se small  signal amplitudes bec ame concordant with  relevant cosmic  
velocities, such as the motion of the solar system against the CMB ( v ‚âà 370  km/s) or against 
the rotating disk of our Milky Way galaxy ( v ‚âà 220 km /s).  
Considerable effort has been  expended in  reanalysis of historical records . The picture 
that has emerged is at best  consistent  with the  new hypothesis , rather than compelling . The 
limitation in such analyses was the poor  quality of the original data,  which recorded  signals 
close to the limit s of detection.   
The development of a novel  M-M experiment, using a Mach -Zehnder interferometer to 
test light propagation in gas against a vacuum reference, now provides interpretative clarity 
[Manley, 2023, 2024].  Rather than the two -way measurement of light propagation in the 
Michelson interferometer, t he new instrument  compares one -way phase velocities , gaining 
orders of magnitude  in sensitivity to  anomalous propagation of light in gas . Translational 
speeds against a preferred frame of reference must be at least 3 orders of magnitude less than 
relevant cosmic velocities to predict  the signal amplitudes typical of  the modern instrument.  
Thus we reject, with high confidence, the LR interpr etation of M -M experiments  where 
sensitivity to motion against a preferred frame of reference is conferred by a refractive medium 
reducing the phase velocity of light in the optical pathways .  
It is instructive to dissect the characteristics of SR which , in contrast with the 
predictions of classical physics, conspire to yield a null result in  M-M experiments. I n an 
inertial observer‚Äôs view of a relatively moving inertial frame,  SR predicts contraction of  
length s, slowing of clocks , disruption of  simultaneity and  the nonlinear addition of velocities . 
In vacuum, only the Lorentz -Fitzgerald length contraction is needed to predict a null result 
from  M-M experiments. With a refractive medium in the optical pathways, nonlinear addition 
of velocities is  also required for the  null.  
The rejection of the LR interpretation of M -M experiments leaves us  with an unresolved 
question. What is the significance of the non -zero signals in historical M -M experiments and 
the‚Äîsmall  but still non -zero‚Äîsignals in our mo dern experiment?  
Straightforward kinematic interpretations must be  ruled out. The critical factor in the 
comparison of Michelson interferometers with the new Mach -Zehnder instrument is the two -
way versus one -way measure ment  of light speed. With the two -way measure, gains and losses 
of speed caused by motion against a preferred frame would  cancel to first order, leaving only 
a second order response , with a drastic reduction in sensitivity .  
If we postulate  that the Michelson and Mach -Zehnder  instruments  are actually ‚Äîdespite 
appearance s‚Äîresponding to the same  physical  phenomenon, then the mechanism affecting  
light propagation would have to  avoid the cancellation of gains and losses  of speed  inherent in 
the two -way measure. This  demands that the effect be non -directional ( or omnidirectional), 
ruling out kinematics, but perhaps opening the door to another idea.   
A minute temperature fluctuation of the gas in the optical pathways could alter light 
speed, changing density and theref ore refractivity at constant pressure. Unlike a kinematic 
mechanism, this effect would avoid the  first order  cancellation inherent in two -way measures.  
In a careful analysis  of 6 historical M -M experiments , Consoli and Pluchino  proposed 
a the rmal effect of non -local origin, providing a plausible explanation for  the signals and their 
reduced magnitude when helium  (n ‚âà 1.000 030)  replaced atmospheric air  (n ‚âà 1.000 290)  in 
the optical paths  [Consoli & Pluchino, 2018a]. The temperature difference  between the gas in 
orthogonal limbs of Michelson interferometers required to impose the requisite difference in 
phase velocities was 0.26 ÔÇ± 0.06 ( n = 6) mK. In this interpretation,  the Michelson interferometer is vastly  more sensitive to changes in the phase velocity of light  than usually inferred . Miller‚Äôs 
1933 data, instead of implying Œîc/c ‚âà 3 ‚àô 10‚Äì5, would signify Œîc/c ‚âà 2.5 ‚àô 10‚Äì10 [Manley, 2024 ].  
In our modern Mach -Zehnder instrument, a thermal cycle of 0.26 mK wo uld yield an 
amplitude of 0.25 in units of Œª/1000, matching  our observed  signals, as in Fig. 3 and the 
previous report [ Manley, 2024].  The concordance of the new observations with historical data 
under the thermal proposal stands in sharp contrast with the  severe conflict under kinematic 
analysis .  
The mechanism of such a t hermal cycle remains a matter of conjecture . The suggestion 
of a non -local coupling to the CMB dipole  through the quantum mechanical vacuum  [Consoli 
& Pluchino, 2018a]  requires  development of theory before it can yield a quantitative prediction 
of amplitudes.  
Daily and seasonal cycles in the amplitude of signals from the new Mach -Zehnder 
interferometer were consistent with  a celestial vector matching the predicted Dark Matter w ind, 
rather than the CMB dipole [Manley, 2024].  This suggest ed a mechanism involving i nteraction 
with a field of movi ng particles having a low cross -section for interaction with baryonic matter , 
such as axions , which are currently regarded as plausible  candidates for Dark Matter  [Chadha -
Day, Ellis &  Marsh, 2022 ]. How such an interaction might confer the directional sensitivity 
implicit in the generation of a signal in rotating interferometers is not immediately obvious.  
 
5  Conclusion s 
 
Data from a novel Michelson -Morley experiment with a rotating Mach -Zehnder interferometer 
comparing the phase velocity of light in air and vacuum is inconsistent with  the Lorentzian 
interpretation  of historical Michelson -Morley experiments , in which  signal  residuals  were 
postulated to  reveal motion against a preferred frame of reference. The conflict is 3 orders of 
magnitude in velocities inferred under kinematic assumptions.  An alternative explanation is 
plausible: a  fractional millikelvin cycle in the tem perature of gas in the optical pathways during 
rotation of interferometers would account quantitatively for signals in the current  work  and the 
historical records. The mechanism driving such a thermal cycle is presently unknown: tempting 
speculations include a  non-local coupling through the quantum mechanical vacuum  to a cosmic 
vector or an interaction of gas with moving particles in the Dark Matter halo of our Milky Way 
galaxy.
