Main body of paper:  
A hypothesis  of three kinds of graviton interactions  with matter , 
spacetime  and other gravitons . 
Assumptions:  
Space is digital. It is composed of spin networks , according to Loop Quantum 
Gravity theory.  Ref. 1  I call spin net works: pixels.  
Pixels can be  created and destroyed.  
Spacetime is constantly being created  and destroyed . 
Around black holes , pixels are destroyed faster than light can interact with pixels.  
Gravitons exist and do interact with other quantum fields  and with each other.  
Each of the three kinds of gravity are active at all scales, but only one of them is 
predominant  at its scale.  The predominant gravity may be positive  (attracting ), or 
negative  (repulsing ). 
The cumulative effects of the three kinds  of gravity are what cosmologists o bserv e 
in the distribution of stars, galaxies, and large structures in the Universe.  
 
The first kind  of gravity  that we are familiar with is “Newtonian Gravity” . It is  
gravity  we experience on Earth and in the Solar System. It is quantified by 
Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation. The effect of this type of gravity decreases 
rapidly with distance.  
On the quantum level: When a  graviton interacts with baryonic matter , such as a 
proton or neutron , a spacetime pixel is deleted , resulting in negative pressure 
between two stars.  We experience it as a positive gravity , which keeps us down on earth  and keeps the Earth circling around the Sun.  The energy liberated  when a 
pixel is deleted  is transferred a s kinetic energy of the baryonic matter.  
On the quantum level , all action is local, that is , pixels are deleted at the Earth and 
the Sun; there is no  curvature of spac e. Pixels are not removed where there are 
not protons or neutrons . There is no pixel removal or bending of space when the 
Earth is not at that location.  It is the removal of pixels  over time and position that  
results in  spacetime to “bend ” in the mathematics of general relativity.   
The force between bodies of matter according to  Newton  is: 
𝐹=𝐺𝑀𝑚
𝑟2 
F is the force in Newtons  between  two bodies of matter, such as Earth and Sun   
G is the universal constant of gravitation: = 6.674  x 10-11N-m2/kg2 Ref. 7  
M and m are the respective masses in kg  
r is the distance between their centers  in meters  
Since this is an inverse square law, its effect  rapidly decreases . Above half a light 
year  distance between two stars , Modified Newtonian Gravity  MOND  dominates.   
The second kind  of gravity  is dominant on galactic scales . This gravity is currently  
hypothesized to be due to dark matter. There are other hypotheses , such as 
Modified Ne wtonian Dynamics  by M. Milgrom  Ref. 5 ; modification  of an equation 
of General Relativity at galactic scales  proposed by professor A . Deur , at the 
University of Virginia  Ref. 6 . 
My hypothesis is the slight bending of geodesics toward  the line of center  
between  any two stars.  Please read my paper on viXra. org viXra:2108 .0141 . Ref. 2 
On the quantum level: when two gravitons interact in antiparallel  streams 
between two stars , near ly parallel  and counter -streaming , the spin network is 
moved slightly towards the line of center between these two stars.  This results in 
a slight bending of the geodesics toward the disk of the star. More gravitons will 
be exchanged at the sta r, resulting in an increased gravitational attraction.  
The proposed  second kind of gravity holds  the stars in  the local galaxies together , 
by what I call  “gravitational strings ”. Although gra vity due to a string  between two stars is small , its total effect is huge . These gravitational strings are between each 
star and all other stars, resulting in a very dense network of gravitational strings.  
Assuming  at least 100 billion stars in the Milkey Way galaxy , the calculated 
number of gravitational strings is  (n-1)*(n/2), which is ½ (n2 – n), which is about 
5*1021 strings .  
I posit that a ntipar allel streams of gravitons  act the same as antiparallel streams of 
light . They very slightly attract each other . Paper s to read are Tolman, Ehrenfest , 
and Podolsky . Ref. 3 and “The gravitational interaction of light : from weak to 
strong fields ” by Faraoni V., and Dumse R.M.  Ref. 4 on arXiv.org  
Gravity  between two stars  on a galactic scale  is given by : 
(Keep in mind that Newton’s contribution of gravity rapidly decreases . At Alpha 
Leonis, 79 light years from the Sun , the contribution of Newtonian gravity 
between our Sun and th is star is only  0.002745 of the total gravity.)

from star f.  
G = the gravitational constant G = 6.67 x10-11 N·m2/kg2 Ref. 7  
a0 about  1.2 +/ - 0.2 x 10-10 m/s2 estimated by M. Milgrom     Ref. 8 
 
The third kind of gravity  is at the scale of the Universe. Here gravity is negative.  
This is currently attributed to dark energy.  It is expressed by Hubble’s Law . Let’s 
call it “ Negative Gravity ”. 
Pixels are constantly being created and destroyed . A predominant flow of 
gravitons , results in positive  gravity , Newtonian and Mondian . This results in 
negative  entropy , which is more than balanced by Negative gravity , thereby not 
violating the second law of thermodynamics.  
There is very little  order due to gravity in  the vast spacetime beyond  galaxy  
cluster s. When two gravitons interact  at larger angles , not near parallel,  due to the 
small size of  gravitons, the interaction  is extremely infrequent . But when two gravitons do interact, a  pixel of spacetime is created , thus spacetime is expanding . 
The energy used to create a pixel comes from the electromagnetic field. The result 
is the measured by the Hubble Constant.  
Hubble -Lemaitre Law:  
v = H0D 
v = speed of separation  
H0 = Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc; A galaxy  1 megaparsec away ( 3.09 x 1019 km) 
will move away at 70 km/s.  
D = proper distance to galaxy  
The Hubble constant can also be stated as a relative rate of expansion , at H 0 = 
7%/Gyr . Which means  that at the current rate of expansion it takes  one billion 
years for an unbound structure  to grow by 7%.  
In gravitationally bound structures, such as our Milky Way , negative gravity has no 
meaning , since it is held together by the second kind o f gravity , the gravitational 
strings between stars . It’s expansion due to negative gravity  is very,  very small , 
only 0.00187% in a billion years . Its diameter is 26.8 kpc. (1,000/ 26.8  = 37.3 ; 
0.07/37.3  = 0.00187% ) 
At the Big Bang, the density of gravitons was extremely high , therefore spacetime 
was created  in an extremely short time . As the density and temperature 
decreased, the ex pansion slowed . This was called the inflationary field . What is 
now called dark energy is a continuation of the inflationary field at the beginning 
of the Universe’s expansion.  Now the expansion  is much, much slower . 
As matter condensed , positive gravity of the graviton -baryonic matter interaction 
further slowed down  the expansion of the Universe.  
As the distances between galactic  clusters increased, the effect of negative  gravity 
increased again. We are now in this phase of  the expansion of the Universe.   
The very large structures show the history of expansion in the Universe.  
 
 Conclusion:  
Predominant ly ordered flows of gravitons  result in  positive gravities, called 
Newtonian Gravity and M odified Newtonian Dynamics .  
Negative gravity, currently called  Dark Energy, is the result of the random creation 
of pixel s of spac e in the vast expanses of the Universe.

Abstract:  The interaction of light beams in linearized general relativity is also 
revisited and clarified, a new result is obtained for photon -to-photon attraction, 
and a conjecture is proved. Given equal energy density in the beams, the light -to-
light attraction is twice the matter -to-light attraction and four times the matter -to-
matter attraction.
