Abstract
Acoustic waves are the result of molecules colliding and fluctuating. However, the relationship between
acoustic wave speed and molecular collision speed has not been directly formulated and validated as a
function of kinetic properties in terms of the translational and rotational kinetic energies. This article will
present and validate a formula that connects acoustic wave speed and molecular collision speed with the
translational and rotational kinetic energies of molecules. This formula not only provides insight into the
microscopic mechanisms of acoustic waves but can also be used to determine acoustic wave speed from
mechanic analyses such as collision simulations of particles.
Keywords:  acoustic wave speed, molecular collision speed, the ratio of heat capacity, heat capacity at
constant pressure, heat capacity at constant volume, kinetic theory of gases, kinetic energy.
Introduction
Acoustic waves are the result of molecules colliding and fluctuating [1,2]. However, the relationship between
acoustic wave speed and molecular collision speed has not been directly formulated and validated as a
function of kinetic properties in terms of the translational and rotational kinetic energies of molecules. The
author1 and his co-authors have documented a formula for this purpose in a published lecture notes [3]
without a self-contained proof of this formula. In this article, this formula will be derived in detail based only
on mechanical properties.
The relationship between molecular collision speed ( 𝑣) and acoustic wave speed ( 𝑐) is typically formulated as
[2]
𝑐2=𝛾
3𝑣2(1)
Where 𝛾 is the ratio of heat capacity [1,4] defined as the ratio of the heat capacity at constant pressure ( 𝐶𝑃) to
the heat capacity at constant volume ( 𝐶𝑉) as
𝛾≡𝐶𝑃
𝐶𝑉(2)
The ratios of heat capacity ( 𝛾) for different molecules are obtained experimentally. Kinetic energies, in terms
of the translational and rotational kinetic energies, are not shown explicitly in the formulas.We propose a new formula for the ratio of heat capacity that relates the molecular collision speed ( 𝑣) with the
acoustic wave speed ( 𝑐) as
𝛾=3𝛼+2
3𝛼(3)
where 𝛼 is a new variable defined as the ratio of total kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟) to translational kinetic ( 𝐸𝑟)
energy as
𝛼≡𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟
𝐸𝑡(4)
Where 𝐸𝑡 is the translational kinetic energy, 𝐸𝑟 is the rotational (spin) kinetic energy, and 𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟 is the total
kinetic energy.
From the new proposed ratio of heat capacity formula (Eq.3), the relationship between the molecular collision
speed ( 𝑣) and the acoustic wave speed ( 𝑐) is affected by the ratio of kinetic energies in terms of the new
variable 𝛼 as shown in Eq.1.
The resulting formula from combining the above three equations (Eqs.1,3,4) connects acoustic wave speed
and molecular collision speed with the translational and rotational kinetic energies of molecules. This formula
provides insight into the microscopic mechanisms of acoustic waves.  In a practical sense, the wave speed can
be determined from mechanic analyses such as collision simulations of particles.
This new proposed formula (Eq.3) with the new variable 𝛼 (Eq.4) will be derived as following: First, we will
derive the equation of state which is defined with the new variable 𝛼. Second, we will derive the acoustic
wave equation using equation of state with the new variable 𝛼. Third, we will derive the formula (Eq.1) that
relates the molecular collision speed ( 𝑣) to the wave propagation speed ( 𝑐).
Three Governing Equations
To derive the acoustic wave equation, three governing equations are required: the equation of state, Euler’s
force equation, and the equation of continuity. These three governing equations connect three physical
properties: pressure ( 𝑃), collision velocity ( 𝑣), and density ( 𝜌) as shown in the figure below.

Figure 1. Three Governing Equations
The equation of state will be derived in detail using the new formula for the ratio of heat capacity ( 𝛾). Euler’s
force equation and the equation of continuity will be briefly derived as they are well documented in literature.Equation of State
To setup the derivation of the equation of state, three equations (Eqs. 5-7) based on the kinetic theory are
listed below for reference:
𝐸𝑡=1
2𝑛𝑁 𝐴𝑚𝑣2(5)
𝐸𝑟=1
2𝑛𝑁 𝐴𝐼𝜔2(6)
𝑃𝑉=1
3𝑛𝑁 𝐴𝑚𝑣2(7)
where 𝐸𝑡 is the translational kinetic energy, 𝐸𝑟 is the rotational kinetic energy, 𝑛 is the number of moles, 𝑁𝐴 is
Avogadro’s number, 𝑚 is the mass of one molecule, 𝐼 is the mass moment of inertia of one molecule, 𝑣 is the
translational velocity, 𝜔 is the angular velocity, 𝑃 is the pressure, and 𝑉 is the volume.
Combining Eqs.5 and 7, the translational kinetic energy 𝐸𝑡 can be related to the pressure 𝑃 as
𝐸𝑡=3
2𝑃𝑉 (8)
This equation (Eq.8) shows that at a fixed volume ( 𝑉), pressure ( 𝑃) is only related to the translational kinetic
energy ( 𝐸𝑡) and is not related to the rotational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑟). This is an important property for the kinetic
theory of gases which will be used to develop the formula for the equation of state as following.

Figure 2. Adiabatic Process
The equation of state in terms of the translational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑡) and the rotational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑟) is
derived as following. In an adiabatic process, according to the conservation of energy, if there is no energy
input ( ∆𝑄=0), the summation of the change in internal kinetic energy ( ∆𝐸𝑡+∆𝐸𝑟) and the work done
(𝑃∆𝑉) is equal to zero as
∆(𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟)+𝑃∆𝑉=0 (9)
Since pressure ( 𝑃) is only related to the translational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑡) and not to the rotational kinetic
energy ( 𝐸𝑟) as shown in Eq.8, we want to represent the total kinetic energy increase ( ∆𝐸𝑡+∆𝐸𝑟) with the
translational kinetic energy increase ( 𝐸𝑡). This is accomplished by introducing a new variable 𝛼 defined as the
ratio of the total kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟)  to the translational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑡) as
𝛼≡𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟
𝐸𝑡(10)
Substituting Eq.10 into Eq.9 gives∆(𝛼𝐸 𝑡)+𝑃∆𝑉=0 (11)
Substituting Eq.8 into the above equation (Eq 11) gives

Taking the derivative of 𝑃𝑉 gives

The Euler’s Force Equation
The Euler’s force equation can be derived from Newton’s second law of motion. According to Newton’s Law
of Motion, the force 𝑓⃗ applied on the cubic will cause an acceleration 𝑎⃗ on this cubic with three-dimensional
lengths of ∆𝑥,∆𝑦,𝑎𝑛𝑑  ∆𝑧. The free body diagram of the cubic is shown in the figure below.∆𝑦

Where 𝑝≡𝑃−𝑃𝑜 and 𝑃≅𝑃𝑜. Here 𝑃 is the instantaneous pressure and 𝑃𝑜 is the averaged pressure which
can be treated as a constant. Based on this, Eq.16 can be rewritten as
𝑃−𝑃 𝑜
𝑃𝑜=𝛾𝜌−𝜌 𝑜
𝜌𝑜(20)
Note that 𝜌 is the instantaneous density and 𝜌𝑜 is the averaged density and can be treated as a constant.
Equation of Continuity
The equation of continuity can be derived from the law of conservation of mass. According to the law of
conservation of mass, the increase of mass in the cubic unit is equal to the “mass flow in” minus “mass flow
out”, as shown in the figure below:

Figure 6. Derivation of the Acoustic Wave Equation
The relationship between the wave propagation speed ( 𝑐) and the molecular collision speed ( 𝑣) can be
obtained by replacing the pressure ( 𝑃𝑜) with1
3𝑉𝑛𝑁 𝐴𝑚𝑣2 as shown in Eq.7 and replacing density ( 𝜌𝑜) with
𝑛𝑁 𝐴𝑚
𝑉 as
𝑐2=𝛾𝑃𝑜
𝜌𝑜=𝛾1
3𝑉𝑛𝑁𝐴𝑚𝑣2
𝑛𝑁𝐴𝑚
𝑉=𝛾
3𝑣2(26)
Where 𝛾 is the ratio of heat capacity defined as
𝛾=3𝛼+2
3𝛼(27)where 𝛼 is the new variable defined as the ratio of total kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟) to translational kinetic ( 𝐸𝑟)
energy as
𝛼≡𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟
𝐸𝑡(28)
Where 𝐸𝑡 is the translational kinetic energy, 𝐸𝑟 is the rotational kinetic energy, and 𝐸𝑡+𝐸𝑟 is the total kinetic
energy.
The relationship between acoustic wave speed and molecular collision speed (Eqs.1 or 26) is now validated
with the translational and rotational kinetic energies of molecules (Eqs.5 and 6). The relationship between
acoustic wave speed and molecular collision speed is affected by the kinetic energies as following: when the
rotational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑟) is very small relative to the translational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑡), the ratio of heat
capacity ( 𝛾) will be close to 5/3 and the acoustic wave speed ( 𝑐) will be close to the molecular collision speed
(𝑣) multiplied by ට5
9 as shown in Eq.26. On the other hand, when the rotational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑟) is very
large relative to the translational kinetic energy ( 𝐸𝑡), the ratio of heat capacity ( 𝛾) will be close to 1 and the
acoustic wave speed ( 𝑐) will be close to the molecular collision speed ( 𝑣) multiplied by ට1
3. By comparing
these two extreme cases, if the molecular collision speed ( 𝑣) is fixed, the acoustic wave speed ( 𝑐) is faster in
particles with smaller rotational energies and slower in particle with larger rotational energies. This can be
explained by the derivation that rotational energy absorbs part of the kinetic energy and hence slows down the
acoustic wave speed.
Conclusion
A formula that connects acoustic wave speed and molecular collision speed with kinetic properties in terms of
the translational and rotational kinetic energies is presented and validated based only on kinetic properties.
This formula not only provides insight into the acoustic microscopic mechanisms of acoustic waves but also
can be used to determine the wave speed from the mechanic analysis such as the numerical collision
simulation of particles.
