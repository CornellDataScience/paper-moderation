Abstract  
 We have defined intrinsic vacuum  space as a physical space devoid of 
any particle of matter and radiation [1]. We  want to  show here that it 
is possible to solve the problem of  discontinuity in  the measurements 
of Hubble  constant  (H) [2] by evaluating the difference between its 
presumed value in this hypothetical space , measured  by the analysis 
of the cosmic microwave background , and that presumed in real 
vacuum  space measured by the red-shift  and distance . 
 
Introduction  
 The expansion of the universe is a well -accepted notion, but its 
measurement by the Hubble constant  (H), which states that the 
speed of movement of galaxies is proportional to their distance, 
presents many difficulties and it is only since a bout  twenty years that 
we have had results relatively precise [3],[4].                                        
Traditional measure ments  are based on the “red -shift” of selected 
objects for the best knowledge  that we have on their  distance 
(Cepheids, Supernovea ). The main measurement , here , is the analysis 
of the light of the sources ; the value of 72 km/s /Megaparsec is 
usually retained but with uncertainty of around 5% .                                                                            
It was also shown that the expansion is accelerating [5].                                                                        
The major event of modern cosmology is undoubtedly the analysis of 
the diffuse background cosmology following the Planck mission and 
whose Results were published in 2015 [6].  Among them a precise 
value of the Hubble constant of 67.5 km/s/Megaparsec with only 1% 
of uncertainty was obtained. The gap with above value  is the cause of the problem of the  Hubble  constant .  
 
1) Search for a solution  
 We started by analyzing the differences physical measurements 
between traditional measurements and those of diffuse background: 
the first are based on the properties of the light emitted by the stars, 
the fossil radiation is completely ignored there. On t he contrary, this 
is the central element taken into account by Planck analysis  !            
This analysis is based on spatial variations in density of this  radiation 
at a very remote time, which gave us makes one think that, for doing 
it, it was necessary to locate oneself in a reference frame free from 
this radiation, hence the idea to use the concept of Intrinsic Vaccum  
Space that we defined as such in a previous publication [1].  
  
2) Relationship between the Hubble constant and the fine  structure 
constant (alpha)  
 This relationship is totally ignored by  consensual  Physics but it is 
included in all of the work that we have carried out, see in particular : 
[7], the analysis of the angular momentum of the electron lead  us to 
establish the relationship:  1/alpha = Log (R/lo)  where lo is the 
graviton  amplitude , equivalent to the Planck length and R the range 
of the gravitational field or radius  of the material universe.                 
Furthermore, the Hubble constant is defined by the differential 
relation   dL/L = Hdt, the integration of the function L from lo to R 
provides the relation: Log(R/lo) = H T+ C where C is a constant and T 
the age of the universe.   So there comes the very simple relationship 
1/alpha = H T + C  
 
 
 3) Application to the Hubble problem  
 We consider here that the Hubble constants are  slightly  different 
between Real Space and Intrinsic Space.  We attribute traditional 
measurements (red -shift) to Real Space and Planck's measurements 
to Intrinsic Space  for the reasons given in paragraph 1.                                 
By settin g omega = 1/alpha, we establish the relationship:  
(omega 1 – omega 2) = T (H1 - H2) where the indices 1 and 2 are 
assigned respectively to Real and Intrinsic Spaces .                                         
We carry out the digital application on the data following 
experiments:                                                                                                       
*H1 between 70 and 74 km/s/Megaparsec, i.e. between 2.14 and 
2.65 10^ -18/s  
*H2 between 67 and 68 km/s/Megaparsec, i.e. between 2.05 and 
2.09 10^ -18/s                                                                                                          
*T = 13.8 10^9 Light Year = 4.35 10^17 s                                                       
*Omega1 = 137.036                                                                                               
We find  omega 2   between 136.80 and 137.01 (maximum range) , this 
interval contains, in a close manner, the integer value 137 obtained 
by the relationship between the  mass of the electron and the physical 
constants of Intrinsic Vacuum Space [1].                                                       
We can therefore say that this concept probably brings a light, see a 
solution , to the Hubble problem.                                                                 
Finally, it seems important to us to highlight the work theory of 
Freedman and his team who consider th at the minimal  value                                             
H = 70km/s/Megaparsec  would be  due to consistency with other 
cosmological values [8].                                                                                                               
In this case, we obtain  omega between 136.99 and 137.01 (!).                     
We also think that traditional measure ments  could  present an error 
factor towards high values of H which would be linked to a large 
quantum density of radiation , greater than that of fossil radiation 
around the source, which is an obviously variable parameter  , the Freedman value would then be the value where the fossil radiation is 
very prevalent around the source analyzed.  
  
Conclusion  
The notion of Intrinsic Empty Space is able to solve the problem of 
the Hubble constant if we  consider that fossil radiations influence it 
value.  Being able to confirm the whole number 137  (the inverse of 
the fine structure constant in Intrinsic space) , is the best indication 
and also an important result  .  
Let us remember that this space is the physical space which contain 
only the energy of the fundamental level associated with gravitational 
energy.  In this logic, the project of measuring H by the use of 
gravitational waves [9] should provide a consistent value  with that of 
the analysis of the Planck mission.
