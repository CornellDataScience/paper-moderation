The Final Theory 
Dimosthenis Michopoulos 
Abstract 
This paper presents the theory of Material Pulses, a radical approach aimed at the complete 
unification of physical interactions, from classica l physics to quantum mechanics. The 
material pulse is introduced as the fundamental ent ity, describing the structure of matter and 
energy through distributions of charge and energy. The theory aims to explain phenomena 
that are traditionally interpreted through abstract  concepts, such as spin, which is redefined 
as a consequence of the internal dynamics of pulses  rather than an independent property. 
Using minimal coupling, the theory describes the in teractions of material pulses with external 
fields, leading to a natural emergence of both elec tromagnetic and gravitational phenomena. 
Experimental proposals are presented that could val idate this theoretical approach, such as 
modified Stern-Gerlach experiments and pulse scatte ring experiments. 
The theory of Material Pulses offers a unified pers pective for understanding physical laws, 
proposing a simplified and coherent interpretation that can unify classical and quantum 
physics, ultimately leading to a Final Theory of ph ysical interactions.

Introduction  
1.  Introduction and Theoretical Framework 
The unification of physics represents one of the mo st ambitious goals of science, yet it 
remains an unsolved issue due to the inability of e xisting theories to provide a unified 
description of the universe. From the birth of clas sical mechanics by Newton, the formulation 
of general relativity by Einstein, to the developme nt of quantum mechanics by Bohr and 
Heisenberg [ 4, 15 ], efforts to understand nature have always been di vided. Today, the theory 
of general relativity [ 4] successfully describes gravity and the curvature of spacetime, while 
quantum theory [ 12 ] describes phenomena on microscopic scales. Howeve r, these two 
theories do not easily unify, and attempts to unify  them through Quantum Field Theory 
(QFT) are considered inadequate and problematic due  to the need for renormalization, a non-
physical mathematical process that does not corresp ond to physical reality [ 14 ]. 
The theory of Material Pulses comes to propose an a lternative approach that rejects 
the renormalization techniques of QFT, as well as t he foundation of the strong and weak 
nuclear forces as independent interactions [ 11]. The material pulse is introduced as the 
fundamental entity that describes both matter parti cles and their interactions, while also 
providing a natural and coherent interpretation for  phenomena that are traditionally 
described through abstract properties. All particle s are considered as material pulses, i.e., 
dynamic configurations of space and energy. This ap proach allows for the unification of 
classical and quantum theories without relying on a bstract, difficult-to-understand processes 
[9]. 
Unlike QFT, which imposes the existence of external  fields and additional 
mechanisms [ 17 ], material pulses are intrinsically linked to the space in which they exist. 
Their form depends on their interaction with the en vironment, leading to a more natural 
interpretation of the emergence of forces like grav ity and electromagnetic interactions [ 6, 7]. Gravity, for example, is not described as a separat e field but as the curvature of space caused 
by the concentration of material pulses [ 4]. 
The theory of Material Pulses also proposes a reint erpretation of spin, which is not an 
independent fundamental property but arises from th e internal distribution of charge and the 
motion of the pulses [ 10 ]. This provides a more intuitive understanding, re jecting abstract 
properties that are difficult to correlate with phy sical processes [ 18 ]. 
Finally, quantum mechanics in this theory is presen ted through a more causal 
interpretation [ 16 ], where material pulses clearly determine the stat es of particles. The 
interaction with external fields is described throu gh the principle of minimal coupling [ 19 ], 
maintaining minimal action without relying on rando mness or probabilistic processes [ 13 ]. 
This causal interpretation provides a holistic and coherent picture of how matter and energy 
interact in the universe. 
In summary, the theory of Material Pulses seeks to bridge the gap between general 
relativity and quantum mechanics, offering a cohere nt description that rejects the flaws of 
older theories like QFT [ 14 ]. By adopting the material pulse as the fundamenta l entity, a new 
approach is achieved that combines classical and qu antum interactions in a natural and 
causal manner. 
2.  Fundamental Principles and Axioms of the Theory of Material Pulses  
The theory of Material Pulses is based on fundament al principles and axioms that 
establish its framework, providing a coherent and u nified understanding of physical 
phenomena. This section presents the main axioms th at form the foundation of the theory. 
Principle of Least Action  
At the core of the theory lies the Principle of Least Action , one of the most 
fundamental principles in physics, which states tha t the motion of systems chooses the path 
of least possible "action" (action being a quantity  related to energy and time). This principle is 
grounded in the work of Emmy Noether , who demonstrated that symmetries in nature are 
linked to conservation laws, such as the conservati on of energy and momentum [ 19 ]. In the 
theory of Material Pulses, this principle is crucia l for describing the dynamics of the pulses, 
determining their trajectory in spacetime and their  interactions with fields so that the total 
action is minimized [ 9]. In this way, both the motion and interactions of  the material pulses 
are governed by this principle, providing a natural  foundation for the evolution of systems. 
 Material Pulse as a Fundamental Entity  
The theory introduces the material pulse  as the fundamental entity of nature, 
offering a different perspective from traditional p article theories. Instead of point-like or 
wave-like entities, particles are described as puls es—configurations of space and energy with 
dynamic properties. This perspective is reminiscent  of Einstein's  view of spacetime curvature 
due to mass, where matter and field are inextricabl y linked [4]. Material pulses thus serve as 
the basis for describing all known elementary parti cles, as well as their interactions. 
 Interdependence of Pulses and Fields  
A fundamental axiom of the theory is that there is no separation between particles 
and fields. Material pulses are inseparably connect ed with the fields that surround them and 
which affect and are affected by them. This interde pendence recalls the work of Maxwell  
(1865) on the interaction of electromagnetic fields  with charges and masses [ 7]. This 
interdependence eliminates the need for independent  descriptions of "particles" and "fields" 
and provides a coherent view where the material pul se and the field are facets of the same 
physical entity. 
 Charge and Spin as Emergent Properties  
The theory of Material Pulses reinterprets properti es such as charge  and spin  as 
emergent consequences of the internal structure and  dynamics of pulses. Charge  remains a fundamental property within the theory, but it now arises from asymmetry in the 
distribution of the material pulse . Thus, the existence and quantization of charge ar e 
explained as a result of the specific internal conf iguration of the pulse, rather than as an 
inherent attribute. On the other hand, spin  is no longer retained as an independent quantum 
property but is instead interpreted as the result o f rotational and internal movements  of 
charges within the pulse [ 1]. Hence, spin becomes a natural consequence of the  internal 
motion of the pulse rather than an external, abstra ct property introduced artificially. 
 Interactions through Minimal Coupling  
The interactions of material pulses with external f ields are described through the 
principle of minimal coupling , which ensures that action remains minimal during 
interactions. This principle is reminiscent of the approach taken by Feynman  (1949) in 
describing particle interactions through the use of  minimal energies [ 5]. Additionally, the 
work of Yang and Mills  (1954) on the interaction of particles via field s ymmetries strengthens 
the understanding of minimal coupling [ 6]. 
Emergence of Forces from Pulse Dynamics 
In this theory, forces such as gravitational  and electromagnetic  are not independent 
entities. Instead, they emerge from the internal dynamics of the pulse  and its response to the 
fields surrounding it. Gravity can be described as the result of spacetime curvature  due to the 
presence of material pulses, as described by Einstein  [4]. Electromagnetic force, on the other 
hand, is linked to electromagnetic interactions  as presented in the work of Jackson  (1999) 
[18 ]. 
 Rejection of Renormalization and Revision of Funda mental Forces  
Finally, the theory rejects the process of renormalization , considering it an artificial 
method without a physical basis. Dyson's  (1952) discussion of the difficulties and doubts 
regarding renormalization in quantum field theories  supports this approach [ 14 ]. 
Additionally, the theory revises strong and weak nu clear forces, which are no longer 
regarded as fundamental but instead emerge as prope rties of the internal dynamics of pulses, 
something that can be associated with the Bohm  (1952) causal interpretation of quantum 
phenomena [ 20 ]. 
 
Theoretical Background  
3.  Material Pulse as a Fundamental Entity  
The concept of the material pulse forms the foundat ion of the Theory of Material Pulses, 
replacing the traditional notions of particles as p oint-like or wave-like entities. In this theory, 
the material pulse is a dynamic configuration of ma tter and energy in space. Instead of 
perceiving particles as distinct and fixed entities  that exist independently of their 
environment, the material pulse is a state shaped a nd transformed by the interactions 
occurring in space and time. 
Conceptually, modern physics has been characterized  by two central concepts: particles  
and waves , which have remained fundamentally incompatible. P articles are localized and 
indivisible, whereas waves are extended and divisib le. This fundamental contradiction has 
been at the core of many attempts at unification, a s neither of these concepts can fully 
describe the properties of physical entities found in nature. The concept of the material pulse 
comes to reconcile these two conflicting entities b y presenting the particle as a dynamic 
pulse-like field configuration, thus combining the properties of both particles and waves. 
Moreover, there is another significant division in physics: that between classical physics  
and quantum physics , each with completely different theoretical founda tions. Classical 
physics is based on causality, where every event ha s a specific cause and effect, whereas 
quantum physics introduces randomness and probabili ty as fundamental concepts. The concept of the material pulse comes to bridge this discrepancy by attributing a causal nature 
to quantum physics, essentially "classicalizing"  the description of quantum phenomena. As a 
result, the material pulse allows for a causal inte rpretation in quantum physics, providing a 
consistent framework that merges classical and quan tum features. 
The material pulse can be described as a localized configuration of the field that gathers 
energy and charge. This accumulation is not static but has an internal dynamic, meaning that 
its physical properties, such as mass, energy, and charge, depend on the interaction of the 
pulse with external fields. This idea is consistent  with the views of general relativity, where 
the curvature of spacetime is determined by the dis tribution of mass and energy [ 4]. 
The dynamic nature of the material pulse thus leads  to a reconciliation of classical and 
quantum views. Traditional quantum properties, such  as spin , are no longer considered as 
fundamental, independent properties but emerge as c onsequences of the internal motion of 
the pulse. This reinterpretation offers a natural, causal explanation for many properties of 
particles that, in the conventional theory, are see n as abstract or artificially introduced. For 
instance, charge  can be understood as the result of an asymmetry in  the distribution of the 
material pulse, while spin  emerges from the internal rotational movements wit hin the pulse. 
Another key aspect of the theory of Material Pulses  is the inseparable connection  of the 
pulse with the fields surrounding it. Unlike the tr aditional view of particles, where fields are 
treated as external entities affecting particles, i n the theory of Material Pulses, the pulse and 
the field are two facets of the same physical entit y. This interdependence implies that the 
dynamics of the material pulse cannot be separated from its environment. Material pulses 
continuously adapt to and are affected by the chang es in external fields, allowing them to 
incorporate all known interactions without the need  for distinct, independent fields like 
gravitational or electromagnetic. 
Overall, the material pulse offers a cohesive appro ach to describing matter and energy, 
linking field dynamics to the entity itself. In thi s way, the material pulse becomes the 
foundation of this new theory, enabling the unifica tion of physical interactions and providing 
a novel understanding of the structure and evolutio n of nature. 
4.  Mathematical Formulation and Fundamental Equations of the Theory of Material 
Pulses 
The Theory of Material Pulses is grounded in fundam ental equations that describe the 
dynamics and interactions of material pulses within  spacetime. These equations incorporate 
the principles of least action, the interaction of pulses with fields, and include the Klein-
Gordon equation, Einstein's field equations, and th e technique of minimal coupling. 
 
4.1. General Klein-Gordon Equation 
 
The general form of the Klein-Gordon equation provi des the foundation for describing the 
behavior of material pulses in curved spacetime. Th is equation incorporates the effects of 
spacetime curvature as described by General Relativ ity, and is given by: 
 
 
 
 
where: 
 □gis the curved spacetime d'Alembertian operator, whi ch is defined using covariant 
derivatives that take into account the curvature of  spacetime. 
 m is the mass of the material pulse. 
 c is the speed of light.  ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant. 
 ψ represents the wave function that describes the p ulse's spatial and temporal 
distribution. 
The curved d'Alembertian operator □ gincorporates the Christoffel symbols   to account 
for spacetime curvature, and can be expressed as: 
 
 
 
where ∇μ  represents the covariant derivative. 
For simplicity, and without loss of generality, we can also proceed by using the flat spacetime 
version of the Klein-Gordon equation, which facilit ates a more straightforward analysis. In 
flat spacetime, the d'Alembertian operator reduces to: 
 
 
 
leading to the simplified form: 
 
 
 
 
This flat spacetime equation remains consistent wit h the principles of Special 
Relativity, maintaining Lorentz symmetry while prov iding a simpler framework for 
calculations [ 2, 3, 12 ]. 
 
4.2. Principle of Least Action 
 
The Principle of Least Action serves as the foundat ion for describing the dynamics of 
material pulses. In the context of General Relativi ty, the principle is expressed through the 
Einstein-Hilbert action: 
 
 
 
 
where: 
 R is the Ricci curvature scalar, describing spaceti me curvature, 
 g is the determinant of the metric tensor that char acterizes the geometry of spacetime, 
 G is the gravitational constant [ 4]. 
General Relativity thus provides a dynamic geometry  for spacetime, shaped by the 
interaction with energy. This fundamental principle  is critical in describing the dynamics of 
the material pulse and its interaction with spaceti me. 
For material pulses, the action S is defined as the  integral of the Lagrangian L over time: 
 
 
 
From minimizing the action using the Euler-Lagrange  equations, we derive the 
equations of motion for the material pulse: 
 
 
 
which describe the path and 
evolution of the material pulse within spacetime [ 19 ].  
4.3. Interactions via Minimal Coupling 
 
To describe the interactions of material pulses wit h electromagnetic fields, the 
minimal coupling technique is employed. This involv es replacing the spacetime derivative ∂ μ  
with the covariant derivative D μ: 
 
              
 
where: 
 Aμ is the four-potential of the electromagnetic field , 
 q is the charge of the pulse. 
In the context of curved spacetime, the derivative is further adapted to: 
 
 
 
where ∇μ  represents the covariant derivative in curved spa cetime. With this substitution, the 
Klein-Gordon equation in a curved spacetime under e lectromagnetic influence becomes: 
 
 
 
 
 
 This equation describes the behavior of the materi al pulse under the influence of 
electromagnetic fields, ensuring the minimization o f action during the interactions between 
the pulse and the fields [ 1, 5, 7]. 
Thus, while the general Klein-Gordon equation encom passes the curved spacetime 
scenario, we often simplify the representation to t he flat spacetime case for ease of application 
and interpretation, without undermining the general  validity of the theory. This approach 
allows for a cohesive understanding of how the mate rial pulse interacts within the 
framework of both Special and General Relativity, m erging concepts traditionally separated 
in classical and quantum realms. 
 
Physical Interpretation 
 
The application of minimal coupling implies that ma terial pulses follow a 
"minimized" path through spacetime, influenced by e xternal fields. In other words, the 
trajectory and dynamics of the pulses are determine d such that the total action is minimized, 
taking into account the presence of the electromagn etic field. 
The use of the covariant derivative ensures that th e interaction of material pulses 
with the field is symmetric under gauge transformat ions, meaning that the physical equations 
remain invariant under local changes in the phase o f the wavefunction. This principle is also 
known as "gauge invariance" and is a fundamental sy mmetry for interactions involving 
electromagnetic fields. 
 
Interpretation of Consequences in the Stern-Gerlach  Experiment 
 
With this approach, we can also re-examine the resu lts of the Stern-Gerlach 
experiment. The theory of Material Pulses interpret s the separation of the signal in the Stern-
Gerlach experiment not as a result of different spi n states but as a consequence of the 
movement of pulses with opposite charges interactin g with the magnetic field. The interaction through minimal coupling allows the sep aration of the pulses, determining their 
distinct paths through spacetime, which explains th e presence of two distinct signals. 
In this way, the properties traditionally attribute d to spin are now reinterpreted in terms of 
charge interactions and the internal dynamics of th e pulse. This simplifies and 
"demagnetizes" the need for abstract concepts like spin as an independent quantum property. 
The minimal coupling technique is fundamental to fo rmulating the interaction of 
material pulses with external fields. By using the covariant derivative, consistency with 
Lorentz symmetry and gauge symmetry is maintained, providing a natural framework for 
incorporating electromagnetic interactions into the  description of material pulses. 
 
Methodology 
 
5.  Deriving Fundamental Field Equations through the Ac tion Principle 
 The Principle of Least Action will be applied dire ctly to the differential equation [10] to 
determine how both the equations of the electromagn etic field and the gravitational field can 
emerge from this formalism. The process begins by d efining the action functional, followed 
by deriving the corresponding fundamental equations . 
5.1. Action  Function and Application to the Klein-Gordon Equati on 
To apply the Principle of Least Action to this equa tion, we need to define the appropriate 
action function S, which is the integral of the Lag rangian L. The Lagrangian corresponding to 
the above equation can be written as: 
 
where: 
 ημν  is the Minkowski metric tensor (flat spacetime). 
 Dμ  is the covariant derivative, which includes inter action with the electromagnetic 
field. 
 ψ is the wavefunction of the material pulse. 
The total Lagrangian includes the terms related to the material pulse, the electromagnetic 
field, and the gravitational field: 
 
where:

5.2. Equation of Motion from the Principle of Least  Action 
The action function is defined as: 
  
 
 
To derive the equations of motion, we apply the Pri nciple of Least Action, which states: 
 
                                                                                   δS=0 
 
The minimization of the action using the Euler-Lagr ange equations for the field ψ 
gives: 
 
 
 
 
Applying this to the Lagrangian L ψ : 
 
 
 
 
This is essentially the Klein-Gordon equation with the application of minimal 
coupling. The covariant derivative D μ includes the interaction with the electromagnetic f ield 
through the four-potential A μ . 
5.3. Electromagnetic Field Equations 
To derive the equations of the electromagnetic fiel d, we minimize the action with 
respect to the field A μ. The Lagrangian including the interaction with the  electromagnetic 
field is: 
 
Applying the Principle of Least Action to A μ : 
 
 
 
This is the general form of Maxwell's equations, wh ere the current j μ results from the 
motion of the charged material pulse. 
5.4. Gravitational Field and Einstein Equations 
The Lagrangian describing the gravitational field i s the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian: 
 
 
 
Minimizing the action with respect to the metric te nsor g μν  yields the Einstein field 
equations: 
 
 
 
 where T μν  is the energy-momentum tensor, which includes cont ributions from the 
material pulse and the electromagnetic field. 
 
By applying the Principle of Least Action to the to tal Lagrangian, we simultaneously 
obtain: 
o The Klein-Gordon equation for describing the materi al pulses. 
o Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field. 
o Einstein's field equations for the gravitational fi eld. 
This demonstrates how the unified application of th e Principle of Least Action leads 
to the emergence of electromagnetic and gravitation al interactions from the fundamental 
description of material pulses. 
Results and Analysis 
6.  Interactions and Negative Energies  
The theory of Material Pulses introduces a new appr oach to interpreting the negative 
solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, which have been a topic of discussion in physics for 
decades. In traditional quantum field theory, these  negative solutions are interpreted as 
antiparticles, meaning particles that have the same  magnitude but opposite charge as their 
corresponding "positive" particles. While this inte rpretation has proven quite effective 
experimentally, it does not provide an intuitive ex planation for the existence of these negative 
energies. 
In the theory of Material Pulses, the negative solu tions are interpreted differently: 
they are not merely representations of antiparticle s but are instead viewed as dynamic states 
of the material pulse, linked to antigravitational or other opposing forces. These inverse 
dynamic states are related to the interaction of th e pulse with spacetime and external fields. 
This interpretation introduces the idea that the ne gative solutions of the Klein-Gordon 
equation represent different phases of the dynamic behavior of the material pulse rather than 
just particles with "negative" properties. 
This new interpretive framework allows us to think of negative solutions as 
expressions of dynamic states that can give rise to  opposing forces, such as antigravity. This 
means that when we observe the interactions of mate rial pulses under specific conditions, the 
negative energies may contribute to the creation of  apparently repulsive or attractive forces, 
depending on the interaction with external fields. This could explain the apparent emergence 
of strong and weak nuclear interactions, which can be considered not as independent 
fundamental forces but as phenomena arising from th e internal dynamics of the pulses and 
their negative solutions. 
The existence of negative energies can also be inte rpreted in a way that provides a 
natural explanation for phenomena that traditionall y required the existence of specific 
"interactions" or fields. For example, the attracti ons and repulsions observed at the subatomic 
level do not need to be considered results of separ ate fundamental forces, such as strong and 
weak forces, but instead can be understood as the c onsequence of the interactions of pulses 
through the negative solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. 
This new perspective leads to a revision of our und erstanding of how physical 
interactions emerge at the subatomic level. The neg ative solutions of the Klein-Gordon 
equation provide a new way of understanding the app earance of attractive or repulsive 
forces, not through the introduction of additional abstract fields but as a natural consequence 
of the structure and dynamics of the material pulse s. 
Furthermore, these negative solutions contribute si gnificantly to understanding the 
stability of the pulses and their interactions with  external fields. If we consider that negative energies represent dynamic states leading to opposi ng force directions, we can explain how 
material pulses maintain stability or experience "r epulsive" forces that prevent collapse. This 
mechanism can be used to interpret the stability of  interactions between elementary particles 
without the need for additional levels or interacti ons. 
Ultimately, analyzing the negative energies of the Klein-Gordon equation within the 
theory of Material Pulses reveals a new, unified pe rspective of physical forces, where 
phenomena traditionally attributed to fundamental f orces naturally emerge from the 
dynamics of the pulses. This perspective offers a d eeper understanding of the nature of forces 
and interactions, unifying the description of pheno mena observed at both macroscopic and 
microscopic levels. 
7.  Internal Structure and Interpretation of Spin 
In traditional quantum physics, spin is considered an intrinsic quantum property of 
particles, typically described through the spin ope rator and its interaction with magnetic 
fields, as demonstrated in the Stern-Gerlach experi ment [8]. In the Theory of Material Pulses, 
we reevaluate this concept and redefine spin not as  a fundamental property, but as a 
consequence of the internal dynamics and rotational  motion of the material pulse. 
The material pulse is considered as a structure tha t carries a distribution of charge 
and energy. In this context, spin can be understood  as a result of the movement of the 
charged components within the pulse, creating a kin d of "magnetic dipole" analogous to the 
interpretation of spin in conventional frameworks. The asymmetry in the distribution of the 
material pulse, combined with its internal motion, generates dynamics that can be interpreted 
as spin. This approach differs significantly from t he conventional description, in which spin is 
arbitrarily imposed on the wavefunction, without th e wavefunction inherently containing 
such information. Spin does not naturally arise fro m the mathematical form of the 
wavefunction, but is artificially added to account for observed phenomena. 
In Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field [7 ], the concept of magnetic moments 
emerging from the motion of charges is introduced. This concept provides an analogous basis 
for interpreting spin within the material pulse, as  the dynamic distribution of charges within 
the pulse produces a magnetic moment that is simila r to the traditional concept of spin. 
A novel approach to the Stern-Gerlach experiment is  to consider that the emergence 
of two distinct signals does not correspond to the existence of two different spin states, but 
rather to two distinct pulses with opposite charges , which are separated under the influence 
of the magnetic field. In other words, the magnetic  field causes the separation of the two 
states due to their opposite charge distribution, r ather than internal angular momentum. This 
interpretative framework offers a more natural expl anation for the separation without 
needing to introduce abstract spin as an independen t quantum property. 
This perspective not only provides a more natural i nterpretation for the origin of spin 
but also eliminates the need for introducing additi onal exogenous quantities to describe the 
magnetic properties of particles. Instead of referr ing to a mathematical convention without a 
physical basis, spin in this theory arises from the  internal processes and charge and energy 
distributions within the material pulse. 
Moreover, this viewpoint integrates the causal appr oach adopted by the Theory of 
Material Pulses, as the rotational movement and cha rge distribution within the pulse are 
intrinsic properties of its structure, without requ iring the assumption of abstract, independent 
properties. This new interpretation simplifies the physical understanding of spin and 
redefines it within the framework of fundamental in teractions based on the internal dynamics 
of pulses. 
 
Discussion   
8.  Advantages of the Theory of Material Pulses 
 
i.  Unification and Elimination of Abstract Properties:  Charge and Spin  In the 
Theory of Material Pulses, there is a radical reeva luation of traditional abstract properties 
such as charge and spin, providing a fundamental an d clear distinction between them. 
Charge remains as an inherent, fundamental property  emerging from the structure of 
material pulses. It is interpreted as a result of t he specific arrangement of "elementary pulses" 
within the material pulse, where each elementary pu lse carries a quantum of charge. This 
approach not only naturally explains the quantizati on of charge but also offers a consistent 
understanding of the origin and conservation of cha rge in fundamental particles. 
Spin, on the other hand, is not retained as an inde pendent property, as it is in 
conventional quantum theories. Instead, it is aboli shed and emerges as a phenomenon 
resulting from the internal dynamics of the pulse, specifically the rotational movements of the 
charges within the pulse. In this way, the theory s implifies the physical understanding of 
particles, avoiding abstract and artificial concept s that lack a physical basis, and replaces spin 
with a more intuitive and mechanical approach. 
ii.  Avoidance of Renormalization and Reevaluation of Qu antum Field Theory 
Methodology  One of the major advantages of the Theory of Mater ial Pulses is its rejection of 
the process of renormalization, which remains a con troversial tool in quantum field theory. 
Renormalization, often used to handle infinities, n ot only contains mathematical ambiguities 
but is also of questionable experimental validity. In practice, this process imposes artificial 
mathematical interventions to "cover" the gaps and shortcomings of the model, without a 
deep physical interpretation. 
The Theory of Material Pulses is formulated in such  a way that renormalization is not 
required. Its fundamental equations are constructed  in a consistent mathematical manner that 
avoids infinities from the outset, providing a more  natural and coherent foundation for 
understanding interactions. This eliminates the nee d for mathematical "corrections" that lack 
any physical substance, making the theory more tran sparent and reliable. 
iii.  Interpretation of Dark Energy in a Natural Way  One significant unresolved 
issue in modern physics is the existence of dark en ergy, which appears to be responsible for 
the accelerated expansion of the universe. In the s tandard model, dark energy is an abstract 
concept introduced more to "balance" the energy bud get of the universe rather than being a 
comprehensible physical phenomenon. 
The Theory of Material Pulses, on the other hand, p rovides a natural interpretation of 
dark energy. According to this theory, dark energy can be understood as a fundamental 
dynamic of spacetime itself, directly related to th e properties of material pulses and their 
inherent behavior. This approach treats dark energy  not as a mysterious entity but as an 
intrinsic property of the material pulse and spacet ime, which interacts in a way that promotes 
cosmological acceleration. This interpretation simp lifies the cosmological model and provides 
a natural cause for the accelerated expansion. 
iv.  Interpretation of Dark Matter through the Unity of Matter  Another key 
advantage of the theory is the new interpretation o f dark matter. Dark matter, until now, has 
been one of the biggest challenges for modern cosmo logy and astrophysics, as it does not 
interact with the electromagnetic field and cannot be observed directly. The fact that this 
matter neither emits, absorbs, nor scatters light i s one of the major weaknesses of the standard 
model. 
The Theory of Material Pulses provides a coherent i nterpretation of dark matter by 
considering it as nothing more than the primordial,  unified form of matter that has not 
undergone the disturbances leading to electromagnet ic interaction. This form of matter 
remains compact and undisturbed, without having "br oken" into material pulses that interact electromagnetically. From this perspective, dark ma tter represents a kind of "undisturbed" or 
"primordial" form of matter that can be seen as the  basis from which known particles are 
formed through disturbances. 
v.  Simplification and Physical Coherence of the Theory  The Theory of 
Material Pulses offers a simplified and physically consistent framework for the functioning of 
the universe. It avoids the artificial division bet ween classical and quantum physics while 
simultaneously providing a unified understanding of  interactions. The principle of least 
action and the fundamental equations derived from i t enable the unification of classical and 
quantum interactions within a coherent framework. T he simplification achieved through the 
elimination of independent abstract properties, suc h as spin, and the introduction of the idea 
that all phenomena are a consequence of the interna l dynamics of material pulses, make the 
theory more comprehensible and natural. 
These advantages highlight that the Theory of Mater ial Pulses not only provides a 
new, unified framework for understanding physical p henomena but also avoids the 
shortcomings and gaps of the standard model, making  it a promising candidate for the 
unification of the laws of physics. 
 
9.  Prospects and Future Research  
 
The Theory of Material Pulses opens new horizons fo r understanding physical 
phenomena and unifying the interactions observed in  the universe. Future directions for 
research can be distinguished into several areas, i ncluding experimental verification, 
development of new theoretical models, and applicat ions in fields such as cosmology and 
particle physics. 
Experimental Proposals for Verification of the Theo ry 
One of the primary objectives of future research is  the experimental verification of the 
predictions made by the Theory of Material Pulses. Experiments such as modified Stern-
Gerlach setups could verify whether spin can be int erpreted as a result of the internal 
dynamics of material pulses rather than as an intri nsic quantum property. Additionally, the 
development of new scattering experiments could det ect specific characteristics of material 
pulses, such as the hypothesis of antigravity that emerges from the negative solutions of the 
Klein-Gordon equation. These experiments could be c arried out in accelerator laboratories 
and specialized facilities that can investigate gra vitational effects. 
Study of Antigravity and New Interactions 
The introduction of antigravity as a possible dynam ic arising from the negative 
solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation represents a  significant field for future research. 
Experiments could be conducted to directly search f or evidence of antigravitational forces, 
particularly in systems where interactions between matter and antimatter may occur. If such 
forces can be observed, this would fundamentally ch ange our understanding of gravity and 
gravitational interactions. 
Extending the Theory to Cosmology 
The Theory of Material Pulses provides a new founda tion for understanding dark 
matter and dark energy, suggesting that dark matter  is a primordial form of matter that has 
not undergone perturbations, while dark energy is r elated to the geometry of spacetime and 
its internal dynamics. Future research should focus  on developing mathematical models that 
connect the theory with cosmological phenomena, suc h as the accelerated expansion of the 
universe and the unification of cosmological consta nts with the dynamics of material pulses. 
Revisiting Nuclear Physics and Interactions 
The theory eliminates the need for strong and weak nuclear forces as fundamental 
interactions, suggesting instead that these arise f rom the internal motion and interaction of 
material pulses under the influence of negative ene rgies. Future research should focus on constructing new models to understand nuclear stabi lity and atomic structure, seeking ways 
to unify nuclear interactions within the framework of material pulses. 
Experimental Evaluation of Renormalization 
The theory rejects renormalization as a method of d ubious experimental validity. 
Future research could focus on the study of experim ents that evaluate the outcomes of 
renormalization in specific physical systems. This would involve developing methods that 
avoid divergences without using artificial mathemat ical procedures, providing a physical 
interpretation of predictions instead. 
Development of New Mathematical Tools 
The Theory of Material Pulses is based on a series of new mathematical tools, 
including the application of the Principle of Least  Action, the use of covariant derivatives, 
and the extension of the Klein-Gordon equation to c urved spacetimes. The development of 
new mathematical techniques will be critical for fu rther understanding and evolving the 
theory, especially for describing more complex inte ractions under extreme conditions, such as 
near black holes or regions of intense spacetime cu rvature. 
Collaboration with the Experimental Community 
The theory offers new predictions that need experim ental testing, which requires 
collaboration with the experimental community. The execution of tests involving advanced 
scattering techniques and measurements at microscop ic scales will be crucial to verify the 
theory's predictions and identify potential modific ations or improvements needed. 
Overall Evaluation and Adoption by the Scientific C ommunity 
Finally, it is essential that the theory be assesse d and evaluated by the scientific 
community. Publishing and communicating the results  with international scientists is key for 
integrating these new ideas into mainstream physics . This will require not only the 
publication of theoretical results but also the org anization of conferences and workshops 
aimed at educating and deepening the understanding of these new concepts. 
Conclusions 
In this work, we presented the Theory of Material P ulses, a novel framework that 
aims to unify physical interactions and provide a d eeper understanding of phenomena that 
have traditionally been interpreted through distinc t and sometimes incompatible theoretical 
approaches. The theory introduces the material puls e as the fundamental structure of matter 
and energy, challenging the classical distinction b etween particles and fields and merging the 
concepts of particles and waves into a unified enti ty. 
Through the application of the Principle of Least A ction in a curved spacetime, we 
demonstrated how the equations for the electromagne tic and gravitational fields naturally 
emerge as consequences of the fundamental descripti on of material pulses. Simultaneously, 
we reinterpreted the negative solutions of the Klei n-Gordon equation as states of dynamic 
antigravity, offering a new perspective on the exis tence of antimatter and the internal forces 
that hold atomic nuclei together. 
The theory also provides a natural interpretation o f charge and spin. Charge emerges 
as a result of structural asymmetry and the quantiz ation of fundamental pulses, while spin is 
no longer viewed as an independent quantum property  but as a consequence of the internal 
dynamics and rotational motion of the pulse. This r emoves the need for abstract quantum 
properties that are introduced arbitrarily, giving the theory a more causal character. 
Furthermore, successful interpretations were presen ted for phenomena such as dark 
matter and dark energy, where dark matter is descri bed as the primary, undisturbed form of 
matter, while dark energy is interpreted as a conse quence of the dynamic geometry of 
spacetime, emerging from the internal movement of p ulses. In this way, the theory provides a holistic framework for understanding physical pheno mena, aiming to bridge the gap between 
classical and quantum physics and ultimately lead t o a unified, final theory of nature. 
However, the Theory of Material Pulses remains unde r development and requires 
experimental verification through proposals such as  modified Stern-Gerlach experiments and 
measurements of antigravity forces. Additionally, n ew mathematical tools and approaches 
need to be developed for the complete incorporation  of the theory into complex phenomena, 
such as black holes and the accelerated expansion o f the universe. 
Overall, the Theory of Material Pulses is a promisi ng framework that offers new 
answers to major questions in modern physics and pa ves the way for a more coherent and 
unified understanding of natural phenomena. Its exp erimental and theoretical investigation 
will determine whether this new approach can be ado pted as the foundation for the physics 
of the future.
