Abstract  
Photons, the fundamental quanta of light, are widely recognized as carriers of energy and 
mediators of electromagnetic interactions. This paper proposes that photons also encode the 
"address" of quantum interactions within the holographic plane, providing a mechanism for 
coordinating quantum phenomena across spacetime. Building on the framework presented in 
Emergent Universe from Many Unreal World Interpretatio n [6], this hypothesis suggests that 
photons function as messengers of spatial and informational coordinates, offering new 
interpretations of wave function collapse, quantum entanglement, and delayed -choice 
experiments. This approach integrates the holographic principle with quantum mechanics, 
potentially bridging two foundational theories of modern physics.  
 
Introduction  
The holographic principle, rooted in black hole thermodynamics, asserts that the information 
describing a volume of space is encoded on its boundary  [1]. This principle has inspired 
theoretical advances in string theory and quantum gravity. Photons, as the most fundamental 
particles mediating electromagnetic forces, interact universally, making them ideal candidates to 
encode and transmit this boundary information.  
In prior work ( Emergent Universe from Many Unreal World Interpretation ), a framework was 
introduced wherein all particles are assigned unique addresses in the holographic plane  [6]. This 
paper extends that idea by hypothesizing that photons are the primary carriers of these addresses. 
By examining the quantum behaviors of photons, such as entanglement and interference  [4][5] , 
we propose that their informational role provides a coherent explanation for phenomena that 
challenge classical interpretations of quantum mechanics.  
 
Theoretical Framework  
1. Address Encoding in the Holographic Plane  
Each particle’s address in the holographic plane represents its unique identity and position in 
spacetime. This address can be mathematically modeled as a point on a holographic boundary 
surface  [1] [6] . For photons, the encoding of this address could manifest through:  • Phase and Frequency:  Variations in the photon's wave function might correspond to 
spatial or temporal components of the address  [2] [3] . 
• Polarization States:  Quantum information encoded in polarization could represent the 
orientation of the address in higher -dimensional space  [5]. 
Mathematical Model:  
   𝝍𝒑𝒉𝒐𝒕𝒐𝒏 =𝒇(𝒙,𝒚,𝒛,𝒕;𝝓,𝜽) 
where x, y,z  are spatial coordinates, t is time, and θ, ϕ are angular parameters encoding 
holographic information.  
2. Wave Function Collapse as Address Updates  
When photons interact with a system, such as a detector or another particle, the interaction can 
be interpreted as an exchange or update of address information. The wave function collapse 
corresponds to the resolution of uncertainty in the photon's address  [6][7] . Mathematically, this 
can be expressed as:  
   𝝍𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒍 (𝒙,𝒚,𝒛,𝒕)→𝝍𝒄𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒂𝒑𝒔𝒆𝒅 (𝒙′,𝒚′,𝒛′,𝒕′) 
where the transition reflects the photon's updated spatial -temporal and informational coordinates.  
3. Photon as a Messenger in Quantum Entanglement  
Entangled photons share an address in the holographic plane  [6][4] . When one photon is 
measured, its address is updated, and this update propagates instantaneously to its entangled 
counterpart. This mechanism ensures consistency across spacetime without violating causality  
[4][5] . 
 
Connections to Experiments  
1. Double -Slit Experiment  
The hypothesis reframes the double -slit experiment as a process where photons project their 
addresses across multiple possible paths in the holographic plane. When unobserved, the 
photon’s address remains unresolved, resulting in an interference pattern due to the superposition 
of all possible paths:  
𝝍𝒔𝒍𝒊𝒕=𝝍𝟏+𝝍𝟐 
where ψ1  and ψ2  are the wave functions corresponding to each slit. Observation resolves the 
address into one specific path, collapsing the wave function  [4][6][7] . 
2. Delayed -Choice Quantum Eraser  In this experiment, the photon’s address evolves dynamically as it traverses the setup. Entangled 
idler photons serve as retroactive messengers, updating the spatial address information of signal 
photons. This hypothesis eliminates the need for retrocausality by framing the observed patterns 
as outcomes of address resolution across entangled states  [4]. 
3. Quantum Communication  
Photons transmitting address information could revolutionize quantum communication protocols. 
For instance, encoding addresses in photon polarization states allows for secure, high -fidelity 
transmission of quantum keys  [5][6] . 
 
Experimental Verification  
1. Photon Address Manipulation  
o Create experimental setups to measure whether variations in polarization or phase 
correspond to holographic address changes during interactions  [3][5] . 
2. Entanglement Correlation  
o Test whether entangled photon pairs exhibit measurable correlations in address -
like properties beyond existing quantum entanglement parameters  [4][6] . 
3. Delayed -Choice Adaptations  
o Modify the delayed -choice experiment to directly observe address encoding 
mechanisms, using high -precision detectors to track photon behavior before and 
after wave function collapse  [4][6] . 
 
Implications  
1. Quantum Mechanics and Information Theory  
o This approach provides a unified framework for interpreting quantum phenomena 
as manifestations of holographic address dynamics. It could redefine our 
understanding of wave -particle duality and non -locality  [6][7] . 
2. Holography and Gravity  
o If photons carry holographic information, this could deepen our understanding of 
how spacetime geometry interacts with quantum fields, potentially informing 
theories of quantum gravity  [1][6] . 
3. Quantum Computing and Communication  
o Encoding address information in photons could pave the way for new quantum 
technologies, such as holographic quantum networks and more secure quantum 
cryptography  [5]. 
 
Conclusion  By hypothesizing that photons encode and transmit holographic address information, this paper 
bridges quantum mechanics with the holographic principle. This framework offers fresh insights 
into quantum behaviors such as wave function collapse, entanglement, and interference, and 
suggests pathways for experimental validation and technological innovation. Future work will 
focus on refining the mathematical formalism and conducting experiments to validate these ideas  
[6][7] .
