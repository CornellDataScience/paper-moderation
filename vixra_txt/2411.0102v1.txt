Cost-Per-Byte Principle in Generative AI
Xiaoyi Li
Abstract
Generative AI models are increasingly used across various modalities, including
text, images, audio, and video. Estimating the computational cost of generating con-
tent is crucial for optimizing performance and resource allocation. This paper intro-
duces the Cost-Per-Byte Principle :C=T×I, a universal law that relates the cost
of content generation to per-byte generation time and per-second inference cost. We
derive the per-byte generation time analytically based on the model’s computational
requirements (FLOPs) and the hardware’s performance (FLOPs per second). By estab-
lishing mappings between bytes and different content units (characters, pixels, samples,
frames), we provide a modality-agnostic framework for cost estimation. We present a
rigorous proof of the principle’s validity and apply it to estimate the costs of current
popular models, using publicly available evidence to verify the accuracy and usefulness
of this principle.
1 Introduction
Generative AI models, such as Transformer-based models and Diffusion models, have revolu-
tionized content creation in natural language processing, computer vision, speech synthesis,
and other fields. As these models become more complex and resource-intensive, understand-
ing and managing the computational costs associated with content generation is essential for
efficient deployment and scaling.
This paper proposes the Cost-Per-Byte Principle , a universal law that quantifies the
cost of content generation based on the per-byte computational effort. By mapping bytes
to content units across different modalities—characters in text, pixels in images, samples
in audio, and frames in video—we establish a consistent framework for cost estimation.
Importantly, we demonstrate how to calculate the per-byte generation time using the model’s
computational requirements and hardware performance, enhancing the precision of our cost
estimations.
2 Background
2.1 Generative AI Models
Generative AI models aim to produce new data instances that resemble a given dataset.
These models vary in architecture and complexity, influencing their computational require-
ments, typically measured in floating-point operations (FLOPs).
12.2 Need for a Universal Cost Estimation Principle
Current cost estimation methods often lack universality and do not account for modality-
specific differences in data representation and computational complexity. A modality-agnostic
principle based on a fundamental unit like the byte, combined with computational metrics
like FLOPs, can provide a consistent and precise basis for cost estimation.
3 Related Works
Estimating the computational cost of generative AI models has been an area of active re-
search. Previous works have primarily focused on modality-specific approaches or general
computational cost estimation in terms of FLOPs and hardware performance. However,
there has been a lack of a universal, modality-agnostic framework that can be applied across
different types of content generation tasks. In this section, we review existing literature re-
lated to computational cost estimation in generative AI models and highlight the originality
of the Cost-Per-Byte Principle .
3.1 Computational Cost Estimation in AI Models
Several studies have analyzed the computational complexity of deep learning models, par-
ticularly focusing on training costs. Strubell et al. [2] estimated the energy and financial
costs associated with training various NLP models, highlighting the environmental impact
of large-scale AI models.
Canziani et al. [3] compared different convolutional neural network architectures in terms
of accuracy and computational cost, measured in FLOPs. Their work provided insights
into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance but was limited to image
classification tasks.
3.2 Modality-Specific Cost Analyses
Modality-specific analyses have been conducted for various domains:
•Natural Language Processing : Kaplan et al. [4] studied scaling laws for neural
language models, relating model size, dataset size, and performance but did not directly
address inference costs.
•Computer Vision : Latency and computational cost for object detection models were
examined by Huang et al. [5], focusing on speed-accuracy trade-offs.
•Speech Synthesis : Shen et al. [6] introduced the Tacotron 2 model and discussed
inference speed improvements but without a generalized cost estimation framework.
3.3 Cost Estimation Frameworks
Previous attempts to provide cost estimation frameworks have been specific to certain as-
pects:
2•Energy Consumption Models : Neural network energy models, such as those pro-
posed by Zhang et al. [7], estimate energy usage based on model parameters and
operations but do not translate directly to monetary cost.
•FLOPs-Based Cost Estimation : While FLOPs are commonly used to estimate
computational effort, there is a gap in connecting FLOPs to a universal cost measure
across different data modalities.
3.4 Originality of the Cost-Per-Byte Principle
The Cost-Per-Byte Principle distinguishes itself from prior works by providing a univer-
sal, modality-agnostic framework that directly relates computational cost to the size of the
generated content in bytes. By introducing the concept of per-byte generation time and
mapping FLOPs to bytes, this principle offers a consistent method for estimating inference
costs across different AI models and data types. To the best of our knowledge, no previous
work has proposed such a universal cost estimation principle that can be applied across
modalities, linking computational requirements, hardware performance, and data size in a
unified manner.
4 The Cost-Per-Byte Principle
4.1 Definition
TheCost-Per-Byte Principle states that the cost of generating content using a generative
AI model is given by:
C=Tbyte×I×S (1)
where:
•Cis the Total Cost (currency units).
•Tbyteis the Per-Byte Generation Time (seconds per byte).
•Iis the Per-Second Inference Cost (currency units per second).
•Sis the Total Data Size of the generated content (bytes).
4.2 Calculating Per-Byte Generation Time
ThePer-Byte Generation Time (Tbyte) can be calculated using the model’s computational
requirements and the hardware’s performance:
Tbyte=Fbyte
Phardware(2)
where:
3•Fbyteis the FLOPs per Byte required by the model.
•Phardware is the Hardware Performance in FLOPs per second.
4.2.1 FLOPs per Byte ( Fbyte)
The FLOPs per Byte is then obtained by dividing the total FLOPs by the total bytes:
Fbyte=Ftotal
S(3)
where:
•Fbyteis the FLOPs per Byte.
•Ftotalis the total number of FLOPs required to generate the content.
•Sis the total size of the content in bytes.
5 Proof of the Principle’s Validity
5.1 Fundamental Computational Principles
The computational cost is fundamentally a function of the total computational effort (in
FLOPs) and the cost per unit time of computation.
C=Ftotal
Phardware
×I (4)
Since Iis the cost per second and Phardware is in FLOPs per second, their ratio captures
the cost per FLOP.
5.2 Universality Across Modalities
By expressing costs in terms of FLOPs and bytes, we create a modality-agnostic framework.
Different modalities have different Fbytevalues, but the principle applies universally.
6 Case Studies

6.1.4 Total Computation Time and Cost
Assuming we generate Ntoken= 1,000 tokens:
•Total Data Size ( S):
S=Ntoken×Btoken= 1,000×4 = 4 ,000 bytes (9)
•Total Computation Time :
t=Tbyte×S= 1.1538×10−5×4,000 = 0 .04615 seconds (10)

56.1.5 Verification and Discussion
This extremely low cost aligns with the fact that GPT-2 inference is relatively inexpensive
and can be offered for free or at a low cost by various services. It demonstrates the practicality
of the Cost-Per-Byte Principle in estimating the cost of text generation.
6.2 Audio Generation Example

6.2.6 Verification and Discussion
Commercial text-to-speech services charge approximately $4 per 1 million characters [11],
which roughly translates to $0.004 per minute of speech. Our estimated cost of $0.008 is in
the same order of magnitude, considering overheads and profit margins.

6.3.6 Verification and Discussion
Commercial video rendering services can charge anywhere from $1 to$30 per minute of video,
depending on complexity. Our estimated cost of $10 is within this range, demonstrating the
applicability of the Cost-Per-Byte Principle.
87 Conclusion
TheCost-Per-Byte Principle provides a universal, modality-agnostic framework for estimat-
ing the cost of content generation in generative AI models. By calculating the per-byte
generation time based on the model’s computational requirements and hardware perfor-
mance, and by expressing the FLOPs per Byte as the total FLOPs divided by the total
bytes, we achieve a precise and scientifically robust method for cost estimation. Applying
this principle to various models using publicly available information verifies its accuracy and
demonstrates its practical utility.
