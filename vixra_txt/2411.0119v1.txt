November 18, 2024
Abstract
In this paper, we provide a detailed and rigorous proof that the series formed
by the reciprocals of Sophie Germain primes and the series formed by the recipro-
cals of safe primes are both convergent. Utilizing analytic techniques and careful
estimations of the counting functions for these primes, we establish upper bounds
that demonstrate the convergence of these series.

11 Introduction
A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number psuch that q= 2p+ 1 is also prime.
The number qis then called a safe prime . These primes are named after the F rench
mathematician Marie-Sophie Germain, who made significant contributions to number
theory , particularly in the study of F ermat’s Last Theorem.
The behavior of series formed by the reciprocals of special subsets of prime numbers is
a subject of deep interest in analytic number theory . While the sum of the reciprocals of
all prime numbers diverges (sinceP
p≤x1
p∼ln lnx), certain subsets, such as twin primes,
Sophie Germain primes, and safe primes, are suﬀiciently sparse that the sum of their
reciprocals converges.
In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and rigorous proof of the convergence
of the sums of the reciprocals of both Sophie Germain primes and safe primes. W e
will employ detailed estimations of their counting functions and utilize techniques from
analytic number theory to establish the necessary bounds.

ciently small to ensure convergence of the reciprocal sum. W e will show that πSG(x) =

4.1 Estimating the Counting F unction πSG(x)
While the exact asymptotic behavior of πSG(x)is unknown, we can derive an upper bound
based on sieve methods.
Lemma 1 : There exists a constant C1>0such that for all x≥2,
πSG(x)≤C1x
(lnx)2.
Proof of Lemma 1 :
LetπSG(x)denote the number of Sophie Germain primes less than or equal to x,
where a Sophie Germain prime pis a prime such that q= 2p+ 1 is also prime.
Our goal is to establish the upper bound
πSG(x)≤C1x
(lnx)2,
for some constant C1>0.
W e will employ the Brun sieve to estimate πSG(x). Consider the set
A=
n≤xnis an integer , p∤nandp∤2n+ 1 for all p∈ P
,
and let N=x.
LetP be the set of all primes up to a parameter z(to be chosen later), excluding
p= 2 , i.e.,
P={pprime |3≤p≤z}.
F or each prime p∈ P , define the set of residue classes Rp⊂Z/pZto be excluded:
Rp={0, rp},
4where rpsatisfies 2n+ 1≡0 mod pwhen n≡rpmod p.
Explanation of Residue Classes :
- Ifp|n, then n≡0 mod p.
- Ifp|2n+ 1 , then 2n+ 1≡0 mod p. Since p≥3is an odd prime, we have
gcd(2 , p) = 1 , so2is invertible modulo p. Therefore, we can solve for n:
2n≡ −1 mod p=⇒n≡(−1)·2−1mod p=⇒n≡p−1
2mod p.
Here, 2−1denotes the multiplicative inverse of 2modulo p, and−1·2−1≡p−1
2mod p
because −1≡p−1 mod p.
Thus, for each p∈ P , we exclude the residue classes 0andrp=p−1
2mod p. The
number of residue classes to exclude modulo pisνp= 2 .
Application of Brun’s Sieve :
The upper-bound form of Brun’s sieve states that the number S(A,P, z)of integers

Choosing the Parameter z:
Let us choose z=x1/2. Then lnz=1

Substituting back into the inequality for S(A,P, z), we get
S(A,P, z)≤N·C2
(lnz)2=C2x 1
2lnx2= 4C2x
(lnx)2.
Accounting for Primes Greater Than z:
In Brun’s sieve, we have an error term associated with larger primes p > z . Since
p > z =x1/2, any integer n≤xcan be divisible by at most one such prime p, because if
nwere divisible by two such primes, their product would exceed x.
The total number of integers n≤xdivisible by some prime p > z is at most
X
p>zx
p≤xX
p>z1
p.
Using the estimate for the sum over primes:
X
p>z1
p≤Z∞
zdt
tlnt= lim
T→∞(ln ln T−ln lnz) =∞.
This indicates that the sum diverges, but it does so very slowly . However, since each
n≤xdivisible by some p > z is counted at most once, the total number of such nis
≤x(ln ln x−ln lnz).
F orz=x1/2, this becomes
x 
ln lnx−ln 1
2lnx
=x(ln ln x−ln lnx+ ln 2) = xln 2.
6Thus, the total contribution from primes p > z isO(x), which is negligible compared to
the main termx
(lnx)2when xis large.
Conclusion :
Therefore, after accounting for all primes, we have
πSG(x)≤S(A,P, z) +O(x)≤(4C2+ε)x
(lnx)2,
where ε→0asx→ ∞ .
Thus, we have established the desired upper bound:
πSG(x)≤C1x
(lnx)2,
where C1= 4C2+ε.
Completing the Proof of Theorem 1 :
T o prove that the sum

Letxk= 2k, solnxk=kln 2 .
Consider the function

Then, from Lemma 1,
πSG(xk)≤C1f(k).
W e are interested in estimating the difference

∆πSG(k)≤C1[f(k+ 1)−f(k)] =C1f′(ξk)≤C1f′(k).
Using the expression for f′(k), we have

Therefore, the contribution to SSG from this interval is at most

LetC=C1. Then,

Therefore,

4.4 Conclusion of Theorem 1
Since SSG is bounded above by a convergent series, it follows that the sum of the recip-
rocals of all Sophie Germain primes converges.
Q.E.D.
5 Proof of Theorem 2
The proof for safe primes follows a similar structure to that of Sophie Germain primes.
5.1 Estimating the Counting F unction πSP(x)
Lemma 3 : There exists a constant C3>0such that for all x≥2,
πSP(x)≤C3x
(lnx)2.
Proof of Lemma 3 :
LetπSP(x)denote the number of safe primes less than or equal to x, where a safe
prime qis a prime such that p=q−1
2is also prime.
Our goal is to establish the upper bound
πSP(x)≤C3x
(lnx)2,
for some constant C3>0.
W e will employ the Brun sieve to estimate πSP(x). Consider the set

.
LetP be the set of all primes up to a parameter z(to be chosen later), excluding
p= 2 , i.e.,
P={pprime |3≤p≤z}.
F or each prime p∈ P , define the set of residue classes Rp⊂Z/pZto be excluded:
Rp={0, rp},
9where rpsatisfies 2n+ 1≡0 mod pwhen n≡rpmod p.
Since 2n+ 1≡0 mod pimplies n≡p−1
2mod p, we have
rp=p−1
2mod p.
Thus, for each p∈ P , we exclude the residue classes 0andrp=p−1
2.
Explanation of Residue Classes :
- Ifp|n, then n≡0 mod p.
- Ifp|2n+ 1 , then 2n+ 1≡0 mod p. Since p≥3is an odd prime and gcd(2 , p) = 1 ,
we can solve for n:
2n≡ −1 mod p=⇒n≡p−1
2mod p.
Thus, for each p∈ P , we exclude the residue classes 0andrp=p−1
2modulo p. The
number of residue classes to exclude modulo pisνp= 2 .

2. Thus,
S(A,P, z)≤x

(lnx)2=C4x
2(lnx)2.
Adjusting for Primes Greater Than z:
When we choose z=x, all primes p≤xare included in P. Therefore, there are no
additional primes p > z≤xto consider, and we do not need to adjust for larger primes.
Moreover, since we are interested in qsuch that both qandp=q−1
2are prime, the
actual count πSP(x)is less than or equal to S(A,P, z). This is because S(A,P, z)includes
integers nfor which 2n+ 1 may not be prime due to composite factors not detected by
the sieve.
Conclusion :
Therefore,
πSP(x)≤S(A,P, z)≤C4x
2(lnx)2.
Setting C3=C4

W e are interested in estimating the difference

5.4 Conclusion of Theorem 2
Since SSP is bounded above by a convergent series, it follows that the sum of the recip-
rocals of all safe primes converges.
Q.E.D.
5.5 Alternative Proof Based on Sophie Germain Primes
If we have already established that the sum of the reciprocals of Sophie Germain primes
converges, we can deduce that the sum of the reciprocals of safe primes also converges.
Consider the one-to-one correspondence between Sophie Germain primes and safe
primes defined by q= 2p+1 , where pis a Sophie Germain prime and qis the corresponding
safe prime. Since each safe prime qis uniquely associated with a Sophie Germain prime
p, we can relate their reciprocals.
Observe that1

Therefore,X

Since the sumP

q=2p+1, p∈P1
q<∞.
This provides an alternative proof of Theorem 2 based on the convergence of the sum
over Sophie Germain primes.
Q.E.D.
136 Discussion
The convergence of the sums SSG andSSP illustrates the relative sparsity of Sophie
Germain primes and safe primes among all prime numbers. The fact that their counting
functions grow no faster thanx
(lnx)2is crucial for the convergence of the reciprocals. By
the integral test for series convergence, a series with terms decreasing like1
x/(lnx)2will
converge, highlighting the significant impact of the counting function’s growth rate on
the convergence of the reciprocal series.
This contrasts with the set of all primes, for which the counting function π(x)∼x
lnx
leads to the divergence ofP
p≤x1
p. Despite primes becoming sparser as numbers grow
larger, the harmonic series over the primes diverges due to the subtle balance between
the decreasing size of the terms and the increasing number of primes, albeit at a slower
rate than the integers.
Our proofs rely on upper bounds for πSG(x)andπSP(x)derived from sieve methods
and average estimates of primes in arithmetic progressions. While the exact asymptotic
densities of these primes remain unproven and are subject to conjecture—such as the
Hardy-Littlewood conjecture generalized for these cases—the established upper bounds
suﬀice to demonstrate the convergence of the sums. Conjecturally , the number of Sophie
Germain primes less than xis believed to be approximately Cx
(lnx)2, where C is a
constant involving the twin prime constant, though this remains an open problem in
number theory .
The convergence of the sums provides insight into the distribution of these primes
and underscores the delicate interplay between term size and quantity in determining the
convergence of infinite series. It also raises questions about whether improved bounds on
πSG(x)andπSP(x)might be achievable with advancements in sieve methods or analytic
techniques.
7 Conclusion
W e have rigorously proven that the sums of the reciprocals of Sophie Germain primes
and safe primes are both convergent. This result underscores the thinness of these sets
within the prime numbers and provides insight into their distribution. The convergence
indicates that these primes are suﬀiciently rare compared to all primes, whose reciprocal
sum diverges.
This work contributes to the understanding of prime distributions and highlights
the effectiveness of sieve methods in establishing density estimates for special classes of
primes. Potential implications of these results extend to fields such as cryptography ,
where the properties of such primes are utilized. F urther research may focus on improv-
ing the bounds for πSG(x)andπSP(x), exploring their exact asymptotic behaviors, or
examining similar questions for other special classes of primes.
