In special relativity, this paper presents four net forces, which can be
applied in any massive or non-massive particle, and where the relationship
between net force and special acceleration is as in Newton’s second law
( that is, the special acceleration of any massive or non-massive particle
is always in the direction of the net force acting on the particle )
Introduction
In special relativity, this paper is obtained starting from the essential deﬁnitions of intrinsic
mass ( or invariant mass ) and relativistic factor ( or frequency factor ) for massive particles
and non-massive particles.
The intrinsic mass ( m) and the relativistic factor ( f) of a massive particle, are given by:
m.=mo (1)
f.=/parenleftBig
1−v·v
c2/parenrightBig−1/2
(2)
where ( mo) is the rest mass of the massive particle, ( v) is the velocity of the massive
particle, and ( c) is the speed of light in vacuum.
The intrinsic mass ( m) and the relativistic factor ( f) of a non-massive particle, are given by:
m.=h κ
c2(3)
f.=ν
κ(4)
where ( h) is the Planck constant, ( ν) is the frequency of the non-massive particle, ( κ) is
a positive universal constant with dimension of frequency, and ( c) is the speed of light in
vacuum.
According to this paper, a massive particle ( mo/negationslash= 0 ) is a particle with non-zero rest mass
( or a particle whose speed vin vacuum is less than c) and a non-massive particle ( mo= 0 )
is a particle with zero rest mass ( or a particle whose speed vin vacuum is c)
Note : The rest mass ( mo) and the intrinsic mass ( m) are in general not additive, and the
relativistic mass ( m ) of a particle ( massive or non-massive ) is given by : ( m.=m f)
1The Einsteinian Kinematics
The special position ( ¯r) the special velocity ( ¯v) and the special acceleration ( ¯a) of a particle
( massive or non-massive ) are given by:

where ( f) is the relativistic factor of the particle, ( v) is the velocity of the particle, and ( t)
is the ( coordinate ) time.
The Einsteinian Dynamics
If we consider a particle ( massive or non-massive ) with intrinsic mass ( m) then the
linear momentum ( P) of the particle, the angular momentum ( L) of the particle, the net
Einsteinian force ( FE) acting on the particle, the work ( W ) done by the net Einsteinian
force acting on the particle, and the kinetic energy ( K ) of the particle, are given by:

where ( f,r,v,¯v,¯a) are the relativistic factor, the position, the velocity, the special velocity
and the special acceleration of the particle, ( t) is the ( coordinate ) time, and ( c) is the
speed of light in vacuum. The kinetic energy ( K o) of a massive particle at rest is ( moc2)
since in this dynamics the relativistic energy ( E.=moc2(f−1 ) + moc2) and the kinetic
energy ( K.=m f c2) are the same ( E = K ) [ 1 ]
Note : E2−P2c2=m2f2c4(1−v2/c2)[ in massive particle : f2(1−v2/c2) = 1→E2−P2c2=mo2c4
andm/negationslash= 0]&[ in non-massive particle : v2=c2→(1−v2/c2) = 0→E2−P2c2= 0 and m/negationslash= 0]
In special relativity there are 3 types of masses: rest mass ( mo) intrinsic mass ( m) and relativistic mass (m)
2The Newtonian Kinematics
The special position ( ¯r) the special velocity ( ¯v) and the special acceleration ( ¯a) of a particle
( massive or non-massive ) are given by:
¯r.=r (13)
¯v.=d¯r
dt=v (14)
¯a.=d¯v
dt=a (15)
where ( r) is the position of the particle, ( v) is the velocity of the particle, ( a) is the
acceleration of the particle, and ( t) is the ( coordinate ) time.
The Newtonian Dynamics
If we consider a particle ( massive or non-massive ) with intrinsic mass ( m) then the
linear momentum ( P) of the particle, the angular momentum ( L) of the particle, the net
Newtonian force ( FN) acting on the particle, the work ( W ) done by the net Newtonian force
acting on the particle, and the kinetic energy ( K ) of the particle, are given by:

where ( r,v,a,¯v,¯a) are the position, the velocity, the acceleration, the special velocity and
the special acceleration of the particle, ( t) is the ( coordinate ) time, and ( c) is the speed
of light in vacuum. The kinetic energy ( K o) of a massive particle at rest is zero, and the
ordinary acceleration ( a) of a massive or non-massive particle is also always in the direction
of the net Newtonian force ( FN) acting on the particle.
In special relativity, the net Newtonian force ( FN) acting on a massive or non-massive
particle, is given by : FN.=N−1·FE, where ( N) is the Newton tensor, and ( FE) is the
net Einsteinian force acting on the massive or non-massive particle [ 2 ]

(23)
where ( f) is the relativistic factor of the particle, ( r) is the position of the particle, ( v) is
the velocity of the particle, and ( τ) is the proper time of the particle ( Note : dτ=f−1dt)
The Poincarian Dynamics
If we consider a particle ( massive or non-massive ) with intrinsic mass ( m) then the
linear momentum ( P) of the particle, the angular momentum ( L) of the particle, the net
Poincarian force ( FP) acting on the particle, the work ( W ) done by the net Poincarian force
acting on the particle, and the kinetic energy ( K ) of the particle, are given by:
P.=m¯v=m fv (24)
L.=r×P=mr×¯v=m fr×v (25)

where ( f,r,v, τ,¯v,¯a) are the relativistic factor, the position, the velocity, the proper time,
the special velocity and the special acceleration of the particle, and ( c) is the speed of light
in vacuum. The kinetic energy ( K o) of a massive particle at rest is ( moc2) since also in
this dynamics the relativistic energy ( E.=moc2(f−1 ) + moc2) and the kinetic energy
( K.=m f c2) are the same ( E = K )
In special relativity, the net Poincarian force ( FP) acting on a massive or non-massive particle
is given by : FP.=fFE, where ( f) is the relativistic factor of the particle, and ( FE) is
the net Einsteinian force acting on the massive or non-massive particle [ 3 ]
4The Møllerian Kinematics

where ( f) is the relativistic factor of the particle, ( r,v,a) are the position, the velocity and
the acceleration of the particle, and ( τ) is the proper time of the particle ( Note : dτ=f−1dt)
The Møllerian Dynamics
If we consider a particle ( massive or non-massive ) with intrinsic mass ( m) then the linear
momentum ( P) of the particle, the angular momentum ( L) of the particle, the net Møllerian
force ( FM) acting on the particle, the work ( W ) done by the net Møllerian force acting on
the particle, and the kinetic energy ( K ) of the particle, are given by:

the proper time, the special velocity and the special acceleration of the particle, and ( c) is
the speed of light in vacuum. The kinetic energy ( K o) of a massive particle at rest is zero,
and the ordinary acceleration ( a) of a massive or non-massive particle is also always in the
direction of the net Møllerian force ( FM) acting on the particle.
In special relativity, the net Møllerian force ( FM) acting on a massive or non-massive particle
is given by : FM.=M·FE, where ( M) is the Møller tensor, and ( FE) is the net Einsteinian
force acting on the massive or non-massive particle (see Annex I)[ 4 ]
5General Observations
In special relativity, the net forces [ FN,FP,FM] are valid since these net forces are obtained
from the net Einsteinian force [ FE]
Therefore, the net forces [ FE,FN,FP,FM] can be applied in any inertial reference frame.
The special acceleration ( ¯a) of a particle (massive or non-massive) is always in the direction
of the net forces [ FE,FN,FP,FM] acting on the particle (as in Newton’s second law)
Additionally, the ordinary acceleration ( a) of a particle (massive or non-massive) is also
always in the direction of the net forces [ FN,FM] acting on the particle (exactly as in
Newton’s second law) ( Note :FN=f−1FM=f−1M·FE)
The net forces [ FE,FN,FP,FM] are three-forces ( that is, they are three-dimensional vectors )
On the other hand, the net Minkowskian four-force [ FM] is obtained from the four-momentum
and the proper time of a massive particle. In addition, the net Einsteinian four-force [ FE]
can be obtained from the four-momentum and the ( coordinate ) time of a massive particle
(Note :FE= ( ( dE/dt)c−1,FE) and FM=fFE) [ see : Appendix Aand Appendix B]
In special relativity, there are three types of masses that are compatible with each other : the
rest mass ( mo) the intrinsic mass ( m) and the relativistic mass ( m ) ( the intrinsic mass
(m) is an invariant mass that can be applied to massive and non-massive particles )
In the Poincarian dynamics, the deﬁnition of work ( W ) is modiﬁed so that the magnitudes
(P,K ) match the magnitudes ( P,K ) of the Einsteinian dynamics.
In the Møllerian dynamics, the deﬁnition of work ( W ) is modiﬁed so that the magnitudes
(P,K ) match the magnitudes ( P,K ) of the Newtonian dynamics.
Additionally, in relativistic elastic collisions ( or relativistic elastic shocks ) between massive
and/or non-massive particles of an isolated system, the magnitudes ( P=/summationtextmifivi) and
(K =/summationtextmific2) are conserved [and the net Einsteinian force ( FE=dP/dt) is always zero]

The Kinetic Forces
The kinetic force Ka

with intrinsic mass mj, is given by:
Ka

(45)
where ¯aiis the special acceleration of particle i,¯ajis the special acceleration of particle j
andM( =PAll
zmz)is the sum of the intrinsic masses of all the particles of the Universe.
On the other hand, the kinetic force Ku
iexerted on a particle iwith intrinsic mass miby
the Universe, is given by:
Ku
i=−mi/summationtextAll
zmz¯az/summationtextAll
zmz(46)
where mzand¯azare the intrinsic mass and the special acceleration of the z-th particle of
the Universe.
From the above equations it follows that the net kinetic force Ki( =PAll
jKa
ij+Ku
i)acting
on a particle iwith intrinsic mass mi, is given by:
Ki=−mi¯ai (47)
where ¯aiis the special acceleration of particle i.
Now, from all dynamics [ (10) ,(18) ,(26) ,(34)] we have:
Fi=mi¯ai (48)
Since (Ki=−mi¯ai)we obtain:
Fi=−Ki (49)
that is:
Ki+Fi= 0 (50)
If(Ti.=Ki+Fi)then:
Ti= 0 (51)
Therefore, if the net kinetic force Kiis added in all dynamics then the total force Tiacting
on a ( massive or non-massive ) particle iis always zero.
Note : According to this paper, the kinetic forcesau
Kare directly related to kinetic energy K.
