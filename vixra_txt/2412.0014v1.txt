Abstract
】
Objective:
This
study
aims
to
reanalyze
the
essence
of
nuclear
force
and
elucidate
the
genuine
structure
of
atomic
nuclei.
Method:
We
employ
an
approach
that
encompasses
the
examination
of
nuclear
mass
loss,
sub-nucleon
constituents
and
dynamic
nucleus
behavior.
Conclusion:
Our
findings
challenge
the
conventional
view
of
nuclear
forces
as
fundamental
forces
and
propose
a
dynamic
crystal-like
structure
for
atomic
nuclei.

In
the
realm
of
theoretical
physics,
amidst
the
intricate
and
elegant
theories
like
the
Standard
Model,
questions
and
reflections
persist
within
the
scientific
community.
Notably,
Professor
Wang
Lingjun
at
the
University
of
Tennessee
has
been
an
outspoken
critic
and
has
recently
articulated
his
concerns
in
the
paper
titled
"Proposal
to
the
Chinese
Physics
Community"
[1].
It
is
worth
mentioning
that
Professor
Li
Zhengdao
(Tsung-Dao
Lee)
was
among
the
first
to
voice
subtle
criticisms
of
particle
physics.
In
his
book
"Fields
and
Particles,"
Professor
Li
made
a
thought-provoking
comment
on
the
Standard
Model
of
unified
gauge
theory.
He
pointed
out
that
this
theory
demands
about
20
parameters,
encompassing
various
mass
values
and
weak
decay
angles.
Such
a
profusion
of
parameters
raised
the
question
of
whether
our
existing
theories
are
fundamentally
phenomenological.
This
paper
explores
the
implications
of
this
critique.
The
requirement
of
about
20
free-fitting
parameters
in
a
scientific
theory
raises
significant
questions
about
its
validity.
This
number
of
parameters
far
exceeds
what
is
typically
considered
a
sound
and
robust
scientific
theory.
To
put
this
into
perspective,
it
is
reminiscent
of
John
von
Neumann's
quip
that
"With
four
parameters,
I
can
fit
an
elephant,
and
with
five,
I
can
make
him
wiggle
his
trunk."
The
presence
of
20
free
parameters
in
the
Standard
Model
leads
to
remarkable,
almost
fantastical
consequences.
These
parameters,
while
seemingly
arbitrary,
manage
to
account
for
a
wide
array
of
phenomena,
from
neutrino
oscillations
to
quark
oscillations
or
mixing,
Cabibbo
or
CKM
Mixing,
and
even
dark
matter
and
dark
energy.
This
proliferation
of
parameters
transforms
scientific
theory
into
an
intricate
mathematical
puzzle.
Critically,
any
scientist
versed
in
statistics
and
mathematical
modeling
would
recognize
that
a
theory
relying
on
20
free-fitting
parameters
is
fundamentally
flawed
and
lacks
scientific
rigor.
Professor
Li
Zhengdao's
comment,
"Who
has
ever
heard
of
it,"
underscores
the
incredulity
that
such
a
theory
could
be
regarded
as
a
fundamental
description
of
nature.Professor
Li
Zhengdao's
critique
of
the
Standard
Model
strikes
at
the
heart
of
its
credibility.
This
critique
is
not
contingent
on
a
deep
understanding
of
the
theory's
intricacies
or
a
background
in
quantum
field
theory;
it
hinges
on
the
common-sense
understanding
that
a
theory
laden
with
20
free
parameters
is,
at
best,
a
mathematical
abstraction.
To
provide
a
more
intuitive
understanding,
we
take
one
recent
paper
as
an
example.
The
paper
is
by
Wu
Yueliang,
a
professor
at
the
University
of
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences.
Wu
is
also
a
researcher
at
the
Asia-Pacific
International
Center
for
Theoretical
Physics
and
the
Institute
of
Theoretical
Physics
of
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences.
In
this
paper
Wu
proposed
what’s
being
referred
to
as
a
breakthrough
in
the
quest
to
uncover
Einstein's
unified
field
theory:
super
unified
field
theory

The
large
number
of
parameters
directly
contradicts
with
the
principle
that
"the
universe
is
simple
and
elegant".
This
principle
has
been
recognized
and
pursued
by
many
scientists
such
as
Einstein,
illustrated
by
his
quote
“nature
itself
is
concise,
orderly,
highly
generalized,
harmonious
and
unified,
and
governed
by
extremely
beautiful
and
simple
laws”.
If
one
aspires
to
unravel
the
enigmas
within
the
realms
of
particle
physics
and
atomic
nuclei,
the
Standard
Model
will
assuredly
captivate
and
perplex
the
inquirer
with
its
complex,
profound
and
brilliant
mathematical
formulations.
In
addition
to
often
making
up
for
the
flaws
by
refitting
parameters
or
theories,
it
also
shies
away
from
the
fact
that
the
Standard
Model
itself
is
shaken
up
within
its
own
system
by
the
discovery
of
neutrio’s
rest
mass
which
has
been
proved
decisively.
Moreover,
the
scientific
spirit
was
abandoned
with
infinite
amplification
of
the
decay
time
of
"free
protons"
to
10
31~36
years.
To
put
that
into
perspective,
the
age
of
Earth
has
been
estimated
to
be
on
the
magnitude
of
10
10
years.
There
have
been
many
unanswered
questions,
such
as
why
protons
are
so
stable,
while
the
neutrons’
lifetime
is
less
than
10
3
seconds,
given
that
neutrons
and
protons
are
both
composed
of
three
“quarks”,
which
have
never
been
observed
in
the
laboratory,
bound
by
the
strong
force
between
quarks.
And
by
contrast,
all
other
microscopic
particles
(gluons,
mesons,
etc.
except
photons)
have
a
lifetime
of
only
10
-10
~10
-8
seconds
(a
few
seconds
for
the
W
boson).
Not
a
single
case
of
free
proton
decay
has
been
observed,
while
it
can
be
easily
observed
in
the
nucleus.
Furthermore,
if
charge-neutral
photons
mediate
the
electromagnetic
force,
how
do
they
distinguish
between
opposite
charges
and
same
charges
to
generate
attraction
and
repulsion
respectively?
Similarly,
how
can
"gluons",
which
have
not
been
directly
observed
so
far,
mediating
strong
force
and
"gravitons",
which
also
have
not
been
directly
observed,
mediating
gravitation
produce
only
attractive
force
but
no
repulsive
force?
In
fact,
the
fault
lies
in
the
structure
of
the
atomic
nucleus
and
the
so-called
strong
and
weak
forces!
We
propose
the
following
theory:
there
are
no
neutrons
and
protons
in
the
nucleus,
and
there
is
no
so-called
"fundamental
force",
the
strong
force
(nuclear
force)
or
the
weak
force.
We
start
our
analysis
with
deuterons
(D),
which
can
be
split
into
protons
and
neutrons
under
strong
γ-
ray
irradiation
(energy
≥
2.22
MeV).
On
the
contrary,
when
protons
and
neutrons
form
deuterons,
they
will
release
2.22
MeV
energy
in
the
form
of
photons.
The
reaction
is:
p+n
－
D+
γ
The
Standard
Model
believes
that
there
is
a
strong
force
(nuclear
force)
in
the
nucleus.
To
disassemble
the
nucleus,
one
needs
to
overcome
the
nuclear
force
with
huge
energy.
The
implication
is
that
if
the
deuteron
is
like
two
strong
magnets
attracting
together,
and
this
attracting
force
is
the
strong
force.
If
it
is
indeed
the
case,
then
this
"force"
appears
to
have
"negative
mass",
because
that
the
mass
of
a
deuteron
is
less
than
the
sum
of
mass
of
a
proton
and
a
neutron.
With
the
same
analogy,
there
is
attraction
force
between
two
magnets
m
1
and
m
2
.
And
it
takes
work
or
energy
to
separate
them.
So
will
their
respective
masses
increase
if
they
are
separated?
Do
they
lose
mass
when
they're
close
together?
The
answers
are
of
course
no.
However,
exceptional
things
still
happened,
and
the
"strong
force"
was
artificially
"created".
Apparently,
scientists
imagined
deuterium
nuclei
as
two
independently
attracted
spheres,
when
in
reality
they
are
not.
See
below.Schematic
diagram
of
proton
and
neutron
synthesis
of
deuteron
In
the
deuteron
(in
fact,
all
nuclei
are
the
same),
there
are
actually
no
independent
protons
and
neutrons
that
"maintain
the
original
mass"
(and
then
attract
each
other
by
nuclear
force).
There
are
only
"quasi-neutrons"
and
"quasi-protons"
whose
masses
are
smaller
than
those
of
free
protons
and
neutrons.
And
the
deficient
mass
radiates
as
gamma
rays.
The
specific
process
of
the
above-mentioned
deuterium
synthesis
is
actually
as
following:
High-energy
protons
and
neutrons
collide
and
"submerge"
when
they
are
extremely
close
to
each
other—that
is,
the
overlapping
state
in
the
above
diagram.
That
is
actually
like
hydrogen
molecular
ions——H
2
+
ions
(two
H
atoms
share
an
electron
cloud,
the
radius
is
reduced).
However
the
force
is
different.
Although
the
H
2
+
ions
can
exist
stably,
just
like
the
deuterium
nuclei,
there
are
no
molecules
or
ions
with
more
than
2
hydrogen
atoms
such
as
H
3
.
This
does
not
agree
with
the
existence
of
the
nucleus
of
high
nucleon
numbers
as
the
3-118
elements.
Regarding
how
to
unlock
the
mechanism,
in
fact,
scientists
have
already
discovered
in
the
process
of
stellar
evolution
that
there
are
many
mechanisms
for
neutrino
pairs
to
be
produced
in
the
late
stage
of
stellar
evolution,
such
as
the
Yucca
process,
neutrino
bremsstrahlung,
photogenerated
neutrino
process,
electron
pair
annihilation
neutrino
process
and
the
plasmon
decay
neutrino
process,
etc.
All
processes
are
actually
ultimately
just
one
of
the
two
cases,
a
neutron
or
a
photon
decays
into
a
neutrino
pair:
n/
γ→+
+υ
This
decay
phenomenon
of
photons,
which
can
also
decay
into
positron-electron
pairs,
is
well
known
in
the
scientific
community.
However,
this
process
in
neutrons
has
not
been
directly
observed.
It
is
obviously
true
for
both
the
Yucca
process
and
the
neutrino
bremsstrahlung
process!
Therefore
neutrons
can
“decay”
into
gamma
photons.
Moreover,
the
generated
neutrino
pairs
obviously
cannot
be
electron-type
at
the
beginning,
but
neutron-type
neutrino
pairs
or
inert
neutrinos,
which
is
generally
considered
unlikely
to
exist
.
Coming
back
to
the
neutron
structure.
Is
it
really
composed
of
three
quarks
as
stated
in
modern
particle
physics?
Just
like
the
proton
is
also
composed
of
three
quarks?
In
fact,
although
this
kind
of
understanding
is
mainstream,
it
cannot
withstand
scrutiny
at
all!
As
mentioned
above,
protons
and
neutrons,
which
are
both
composed
of
three
quarks,
have
infinitely
different
lifetimes.
In
fact,
neutrons
are
not
so
complicated,
and
protons
are
so
simple,
but
atomic
nuclei
are
not
so
simple.
From
the
perspective
of
any
microscopic
nuclear
reaction
related
to
neutrons
and
protons,
neutrons
are
actually
unstable
structures
composed
of
protons,
electrons
and
antineutrinos,
which
explains
that
they
can
decay!
Their
lifetime
is
at
least
in
the
order
of
10
3
seconds,
which
is
within
the
range
of
normal
observation
of
human
beings.
The
others
whose
half-lives
are
in
the
order
of
10
-10
~10
-8
seconds,
strictly
speaking,
are
kind
of
resonant
states.
And
they
cannot
be
regarded
as
elementary
particles.
At
most
they
can
be
regarded
as
transition
states.
The
half-life
of
real
material
elements
should
be
greater
than
that
of
neutrons!
The
structure
of
the
atomic
nucleus
can
be
analyzed
and
deducted
with
the
knowledge
of
the
decay
products
of
neutrons.
Simply
put,
based
on
the
result
of
neutron
free
decay,
neutrons
are
unstable
structures
composed
of
protons,
electrons
and
antineutrinos!
The
neutron
structure
diagram
is
as
following:
Schematic
diagram
of
neutron
structure
Let's
analyze
the
following
process
of
producing
neutrons:
e
+
p→n
+
e
+
.
This
reaction
is
enough
to
reveal
the
internal
structure
of
neutrons.
when
high
energy
antineutrino
e
collides
with
p,
e
hits
the
edge
of
the
proton
(certainly
below
the
Fermi
surface
of
the
electron)
with
high
energy.
The
huge
energy
(kinetic
energy
excited
as
excitons)
disintegrates
into
positive
and
negative
electrons,
of
which
the
positrons
are
instantly
ejected,
and
the
electrons
are
captured
by
the
protons.
At
the
same
time,
the
speed
of
e
drops
suddenly,
and
it
instantly
becomes
an
"inert
antineutrino"
n
——In
fact,
due
to
decelerating,
part
of
the
kinetic
energy
has
been
transformed
into
mass.
n
is
then
captured
by
the
electrons,
which
have
been
captured
by
the
proton
earlier
(because
the
magnetic
force
is
dominant).
Then
both
e
and
the
electron
surround
the
proton
together.
The
electron
and
the
surrounding
inert
neutrino
actually
form
a
new
particle,
a
W
-
boson,
as
scientists
call
it.
Therefore
the
scientific
community
can
observe
the
W
-
→e
+υ
e
decay
reaction!
It
is
well
known
that
although
neutrinos
are
charge
neutral,
they
have
magnetic
moments
and
can
interact
with
magnetic
fields.
Therefore
they
can
exist
in
the
orbit
of
electrons
whose
spins
generate
magnetic
fields.
However,
we
have
not
estimated
the
mass
of
inert
neutrinos
yet.
Since
the
mass
of
neutrons,
protons
and
electrons
are
1.6749,
1.6726
and
0.0009109
x
10
-27
kg
respectively,
it
can
be
deducted
that
the
mass
of
the
inert
neutrino
is
about
0.0013891
x
10
-27
kg,
which
is
52%
larger
than
the
mass
of
electrons!
The
instability
of
the
electron
itself
(thermal
motion)
and
the
influence
of
gravity
lead
to
serious
instability
of
the
system.
Therefore
the
half-life
of
W
-
is
only
about
3
seconds.
Of
course,
W
-
particles
are
not
as
outrageous
as
scientists
say.
Their
mass
is
claimed
to
be
a
hundred
times
that
of
protons,
and
at
the
same
time
they
can
decay
into
electrons
and
neutrinos,
with
the
mass
of
electrons
being
only
1/1836
of
protons.
However,
in
the
neutron
regime,
W
-
half-life
is
much
longer
than
3
seconds.
Once
they
form
a
whole
system
with
protons,
due
to
the
influences
of
the
strong
Coulomb
force
and
the
proton’s
magnetic
field,
the
electrons
tend
to
be
stable
(spin
stability,
revolution
stability).
And
the
neutrinos
also
tend
to
be
stable
under
the
influence
of
the
two
magnetic
fields.
Therefore
the
whole
system
is
stable.
However,
because
the
heavier
"inert
antineutrinos"
revolve
around
the
lighter
electrons,
although
the
gravitational
force
is
extremely
weak
relative
to
the
Coulomb
force,
in
the
electron-neutrino
system,
the
effects
of
the
magnetic
force
and
gravitational
force,
which
are
dominated
by
masses,
will
be
slowly
revealed.
The
initial
circular
orbit
of
electrons
will
gradually
have
waves,
and
the
amplitude
will
gradually
increase,
which
interferes
with
the
stability
of
electrons
moving
around
protons.
The
electrons
will
accumulate
"shaking"
and
change
the
orbit,
until
eventually
lose
their
balance
and
fly
away
from
the
protons.
In
this
way,
the
system
collapses
and
the
"inert
antineutrinos"
fly
away
naturally—speeding
up
to
the
speed
of
light
and
becoming
electron
neutrinos
e
.
Since
the
mass
decreases,
the
loss
of
mass
turns
into
kinetic
energy.
In
fact,
this
is
the
so-called
"neutrino
redshift",
which
is
not
a
neutrino
oscillation
at
all.
The
three
flavors
of
neutrinos
are
actually
similar
to
the
visible
light,
i.e.
they
are
actually
three
bands
(mass
bands)
with
similar
properties.
Neutrinos
are
actually
micro-neutrons
(strictly
speaking,
they
are
miniaturized
hydrogen
atoms).
The
electric
charge
and
mass
are
polarized.
For
example,
the
outside
of
anti-neutrinos
is
charge
positive,
so
it
has
a
micro-attraction
effect
with
electrons!
Therefore,
an
external
magnetic
field
can
produce
a
non-uniform
shift
of
its
charges
and
create
a
magnetic
moment,
which
is
why
we
can
observe
that
neutrinos
can
deflect
in
a
magnetic
field.
This
is
the
reason
why
neutrons
are
unstable
and
can
decay
(the
half
decay
time
can
be
calculated
per
the
model
described
so
far).
It
is
also
the
reason
why
all
radioactive
elements
can
decay
.
The
reasons
why
the
half-lives
are
different
are
1)
that
the
redundant
neutrons
in
the
nucleus
are
in
an
"unstable"
state,
2)
that
the
different
synergistic
resonances
cause
different
structures
and
thus
different
nucleus
stabilities.
This
situation
is
similar
to
the
solar
system
(the
sun,
earth
and
moon).
The
reason
for
the
stability
of
this
system
at
present:
one
is
that
the
system
relatively
simple
gravitational
system;
and
the
other
is
that
the
moon
moves
very
slowly,
whose
mass
is
one-sixth
that
of
the
earth,
and
it
is
far
away
from
the
earth,
which
has
little
influence
on
the
orbital
stability
of
the
earth.
Its
gravitational
force
is
also
uniformly
dissolved
by
the
soft
mantle
of
the
earth
and
the
excess
seawater—the
formation
of
tides
(the
fluid
tide
of
the
mantle
and
the
liquid
tide
of
seawater)
will
decompose
the
force,
so
there
is
no
accumulation
and
superposition
effect
to
cause
the
acceleration
of
the
earth.
Now
we
go
back
to
the
analysis
of
the
formation
of
deuterons:
when
protons
and
neutrons
（
p
W
-
）
collide
with
each
other,
their
speed
drops
to
0
instantaneously
(fusion),
and
the
so-called
"excitons''
will
be
produced
by
the
huge
kinetic
energy
.
The
excitons
will
transition
locally
to
γ
photon.
And
the
γ
photons
bounce
off
and
excite
protons
p
to
n+
W
+
(In
fact,
it
is
equivalent
to
dual
photons
generating
positive
and
negative
neutrino
pairs
and
electron
pairs).
Then
the
W
+
will
annihilate
with
the
W
-
in
the
neutron
and
become
a
new
γ
,
with
the
original
neutron
n
having
decayed
to
a
proton
p
.
Then
the
process
repeats,
with
the
new
γ
bombarding
the
new
proton,
and
so
on.
That
is
to
say,
the
γ
photon
acts
as
a
catalyst
to
interconvert
protons
and
neutrons.
In
this
context,
we
understand
what
the
essence
of
the
so-called
strong
force
(nuclear
force)
is:
the
exchange
of
W
+
and
W
-
between
neutrons
and
protons,
under
the
catalysis
of
photons.
On
the
other
hand,
the
so-called
weak
force
is
actually
the
combined
force
of
electrons
and
the
inert
neutrino
system
(the
original
W
-
bosons).
Therefore,
they
are
not
fundamental
forces
at
all.
Notably,
we
do
not
see
traces
of
the
so-called
mass
loss.
In
fact,
when
the
γ
photon
excites
the
proton
p,
there
is
a
large
mass
loss,
which
results
in
the
radiation
of
the
new
high
energy
γ
photon.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
large-scale
collision
experiments
of
particle
physics,
the
so-called
new
particles
produced
are
actually
fragments
and
short-lived
resonance
states.
This
is
why
scientists
can't
observe
free
proton
decay
at
all,
but
can
observe
proton
"decay"
in
the
nucleus,
which
is
actually
not
decay
but
“enlargement”.
Due
to
the
principle
of
energy
conservation
and
the
fact
that
protons
have
less
mass
than
neutrons,
protons
can
not
“decay”
into
neutrons.
Therefore,
in
the
deuteron:
1)
it
is
impossible
to
have
protons
and
neutrons
that
retain
the
original
masses,
but
quasi-protons
and
quasi-neutrons;
2)
there
are
no
fixed
"quasi-protons"
and
"quasi-neutrons"
,
but
the
two
are
in
a
state
of
mutual
exchange!
Such
interconversion
is
produced
by
the
fact
that
excitation
of
protons
by
photons
generate
W
+
which
annihilate
with
the
W
-
in
the
neutron
into
new
photons.
Deuterons
can
actually
be
expressed
as
the
following
states:Deuteron
dynamic
change
diagram
(Western
Mode
and
Eastern
Mode)
It
is
similar
to
the
interaction
between
the
two
H
atoms
in
the
H2
molecule
(covalent
bond,
van
der
Waals
force).
Instead
of
a
shared
electron
pair,
two
photons
and
positive
and
negative
W
boson
pairs
are
shared.
So
far
we
know
that
the
"quasi-protons"
and
"quasi-neutrons"
in
deuterons
are
actually
not
fixed,
but
are
always
interconverting
to
each
other.
Because
the
binding
energy
of
each
atom
is
different,
the
masses
of
the
quasi-protons
and
the
quasi-neutrons
are
also
not
fixed.
The
greater
the
binding
energy,
the
lower
the
masses.
The
corresponding
photon
energy
is
also
different.
The
system
is
in
a
state
of
"self-sufficiency"
and
mutual
integration
and
transformation.
When
the
deuteron
accepts
another
neutron,
it
becomes
tritium
3
H.
Since
the
neutron
has
a
similar
structure
to
the
H
atom,
the
two
neutrons
can
interact
weakly
(more
like
van
der
Waals
forces
between
molecules),
but
are
unstable.
However,
they
will
fight
for
gamma
photons
inside
the
deuteron.
Therefore
a
triton
is
equivalent
to
two
quasi-neutrons
and
one
quasi-proton
sharing
a
pair
of
gamma
photons
(moving
back
and
forth).
It
is
similar
to
the
conjugate
π
bond
in
chemical
systems.
Actually
it
is
a
“nuclear
π
3
1
bond”.
Also
there
is
always
a
quasi-neutron
that
is
relatively
free.
Therefore
tritium
is
unstable
and
radioactive
(half-life
is
12.43
years).
If
a
deuteron
accepts
a
proton,
it
forms
3
He,
which
is
equivalent
to
one
quasi-neutron
and
two
quasi-proton
sharing
a
γ.
It
is
also
a
“nuclear
π
3
1
bond”.
However
the
relatively
free
quasi-particles
are
relatively
stable
quasi-protons.
Therefore
they
are
very
stable.
And
two-deuterium
binding
is
4
He,
which
is
equivalent
to
two
quasi-protons
and
two
quasi-neutrons
spaced
and
sharing
four
gamma
photons
in
cycles.
Therefore
it
is
more
stable.
See
figures
below.
By
analogy,
it
seems
that
the
larger
nuclei
are
“nucleon
rings".
Although
their
shapes
may
vary
widely,
there
should
be
patterns
to
be
found.
The
rings
could
spin.
The
quasi-neutrons
and
quasi-protons
are
spaced
from
each
other.
Two
quasi-neutrons
can
appear
next
to
each
other.
The
connection
is
similar
to
the
weak
effect
of
van
der
Waals
force
between
molecules,
but
must
be
greater
than
the
tension
of
the
nucleon
ring.
Also
the
fusion
period
must
be
longer
than
the
neutron
lifetime
for
the
connection
to
be
relatively
stable.
However
there
will
not
be
two
quasi-protons
connected
because
the
Coulomb's
force
is
too
large.
It
is
the
cyclic
interconversions
that
make
this
kind
of
nucleus
structures
stable,
just
like
the
conjugated
benzene
rings.
However,
just
as
atoms
generally
can
only
form
stable
rings
of
five
or
six
atoms,
atomic
nuclei
may
only
form
stable
ring
structures
with
five
or
six
nucleons.
However,
for
artificially
synthesized
multi-neutron
elements
such
as
helium
5
and
helium
6,
since
the
force
between
neutrons,
which
is
derived
from
the
Coulomb
force
between
protons,
is
much
smaller
than
the
tension
of
the
nucleon-ring,
they
are
actually
not
stable.
Strictly
speaking
they
do
not
exist.
They
are
only
resonance
states,
not
basic
elements.
Anything
with
a
lifetime
less
than
that
of
neutrons
is
not
an
element.
As
for
tritium,
although
it
has
only
two
quasi-neutrons,
it
can
not
form
a
ring,
therefore
it
is
unstable
and
can
decay.
In
fact,
since
W
+
and
W
-
are
structures
composed
of
positrons/neutrinos
and
electrons/antineutrinos
respectively,
a
"deuterium
unit"
(i.e.,
a
pair
of
quasi-neutrons
and
quasi-proton)
can
be
split
into
four
interacting
angles,
namely,
positrons,
neutrinos,
electrons,
and
antineutrinos,
which
can
be
used
to
combine
with
adjacent
"deuterium
units'
via
inter-annihilation
producing
dual
gamma
photons.
Therefore
complex
multi-nucleon
structures
similar
to
diamond-like
multi-carbon
structures
can
be
formed.
We
can
consider
them
as
deuteron
crystals,
with
the
four
interacting
angles
just
like
the
sp3
hybrid
orbitals
of
carbon
atoms.
The
extra
neutrons
can
be
embedded
outside
it
as
an
unstable
structure.
Below
certain
quantities,
it
can
maintain
a
stable
structure.
But
beyond
certain
quantities,
it
becomes
unstable.
Nuclei
with
large
nuclear
numbers
are
actually
deuterons
(their
masses
are
different
in
different
nuclei)
in
the
diamond-like
structure.
There
are
no
"basic
forces"
nucleons.
Rather
they
are
in
a
state
of
lively
change,
self-sufficiency,
mutual
integration
and
mutual
transformation.
Based
on
this,
there
is
a
connection,
which
can
be
named
"nuclear
range
force",
but
not
a
fundamental
force.

Schematic
diagram
of
the
dynamics
of
nucleon
rings
As
can
be
seen
from
the
figure,
the
structure
of
atomic
nuclei
(except
helium
3)
can
be
expressed
as
follows:
x(pn)y(pn
2
)z(pn
3
),
where
pn
is
a
stable
structure,
regardless
of
the
value
of
x;
pn
2
is
a
sub-stable
structure,
which
becomes
more
unstable
with
the
increase
of
the
y
value
(relatively
small
and
stable);
while
the
z
value
is
small,
and
pn
3
is
an
extremely
unstable
structure,
which
belongs
to
the
synthetic
category
(actually
it
cannot
be
called
a
basic
element,
but
only
a
transitional
resonance
state,
which
does
not
exist
in
natural
elements).
In
fact,
with
the
knowledge
of
the
neutron-related
internal
cause
in
nuclei
decay,
we
can
not
call
elements
with
a
half-life
shorter
than
that
of
neutrons
basic
elements
at
all.
Therefore,
the
natural
(or
synthetic
with
half-life
greater
than
neutron)
elemental
structure
is
x(pn)y(pn
2
).
This
structure
can
explain
the
law
of
fission
of
many
radioactive
elements.
With
the
knowledge
of
the
true
structural
state
of
the
atomic
nucleus,
the
mystery
of
quasars,
which
has
puzzled
the
physics
community
for
many
years,
might
be
easy
to
unravel.
Also
there
could
be
a
breakthrough
in
synthesizing
stable
heavy
nuclei.
This
could
lead
to
the
study
of
the
real
physical
and
chemical
properties
of
heavy
elements.
Precious
metals
such
as
gold
and
platinum
could
be
simply
synthesized!
Special
existences
in
nature
are
enough
to
prove
the
possibility
of
this
synthesis,
such
as
the
existence
of
the
asteroid
2011
UW-158
containing
100
million
tons
of
platinum
and
the
Cancer
K
Star
with
at
least
100
billion
tons
of
gold
on
the
surface.
Such
a
huge
amount
of
platinum
and
gold
is
impossible
from
accidental
external
capture.
And
the
success
of
this
new
synthetic
method
to
create
stable
heavy
elements
can
in
turn
prove
the
correctness
of
the
above
atomic
nucleus
structure
theory.
Eventually
the
evolution
model
of
the
universe
and
galaxies
will
be
more
perfect.
