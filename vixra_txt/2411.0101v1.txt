AN INEQUALITY FOR A SLICE OF ANY COMPACT SET
JOHAN ASPEGREN
Abstract. In this paper we will prove that if a compact AinRnbelongs to
the unit ball in Rn, then Ahas a slice of measure greater than a calculable
constant times the measure of A. Our result is sharp.
1.Introduction
In this paper we prove a very general theorem. Often these kind of questions are
studied in the convex special case [1]. Our main theorem is the following.
Theorem 1.1. LetA⊂Bn(0,1)⊂Rnbe compact. Let γbe such that
µn(A) =Z
B(0,1)γnµ.
Then
max
e∈Rnµn−1(K∩He)≥γnµn−1(Bn−1(0,1)).
A sharp case is the unit ball obviously. We can state our result for compact sets
A⊂Bn(0,1) contained in the unit ball as
(1.1)max
e∈Rnµn−1(A∩He)≥γnµn−1(Bn−1(0,1))
=µn−1(Bn−1(0,1))
µn(Bn(0,1))µn(Bn(0, γ))
=µn−1(Bn−1(0,1))
µn(Bn(0,1))µn(A).
IfA⊂B(0, R),then we have
(1.2)max
e∈Rnµn−1(A∩He)≥µn−1(Bn−1(0, R))
µn(Bn(0, R))µn(A)
=1
Rµn−1(Bn−1(0,1))
µn(Bn(0,1))µn(A)
2.Notation
The term Bn(0, R) means the origin centered ball of radius RinRn. We use the
term Bn−1(0, R) for the origin centered ball of radius RinRn−1.The term Sn−1
means the unit sphere. We use Heto mean n−1-dimensional subspace orthogonal
toe∈Sn−1. For any set B B δmeans the δ-neighbourhood of B: It is the set of
points in Rnsuch that the euclidean distance to Bis strictly less than δ.We use

3.The Proof
Now, for a small δ >0 there is the smallest number Msuch that
(3.1)M−1X
i=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δ)≤µn(B(0,1))≤MX
i=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δ).
Of course, the sets Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δdo not necessarily cover Bn(0,1).Thus, Mis the
suitable natural number such that
(3.2) µn(A) =γn
δMX
i=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δ)
for some density γn
δ.Now, there is a density γnsuch that
(3.3) µn(A) =Z
B(0,1)γnµ,
and then γ≥γδfrom above and from (3.1). It follows from above and from (3.2)
that
(3.4) γnµn(B(0,1)) = µn(A) =γn
δMX
i=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δ).
So in principle γδcan be solved from
(3.5) µn(A) =γn
δMX
i=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δ).
However, we managed to state our theorem in terms of γ.Now, let us suppose
towards a contradiction that for compact A⊂B(0,1) it holds that
(3.6) µn(A∩He
δ)< γn
δµn(Bn(0,1)∩He
δ)
uniformly in e∈Sn.Now, there is a smallest Nsuch that
(3.7) µn(A) =µn([
ei∈Sn−1Bn(0,1)∩Hei)≤NX
j=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hej
δ).
So, the above implies that N≤M, because of A⊂Bn(0,1).Now, from assumption
(3.6), from from N≤M, and from (3.5) we have that
(3.8)
µn(A)≤NX
j=1µn(A∩Hej
δ)<NX
j=1γn
δµn(A∩Hej
δ)≤MX
j=1γn
δµn(A∩Hei
δ) =µn(A),
which is a contradiction. So we have for some e∈Snthat
(3.9) µn(A∩He
δ)≥γn
δµn(Bn(0,1)∩He
δ).
Because Ais compact we can take
max
e∈Snµn(A∩He
δ) =µn(A∩He
δ).AN INEQUALITY FOR A SLICE OF ANY COMPACT SET 3
We have
µn(A∩He
δ) =Zδ
−δµn−1(A∩x+He)dx≤2δmax
−δ≤x≤δµn−1(A∩x+He).
So for a small δwe have
2δmax
−δ≤x≤δµn−1(A∩x+He))≥µn(A∩He
δ)
≥γn
δµn(Bn(0,1)∩He
δ)
≥2δγδµn−1(Bn(0, γδ−cδ)∩He),
where the second to last inequality follows from (3.9) and the last from the geometry
of the ball. Because of the slight curvature of the ball we must include the cδterm.
Thus,
µn−1(A∩He)≥lim inf
δ→0max
−δ≤x≤δµn−1(A∩x+He))≥lim sup
δ→0γδµn−1(Bn(0, γδ−cδ)∩He).
From above it follows that
(3.10) µn−1(A∩He))≥lim sup
δ→0γn
δµn−1(Bn(0,1−cδ
γδ)∩He).
Next, from (3.1) and (3.5) we have that
(3.11) γnM−1X
i=1µnBn(0,1)∩Hei
δ)≤γnµn(B(0,1)) = γn
δMX
i=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δ).
So that
γnMX
i=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δ)≤γn
δMX
i=1µn(Bn(0,1)∩Hei
δ) +µn(Bn(0,1)∩HeM
δ).
Because
lim
δ→0µn(Bn(0,1)∩HeM
δ) = 0 ,
and because γδ≤γ,we have that
lim
δ→0γδ=γ.
So the theorem 1.1 follows from (3.10).
