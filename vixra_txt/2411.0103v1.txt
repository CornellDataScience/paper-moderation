Caption  (Explaining the Graph’s Signi ﬁcance): 
The seasonal pattern in daily sunspot numbers, first documented with a 12-year graph in the 
early 1900s, suggests that Earth’s orbital position significantly influences sunspot formation, 
revealing deeper connections between solar and terrestrial phenomena. Given that sunspots 
are thought to appear on a celestial body 149 million kilometers away and 1.3 million times 
larger than Earth, this seasonality casts further doubt on current Sun-centered sunspot 
theories. This easily reproducible pattern with modern tools, challenges prevailing theories 
and could necessitate substantial revisions in mainstream cosmology, especially regarding 
cosmic influences on Earth and life. Alongside this groundbreaking discovery, Mémery also 
published correlations between sunspots and atmospheric pressure, rainfall, temperature, 
earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions—findings that took decades to be re-discovered. 
More than 50 years later, Louis-Claude Vincent (1906–1988) and Jeanne Rousseau (1910–2012) 
offered a compelling explanation for Mémery’s observations by proposing a cosmic model that 
challenges conventional science. Their interdisciplinary work, spanning astronomy, astrophysics, 
cosmology, climate science and meteorology, seismology, biology and more, provides 
groundbreaking insights into solar astronomy and the Cosmos-Earth connection.

Important : To obtain significant graphs, it is crucial to use the numbers for 
each calendar day and avoid using smoothing   
averages over several days, weeks or month. A key aspect of their research is the correlation between cosmic cycles and terrestrial 
phenomena, such as climate, weather patterns, seismic activity, and biological rhythms. 
This suggests a deeper interaction between cosmic forces and Earth’s systems than 
previously understood, with significant implications for modern science. Vincent and 
Rousseau’s work highlights the importance of studying both cosmic phenomena and 
their practical Earth-bound applications, offering insights that directly impact life on Earth 
and address issues of societal interest.
Their research also transcends the compartmentalization seen in contemporary science. 
By linking geophysics, cosmology, bioelectronics, and biology, they propose an integra -
ted framework that redefines our understanding of natural processes, from solar cycles 
to life’s rhythms on Earth.              Ulrich Schreier November 2024
