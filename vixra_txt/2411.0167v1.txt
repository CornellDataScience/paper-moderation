Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel series for approximating πthat converges
rapidly. Each iteration produces three correct digits of πwith only five terms,
demonstrating a significant improvement in computational efficiency over exist-
ing methods. We compare this series with traditional series such as the Gregory-
Leibniz, Ramanujan, and Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) formulas. Our analysis
shows that the series is computationally simple while maintaining a rapid conver-
gence rate, making it suitable for numerical applications requiring moderate preci-
sion. We explore its potential use in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
1 Introduction
Approximating the mathematical constant πhas been a central problem in both theo-
retical and computational mathematics. Several series have been proposed for this task,
including the well-known Gregory-Leibniz series, which converges very slowly, and the
more rapidly converging series discovered by Srinivasa Ramanujan. Additionally, the
Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) formula allows for the extraction of individual digits of π
in binary, but with a relatively slower overall convergence rate.
In this paper, we introduce a novel series that computes πwith rapid convergence:
it computes three digits of πper five iterations. This result makes the series an efficient
alternative for applications requiring moderate precision in computational settings.
2 The Series
The series under consideration is given by:
S=∞X
k=0−1
4k1
2k+ 1+2
4k+ 1+1
4k+ 3
S=∞X
k=0−1
4k40k2+ 42k+ 10
(2k+ 1)(4 k+ 1)(4 k+ 3).
This series converges rapidly to π, with each iteration producing approximately three
correct digits of π. The terms of the series involve simple powers and polynomials, making
it computationally efficient compared to series that involve factorials or more complex
functions, such as those found in the Ramanujan or BBP formulas.
13 Convergence Analysis
The convergence of this series is notably rapid. As shown in Figure 1, for every 5 terms,
the series produces 3 accurate digits of π. This is a significant improvement over series
like the Gregory-Leibniz series, which converges slowly and requires many more terms to
reach similar precision.
We compare this to the Ramanujan series, which, although extremely fast, involves
complex factorial terms, making it computationally expensive. In contrast, our series
involves only simple polynomial terms, which makes it much easier to compute without
sacrificing much in terms of convergence speed.
4 Numerical Results
We computed the first 10 terms of the series and obtained the following results (rounded
to the first 10 digits of π):

15 3.1415926535 1.4321432928 ×10−11

The results show that after just 15 terms, the approximation is accurate to 9 decimal
places, demonstrating the fast convergence of the series. In comparison, the Gregory-
Leibniz series requires many more terms to reach this level of accuracy.
5 Discussion
This series provides a new method for efficiently calculating π, particularly useful for
applications where moderate precision is sufficient, such as in numerical simulations or
computer graphics. Additionally, the simplicity of the terms makes it suitable for use in
environments with limited computational resources, where more complex series may not
be practical.
Future work could explore potential optimizations to further speed up the convergence
or to explore other constants that could be approximated in a similar manner.
6 Conclusion
In conclusion, we have introduced a novel series for approximating πthat converges
rapidly and efficiently. Every five terms of the series produces three correct digits of
π, making it a valuable tool for applications requiring moderate precision. Future work
could explore generalizations of this method or the development of even faster-converging
series.
