Abstract
A previously unknown relationship involving the masses of the neutron, proton, and electron is
reported. Expressed simply, it statesmn
me≈2π
α(γ−1
γ), where γis defined as ( mn−mp)/me, and
α=e2/(2hcϵ0) represents the fine structure constant. The accuracy of this approximation is 2 .0·10−4,
which is outside the experimental error of 4 .0·10−6. Additionally, the coincidence γ≈log 4πholds,
with an even closer match of 2 .0·10−5, yet still outside the experimental precision of 1 .0·10−6. It is
not claimed that these coincdences have a physical meaning.
Motivation
Inspired by the nuclear electron hypothesis Stuever (1983), one may consider the neutron as a compound
state of a proton and an electron. It is well established that the mass difference between the neutron and
the proton corresponds to approximately 2 .53 electron masses. Thus it is a natural idea to interprete this
number as a relativistic factor γ=1q
1−v2
c2, which implies an approximate velocity of v≈0.918cfor the
electron. Assuming a hypothetical scenario where this relativistic electron orbits the proton (contrary to
Bohr’s quantization rule of angular momentum), equating the centripetal force to Coulomb’s force results
in:
e2
4πϵ0r2=γmev2
r. (1)
Solving for ryields
r=e2
4πϵ0γmev2, (2)
which, after inserting the latest CODATA values, astonishingly closely matches (1 .31933 ·10−15m) the
Compton wavelength of the neutron:
λC=h
mnc= 1.31959 ·10−15m. (3)
However, without invoking the Compton wavelength, the coincidence may be formulated in an even
more simple way. If we again interprete γ:= (mn−mp)/meas relativistic factor, then we can rewrite (1)
with the substitution
v2=c2(1−1
γ2), (4)
which after canceling randγleads to
c2γ2−1
γ=e2
4πmeϵ0r. (5)
1With the additional substitution r=λC=h/(mnc) we derive
1
r=4πmeϵ0c2r
e2γ2−1
γ=1
λC=mnc
h(6)
Using the definition of the fine structure constant α=e2
2ϵ0hcand simplifying, this can be transformed to
mn
me≈2π
α(γ−1
γ). (7)
Despite these observations, the precision of current CODATA values rules out this approximation.
Correction for the proton’s motion in the hypothesized Kepler problem further diminishes the match
(the calculated electron-proton distance would shrink to 1 .31752 ·10−15m), contradicting this simplistic
approach. Moreover, the model of an electron orbiting the proton at relativistic speeds does not account
for potential energy, which in the hydrogen atom is double the kinetic energy with an opposite sign (due to
the virial theorem). Thus, the original motivating hypothesis cannot be physically substantiated, though
it presents a numerically intriguing result worth discussing for potential new insights into the masses of
the neutron, proton, and electron.
The second conicidence to report is very simple:
γ≈log 4π (8)
There seems to be no physical model whatsoever, similar to concidences such asmp
me≈6π6. Though even
more accurate, it will presumably remain without explanation.
Outlook
Coincidences such as the ones mentioned are often dismissed as ‘numerology’. However, history reminds us
that the search for such numerical relationships led Johann Jakob Balmer in 1885 to discover the Rydberg
constant, a pivotal moment in atomic physics. Similarly, the discovery of the relationship ϵ0µ0= 1/c2
by Kirchhoff and Weber revolutionized our understanding and application of electromagnetic theory, cfr.
see Unzicker (2020, 2021). Therefore, these coincidences should be documented. However, establishing
credibility in their physical meaning requires a corresponding theory that quantitatively justifies these
observations.
