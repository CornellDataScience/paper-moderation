Abstract  
There is no direct mathematical tool that enables us to generalize Schwarzschild solution to cases where there is more than 
one source of gravitational field. In  this paper, we  explained that this generalization can be made if we develop  an equivalent 
and parallel description  to the geometric description  based on the metric tensor, and we found that this method succeeds in 
generalizing the Schwarzschild solution for any number of gravitational sources that move relative to each other.  
 
Introduction  and O verview  
The great work that Schwarzschild  accomplished [1] in finding a simple and elegant  relationship between 
space and mat ter has one flaw  which is that the solution he arrived at is very rigid and can only be app lied 
in one ideal case and cannot be dealt with using mathematical tools  such as superposition, integration o r 
statistics to derive solutions for general cases such as the presence of more than one source of 
gravitational fi eld, that is  because  the  metric tensor which represents the variable of gravitational field 
in general relativity cannot be combined by any mathematical too l, given multiple sources of gravity, each 
source corresponding to some metric , the “net metric ” at a given point does not equal the sum of the 
indiv idual metrics of each sources or  any known function  of these metrics. But  the situation  is not 
completely hopeless, as mathematics has many tactics other than these direct tools for  deducing general 
relations from special  and ideal cases. Here , we want to use one of this tactics which is to replace the 
variables of  the relationship of the ideal case with other variables that can be dealt with by mathematical 
tools.  
I want the reader not to rush to criticize the idea through  the issue of whether the new description  
matches rea lity or not, because the intention is not to present an alternative to the geometric description 
based on the metric tensor of the gravitational field, this alternative description is mer ely a mean s to 
perform some mathematical operations and we quickly return to the original descr iption . 
Equivalence of Metric Tensor and Space Flow  
Let's have a polar refe rence system with center O  in a vacuum devoid of matter , in thi s case the metric 
tensor distribute d around this point can be found from  the formula:  
ⅆ𝒔𝟐=𝑪𝟐ⅆ𝒕𝟐−ⅆ𝒓𝟐−𝒓𝟐ⅆ𝜽𝟐−𝒓𝟐𝒔𝒊𝒏𝟐𝜽ⅆ𝜴𝟐       (1) 
 So for  a point P(t , r , 𝜽 , 𝛀 ) the metric  is : 
𝒈𝒕𝒕 =𝑪𝟐 ,   𝒈𝒓𝒓=−𝟏 ,𝒈𝜽𝜽=−𝒓𝟐 ,𝒈𝛀𝛀=−𝒓𝟐𝒔𝒊𝒏𝟐𝜽 , 
and all other component s equal  zero . 
Now suppose we put a mas s M in point O . This mass will cause some cha nges in the space -time  around 
the point . 
Let's temporarily forget everything we know about Newton's law, general relativity and Schwarzschild's 
solution and look for a new way to address the problem guided  only by  the ge neral principles of  physics 
and special relativit y and let us begin by making the  following simple assumption : The presence of mass 
will cause the s pace around it t o move inward in the direction to  the center, so that the sp eed of any poi nt 
of this space with respect to  the center  is given by: 
𝐯=√𝟐𝐆𝐌
𝐫   (2) 
This velocity will cause changes in the radial  distance and time measurements as required by special 
relativity:  
 
ⅆr′=√1−v2
C2ⅆr   , 
and   
ⅆt′=ⅆt
√1−v2
c2 . 
Substituting from equ ation (2) we get:  
ⅆr′=√1−𝟐𝑮𝑴
𝒄𝟐𝒓ⅆr , 
  and   
ⅆt′=ⅆt
√1−𝟐𝑮𝑴
𝒄𝟐𝒓 . 
Now by s ubstituting into Equation (1) we get:  
 ⅆ𝒔𝟐=√𝟏−𝟐𝑮𝑴
𝒄𝟐𝒓𝑪𝟐ⅆ𝒕′𝟐−ⅆ𝒓′𝟐
√𝟏−𝟐𝑮𝑴
𝒄𝟐𝒓−𝒓′𝟐ⅆ𝜽′𝟐−𝒓′𝟐𝒔𝒊𝒏𝟐𝜽′ⅆ𝜴′𝟐(3) 
 
This is the same result that Schwarzschild arrived at! 
We also notice the equivalence  between the two methods when we calculate the singularity points . 
According  to the formula (2) , there is a singularity point when the speed of points  of space reaches the 
speed of light. When  calculating the radius with which this speed is achieved,  we will find it to be the  same 
as the Schwarzschild  radius.  
 
[This formula is attributed to Schwarzschild, although the first person to arrive at this exact formulation 
was Droste, [2] but it was Schwarzschild who developed the general method that leads to this formula 
and the formula close to it that he himself arrived at, which does not differ from Droste's formula except 
in the assumption that determines the point of singularity. ] 
 
It is truly amazing that such a simple assumption can lead to the same formula deduced by Schwarzschild  
from the principles of general relativity, an d it is worth notin g that  if we consider equation (2) to be a 
modified version of Newton's law of universal gravitation, it will be an equivalent formula to general 
relativity, at least in applications to the gravitational field outside the gravitational source.  But in reality, 
although this f ormula bears apparent resemblance to newton ’s law of gravitation,  we find this formula 
radically different from it because it does not represent a force field,  but rather represents the effect of 
matter on the space around it in the form of movement off  all points of space (space flow) at  certain 
speeds to be reflected on the metric tensor and meet general relativity.  
 More importantly, the velocity, which we have used as a means by which we can calculate the effect of 
a gravitational source on the metric tensor, can be used to solve a major dilemma in general relativity, 
namely the summation of gravi tational fields, since the metric tensor produced by two gravitational 
sources is not equal to the sum of the two metric tensors produced by each source separately and we do 
not know any way to find the resultant. We do not know any way to find the resultant  metric in the case  
of two sources , but we do know how to add the velocities, so in the case of  more than one source of 
gravitation,  we can add the velocities resulting from each source at a certain point and t hen convert this 
velocity into metric  tensor and so we have a complete map o f the distribution of the  metric  tens or around 
the sources of gravitation . Not only that, but we can also calculate this for all cases of gravitational source 
motion because we know the effect of the velocity of the gravitational source on the velocity of the points 
where we want to study the gravitational field.  
Let's illustrate this with a simple example where we apply these ideas:  
Suppose we have two objects of mases M1 and M2 and let them be separated  by a distance D, and that 
M2 is at rest and M1  is moving with speed u away  from M 2, and we wa nt to calcul ate the  effect of these 
two object on the metric tensor at the midpoint between them:   
 
 
We have:  
𝐯𝟐=√𝟒𝐆(𝐌𝟐)
𝐃   and 
 
 
𝐯𝟏=√𝟒𝐆(𝐌𝟏)
𝐃  + 𝐮
𝟏+√𝟒𝐆(𝐌𝟏)
𝐃  𝐮/𝐂𝟐 
 
The resulta nt velocity  V=V2−𝑉2 in X direction , the other direction will no t be affected.  
Then if we use Cartesian  coordinates shown in the figure we get:  
𝒈𝒙𝒙 =−𝟏
√𝟏−𝒗𝟐
𝒄𝟐 ,   𝒈𝒚𝒚=−𝟏 ,𝒈𝒛𝒛=−𝟏 ,𝒈𝐭𝐭=𝑪𝟐√𝟏−𝒗𝟐
𝑪𝟐 , 
and all other components equal zero.  
 
  
 
Conclusions and Outlook  
It is clear that the idea of explaining gravitation on the basis of geometry  is a beautiful  and very attractive 
to the point of discouraging  physicists from thinking about alternatives to it, but t his does not prevent us 
from trying  to address the shortcomings and fill the gaps in this explanation by using other concepts that  
share the same results.
