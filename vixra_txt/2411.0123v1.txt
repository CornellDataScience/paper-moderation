ABSTRACT  
 
A unified mathematical framework, referred to as Picard –Fuchs Hypergeometric Manifolds (PFHM), is introduced to 
integrate modular symmetry, coupled dynamics and energy conservation. PFHM are constructed using a synthesis of 
Ramanujan’s real period functions, Picard –Fuchs differential equations and Gaussian hypergeometric functions. We argue 
that PFHM provide an effective representation of two -dimensional coupled subsystems embedded in three -dimensional 
manifolds with dihedral symmetry .  These coupled subsys tems exhibit constrained energy reciprocity, making PFHM a 
robust tool for elucidating stable, closed and homoclinic orbits in Hamiltonian systems.  An application of the proposed 
method is explored in the context of quantum entanglement .  The intrinsic energetic reciprocity and symmetry of PFHM 
are shown to be analogous to the nonlocal correlations in entangled quantum systems.  Modelling entangled pairs as 
constrained subsystems, the PFHM framework sheds new light on the energy dynamics and nonlocal corre lations 
underpin ning quantum entanglement .

INTRODUCTION  
 
Hamiltonian systems capture  the dynamics of physical phenomena through conservation laws. Yet, the behavior of 
coupled subsystems, particularly in higher -dimensional manifolds, presents significant analytical and computational 
challenges. This paper proposes a unified framework  that combines modular symmetry, coupled dynamics, and energy 
conservation.  This framework links three mathematical constructs that are known for their versatility in addressing 
complex systems : 
1. Picard –Fuchs differential equations (henceforth  PF).  PF are simple, linear, ordinary differential equations whose 
solutions describe the periods of elliptic curves (Shen 2017; Kreshchuk and Gulden, 2019 ).  Well-suited for 
defining periods of algebraic varieties, PF characterize the behavior of physical systems over parameter spaces .  
They  have the unvaluable advantage of encompassing period -energy functions, allowing energy to be used as a 
parameter.  
2. Gaussian hypergeometric functions .  In particular, the Gaussian hypergeometric special function 2F1 (a,b;c;z) is 
characterized by three regular singular points where the growth of solutions in the complex plane is bounded by 
an algebraic function (Becken and Schmelcher, 2000; Olde Daalhuis 2010).  It  allow s the construction of 
manifolds with rich symmetry properties and smooth interrelations between subsystems  (Ratner et al., 2001; 
Jong et al., 2015).   
3. Ramanujan’s real period functions .  They provide a foundation for describing modular structures  (Shen 2017) .   
 
 
Picard –Fuchs Hypergeometric Manifolds  (PFHM) can be constructed as follows : 
1. Hypergeometric manifolds .  Begin with a two -dimensional base manifold defined using Gaussian 
hypergeometric functions. The base manifold is governed by the Picard –Fuchs equation:  
, 
               where . 
 
2. Ramanujan’s period functions .  Define modular transformations on  M2, embedding it in a higher -dimensional 
space. The transformation generates symmetries corresponding to 
dihedral structures.  
 
3. Three -dimensional coupled systems .  Extend  M2 to a three -dimensional manifold M3 by coupling two 
subsystems with Hamiltonian interactions:  
2 , 
               where is the coupling potential.  
 
 
The hypergeometric version of P F is satisfied by a set of integral period functions that define geometries characterized 
by simple, closed plane curves originating at regular points  (Beukers and Heckman, 1989;  Fürnsinn and Yurkevich, 2023 ).   
PFHM  are characterized by a double -periodic elliptic function and a countable toric section of the Hamiltonian  (Klee 
2018a) .  Given the system’s Hamiltonian , the associated real period function  can be described by the 
integral -differential algorithm (Klee 2019):  
 
 
 
with the same signatures  found in the Ramanujan theory of elliptic functions related to the integral period 
functions ,  and  (Ramanujan 1914; Shen 2017 ).   
When the potential reaches its minimum, the phase curves form closed loops, which can be characterized using the period 
function   (Klee 2019) : 
. 
 
The invariant differential  can be integrated on any loop around the Riemannian 
surface  .  
This means that the total Hamiltonian H enforces energetic reciprocity:  
 
, 
 
ensuring that energy shifts in one subsystem inversely mirror shifts in the other. This reciprocity leads to constrained 
dynamics that stabilize periodic orbits.  
This fram ework is especially valuable for describing the behaviour of stable, periodic closed trajectories in multi -
dimensional phase spaces, such as homoclinic orbits connecting saddle points and periodic orbits exhibiting dihedral 
symmetry  of M3.  Additionally, t he PFHM framework also facilitates chaotic dynamics under certain parameter 
conditions, where nonlinear interactions induced by the coupling potential amplify sensitivity to initial 
conditions  (Guo et al., 2021) .  
 
In sum, PFHM is a versatile tool that enables the generation of numerous algorithms and series of identities  (Klee 2018a) .  
Slight changes in the variable period  and/or the Gaussian hypergeometric function lead to entirely different 
manifolds, which can be interpreted in the context of (physical or biological) dynamical systems exhibiting dihedral 
symmetry .  Notably, the systems’ energetic requirement s and constraints can be calculated  by plotting cross sections of 
the toric energy surface with plane curves .  In the sequel , we will assess the phase space  and the Hamiltonian of dynamical 
system s characterized by stable and closed orbits , with special emphasis on the ir energetic features.   
 
 
 
FROM HYPERGEOMETRIC PHASE SPACES TO REAL SYSTEMS   
 
We propose that PFHM could serve as a mathematical framework to elucidate the phase spaces and energetic dynamics 
of real systems .  To provide a  proof -of-concept  example, consider the phase space trajectories of three -dimensional system 
composed of the orthogonal subsystems S1 and S2 characterized by homoclinic,  stable, closed orbits , where p eriod 
integrals along the contour curves enable the evalua tion of  time dynamics (Klee 2018 b).  See Figure .  The S1’s planar 
layer contain s a family of Hamiltonian level curves indexed by energy   with the lowest energetic level located 
at the center  and the higher on the borders .  The higher the energy, the larger the closed orbit crossed by a hypothetical  
particle traveling in the S1’s phase space.  The HPFM procedure allows S1 and its family of Hamiltonian curves to be  
coupled with S2 Hamiltonian curves  that reciprocally influence each other. The single complex dynamical system formed 
by the two subsystems S1 and S2 displays peculiar features:    
1) The two-dimensional subsystems are located on perpendicular planes inside a three -dimensional phase space.   
2) The system is finite and featur es dihedral symmetry . 
3) The constrained trajectories of the subsystems follow homoclinic, stable  and closed orbits .  
3 4) The system could be treated either as continuous or quantized.    
5) Due to the extreme value theorem, a real -valued function that is continuous on the closed and bounded interval 
must attain at least a maximum and a minimum  on a compact manifold .  
6) Plotting cross sections of the toric energy surface s allows energy inversion symmetry.  Differently from other 
Hamiltonian surfaces, the real period T(α) determines the complex period T(1-α) up to a rescal ing, leading to 
energy inversion  α
1−α   (Klee 2018a).      
7) For every fixed value of the Hamiltonian, equipotential subspaces can be found in every subsystem.   Therefore, 
changes in radius and energetic levels in S1 are inversely correlated with changes in radius and energetic levels 
in S2  (Figure ).  Contrary to S1, the S2 energetic values  decrease from the center to the periphery.     
8) The (physical or biological) subsystems S1 and S2 are coupled by an inverse linear function in such a way that 
the total energy of the system is conser ved.  Energetic increases in S 1 must be balanced by inversely proportional  
energetic decreases in S 2.  This means that the dynamics result in linear, balanced, reciprocally induced energetic 
constraints between the S1 and S2 subsystems.    
 
The closed  orbits with coupled Hamiltonian dynamics could represent energetic levels of physical forces like gravitation 
or electromagnetism, energy exchanges between coupled plasma waves, coupled celestial orbits in three -body problems, 
oscillatory dynamics in coupled neurons, predator -prey systems with constrained energy exchanges, paths followed by 
social agents’ networks, etc.  In the sequel, we will focus on the special case of quantum entanglement.  
 
Figure 2 .  The dynamical three -dimensional system S1 -S2 featur es dihedral symmetry  with r eal period function T(α) = 
2F1 (1/6, 5/6; 1; α). Every one of the two  perpendicular two-dimensional planar layer s contain s a family of Hamiltonian 
level curves indexed by energy .  By adjusting the α value upward or downward, distinct and predictable time dynamics 
emerge within each subsystem  (thicker circles) . In contrast to subsystem S1 , the energetic values of S2 decrease from the 
center to the periphery, such that changes in the energy of S1  are inversely proportional to those in S2 .  Modified from

4 QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT THROUGH THE LENS OF PICARD –FUCHS HYPERGEOMETRIC 
MANIFOLDS  
 
Despite experimental validation, a comprehensive framework link ing the nonlocal correlations of quantum entanglement 
to the underlying dynamics remains elusive  (Nakata and Murao , 2020; Köhnke  et al., 2021 ).  Since PFHM are manifolds 
derived from the modular structures and symmetries inherent in hypergeometric functions, they naturally account for 
coupled dynamics and reciprocal interactions, making them a promising framework for modelling the behaviour of 
entangled particles .  PFHM  allows the description of the coordinate variables in terms of c omplex values match ing each 
plane curve to a Riemann surface  with nontrivial topology.  This observation provides the mathematical and 
logical backbone  to treat quantum entanglement i n terms of paths travel ing inside PFHM -like manifolds  (Krutyanskiy et 
al., 2023 ).   
 
PFHM for quantum systems is  constructed using three core components:  
1. Base manifold representation .  The state space of two entangled particles is modeled using a two -dimensional 
hypergeometric manifold with state amplitudes defined as solutions to the Picard –Fuchs equation:  
 
, 
where represents the quantum state amplitudes and a,  b, c parameterize the system.  
 
2. Extension to PFHM .  By embedding  M2 into a three -dimensional manifold M3, the coupled dynamics of 
entangled subsystems are described by a Hamiltonian:  
 
, 
where is the interaction potential that encapsulates entanglement.  
 
3. Symmetry and reciprocity .  Using modular transformations derived from Ramanujan’s period functions, the 
energy dynamics of the coupled system satisfy reciprocity:  
 
. 
 
 
Once PFHM has been  established for quantum systems, quantum entanglement can be modelled  using the following 
procedure :   
1.  Representing entangled states .  In the PFHM framework, an entangled quantum state  is represented as a 
point on M3.  For a two -particle system:  
, 
where and are basis states. The amplitudes α and β evolve on the manifold according to the Picard –Fuchs 
equations, with the coupling potential encoding the entanglement.  
 
2. Energetic reciprocity in entangled systems . The constrained energetic reciprocity in PFHM reflects the 
conservation laws in quantum systems:  
. 
 
In entangled states, changes in one subsystem’s energy spectrum are instantaneously mirrored in the other, preserving the 
total system’s symmetry.   Within a PFHM -like phase space, the energetic configuration of particles in one subsystem can 
be predicted by examining the energetic configuration of particles in the coupled subsystem .   
 
 
5 3. Quantum measurement as a geometric projection .  Quantum measurement is modeled as a projection of the state 
vector onto a specific submanifold of M3.  The outcome of a measurement collapses the manifold’s global 
symmetry into localized states, consistent with observed quantum correlations.   
 
 
In sum, by embedding quantum systems in a higher -dimensional manifold, the dihedral symmetry of PFHM captures the 
nonlocal nature of entanglement.  The simultaneous correlation of entangled particles becomes clear when viewed as 
embedded within hypergeometric coupled phase spaces, where their trajectories are governed by constraints imposed by 
conservation laws inherent in the Hamiltonian .   
 
 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
We introduce a new mathematical approach for modeling Hamiltonian dynamics in complex coupled systems while 
leaving room for empirical validation and interdisciplinary exploration.   The concept of energetic reciprocity in coupled 
Hamiltonian subsystems  with dihedral symmetry  aligns with the conservation principles and the coupled behaviors 
observed in biological and physical systems , offer ing new insights into periodic and chaotic behaviors .  For example, in 
cryptography and image processing, a message or visual image encoded within the invariant orbits of PHFM subsystems 
can be mapped onto the orbits of another subsystem, creating a hypergeometric projection of the original data. Similar to 
mapping a world chart, homoclinic or heteroclinic projections between two coupled hypergeometric manifolds c an be 
performed, offering additional applications in digital imaging and memory storage.  
 
This paper specifically explores PFHM as a structured framework for modelling quantum entanglement .  Taking into 
account the constrained inverse reciprocity of trajectories within coupled subsystems , the modular structures, the energetic 
reciprocity and the higher -dimensional symmetries, PFHM offers a novel approach to understanding the dynamics  and 
nonlocality of entangled systems.  The framework is very flexible and can be adapted to multi -particle entanglement and 
extended to infinite -dimensional systems.  The extension of PFHM to field -theoretic systems suggests applications in 
describing entangled fields, particularly in curved spacetime or sce narios involving the AdS/CFT correspondence  
 
Our study has its limitations. While the concept offers several strengths, it ventures  into complex theoretical terrain that 
demands rigorous validation and enhanced conceptual clarity. In particular, the mapping of quantum observables onto 
PFHM needs further refinement, especially for systems with high degrees of freedom. Developing experimental designs 
to test the predict ions of the PFHM framework is an essential next step.  
   
Future research should aim to extend PFHM to non -Hamiltonian systems and investigate computational techniques for 
solving PFHM -derived equations in high -dimensional spaces. Additionally, future work will focus on expanding this 
structured framework to inco rporate quantum computing, specifically to model qubits in entangled states  (Graham  et al., 
2022) . Indeed, t he geometric properties of PFHM can be used to optimize quantum gate operations by maintaining the 
reciprocity and symmetry crucial for preserving e ntanglement.  
 
In summary, the connection between dynamical systems (e.g., homoclinic paths), Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum 
entanglement represents a significant leap from abstract mathematical structures to dynamic systems. This suggests a 
unifying framework that co uld provide  a versatile approach to understanding complex interactions across disciplines.
