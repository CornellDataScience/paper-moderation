We demonstrate theoretically that a subwavelength spherical dielectric nanoparticle coated with a gain shell forms a 
nanolaser. Lasing modes of such a nanolaser are associated with the Mie resonances of the nanoparticle. We 
establish a general condition for the lasing threshold and show that the use of high refractive index dielectric media 
allows for lasing with a threshold significantly lower than that for nanolasers incorporating lossy plasmonic metals. 

 

A nanolaser is a novel type of quantum device that enables the generation of a coherent 
electromagnetic field at the subwavelength scale.1-4 In order to localize the electromagnetic field 
of a laser mode at the nanoscale, one employs surface plasmons instead of photons because the 
wavelength of a plasmon is shorter than that of a photon at the same frequency. The nanolaser 
can  be  several  wavelengths  in  length5  producing  a  beam  of  light  like  a  usual  laser  or  be  of 
subwavelength  size  radiating  like  a  multipole.  In  the  latter  case,  it  is  referred  to  as  a  spaser.1 
Basically, a spaser consists of a plasmonic nanoparticle (NP) coupled to a gain medium pumped 
by  an  external  energy  source.  A  serious  problem  that  hinders  the  experimental  realization  of 
spasers is that the extreme loss in plasmonic metals raises the lasing threshold of spasers.6, 7 In 
addition, the effects of nonlocality and spatial dispersion generally increase the lasing threshold.8 
Attempts  have  been  made  to  lower  the  high  gain  required  for  generation  in  plasmonic-based 
nanolasers using a special design for core-shell cavities.9, 10 However, the resulting threshold is 
still high. In particular, use of the optimal core-shell design9 allows one to lower threshold gain

Semiconductor media exhibiting high refractive indices in the optical range, such as Si, 
Ge, and GaAs, allow for a realization of subwavelength spherical resonators without the use of 
lossy  metals.  Note  that  in  the  near  infrared  region  these  materials  should  be  considered  as 
dielectrics  rather  than  semiconductors,  which  they  are  in  the  optical  region.  It  was  predicted 
theoretically that spherical silicon NPs exhibit a strong low-loss magnetic response in the optical

frequency  range.11  Thanks  to  the  progress  in  the  fabrication  of  silicon  nano-sized  spherical 
particles,12, 13 the predicted strong magnetic response of dielectric particles associated with Mie 
resonances has become experimentally accessible. Very recently, it has been proposed that the 
use of a gain medium can further enhance the magnetic response of silicon particles.14 Such a 
high-quality  resonator  may  serve  as  a  platform  for  the  design  of  a  quantum  generator  of  a 
coherent  near-field.  As  with  a  spaser,  in  which  a  plasmon  mode  localized  on  a  metallic  NP 
couples  to  the  gain  medium,  in  the  case  of  a  high-permittivity  spherical  dielectric  particle 
surrounded by an active material, the near-field of a certain Mie resonance should couple to the 
gain medium. 

Scattering of light from spherical particles with gain, or “negative absorption”, has been 
studied long ago in a number of works.15, 16 Although peculiarities in the scattering spectrum by a 
particle were found, their connection to the lasing modes of an amplifying particle has not been 
discussed.  In  those  works,  the  response  of  the  amplifying  nanoparticle  has  been  studied  for  a 
discreet set of gain values, while a scattering singularity, which gives rise to the laser generation, 
occurs at one point in the gain parameter space. Later, the connection between these singularities 
and lasing has been established.17 After that, lasing in dielectric cavities through Mie resonances 
has been extensively studied.18-20 Mie resonances giving rise to lasing considered in those studies 
are  the  well-known  whispering  gallery  mode  (WGM)  resonances.  Resonances  supported  by 
subwavelength semiconductor NPs should be distinguished from the WGM resonances, which 
occur in particles with sizes larger than the  free space wavelength.21 Unlike WGM lasers, the 
semiconductor NP based nanolaser theoretically described in our work operates at low order Mie 
resonances which occur at free space wavelength larger than the NP dimension. This is the main 
feature of our work. 

In  this  paper,  we  investigate  self-oscillations  of  a  core-shell  dielectric  nanostructure 
containing an active medium with inverse population. We show that a lasing transition can be 
observed beyond a certain (threshold) level of gain appearing as a singularity of the scattering 
cross  section.  We  find  the  set  of  lasing  modes  of  the  dielectric  nanolaser  and,  using  actual 
material  parameters  for  high  refractive-index  media,  compare  the  threshold  characteristics  of 
dielectric-based nanolasers with those of metallic-based spasers. 

Although the laser generation is essentially a nonlinear process, the threshold pumping 
for lasing can be found within a linear approximation.22, 23 The transition to lasing emerges as a 
non-trivial solution of Maxwell’s equations in the absence of an incident field. The amplitude of 
this self-oscillation is determined by an excess of the pump rate over the pumping threshold. At 
the  threshold,  the  amplitude  of  the  laser  self-oscillation  is  equal  to  zero.  Therefore,  for  pump 
te ω -time 
powers below and at the threshold, the problem can be treated linearly. Assuming the  
i
dependence  of  the  electromagnetic  fields  we  describe  the  gain  medium  by  the  Lorentzian 
permittivity with the negative imaginary part due to population inversion created by an external 
pump:24, 25

In order to find the electromagnetic self-oscillation of a core-shell spherical particle, we 
look for a non-zero solution of Maxwell’s equations in absence of an incident field. Following 
the  standard  approach,  we  decompose  electric  and  magnetic  fields  in  the  dielectric  core  in  a

The  field  in  the  external  region  contains  only  terms  corresponding  to  the  outgoing 
solution, which implies an absence of incident radiation. This field is non-zero if at least one of 
na  or 
nb  coefficients is non-zero for some  n . By imposing boundary conditions at the interfaces 
between high-permittivity and gain media, and between the gain medium and the vacuum, we 
arrive at a system of linear equations, allowing us to determine unknown coefficients in series

Nonlinear  complex-valued  Eq.  (6)  determines  the  lasing  threshold, 

thD ,  as  well  as  the 
frequency  of  the  self-oscillation.  Note  that  at  fixed  pumping,  below  the  threshold,  Eq.  (6) 
nB .27 In a problem with an incident 
represents the condition for the poles of the Mie coefficients 
field, these coefficients determine the electromagnetic field scattered by the NP. Similarly, the 
condition for the existence of the electric lasing mode coincides with the condition for the pole of 
nA  coefficients. Therefore, the lasing modes of a core-shell spherical NP are associated with the 
poles  of  the  corresponding  Mie  coefficients.  Below  the  threshold,  the  scattering  singularities 
have complex-valued frequencies. Specifically, these singularities are located in the frequency 
lower half-plane; i.e., their frequencies have a negative imaginary part,  Im
0ω< , indicating the 
exponential in time decay of the corresponding quasistationary state.28 With a gain increase in 
the system, the poles may reach the real frequency axis on the complex plane, giving rise to a 
lasing mode.23, 25 

Let us show that, for a certain value of gain, the pole of the magnetic coefficient, 

1B , 
appears at a real-valued frequency. To demonstrate the existence of a self-oscillating solution we 
tune the emission frequency of the gain medium to the dipole magnetic resonance of the core-
shell  nanolaser,  occurring  at  approximately 
.  Figure  2  shows  the  logarithm  of  the 
1B , as a function of the wavelength and the gain 
squared absolute value of the Mie coefficient,

increased by orders of magnitude (the peak denoted by a black color in Fig. 2). This feature of 
the graph is a clear indication that a pole of the Mie coefficient has been reached and, therefore, 
that laser generation should begin. Importantly, the resulting lasing wavelength is not necessarily 
equal to the gain medium emission wavelength if it was initially tuned to the wavelength of the 
Mie resonance. This occurs due to an increase of the refractive index of the gain shell induced by 
the increase in gain that leads to the shift of the “cold” resonance wavelength. With a further 
1B  decreases. This behavior, however, does not imply that the lasing has been 
increase in gain, 
turned off, because when the threshold is reached, the laser becomes a strongly nonlinear system, 
and saturation of the gain medium must be taken into account to correctly describe the behavior 
of the laser above the threshold.  In fact, when the gain exceeds the threshold, the pole of the 
corresponding  Mie  coefficient  moves  to  the  upper  half  of  the  complex  frequency  plane, 
0ω> .23 It corresponds to  a solution with a time dependence proportional to  the diverging 
Im
exp Im tω . This exponential growth is suppressed by the saturation of the 
exponential factor, 
gain medium when lasing reaches the steady-state regime.

We  stress  that  the  lasing  modes  of  the  dielectric  nanolaser  considered  in  this  paper 
substantially differ from those of WGM lasers. Although WGM lasers have an ultra-low lasing 
threshold,  their  sizes  are  typically  of  the  order  of  microns  or  a  dozen  microns.21  Indeed,  the 
WGM resonance is a Mie resonance of a dielectric particle that occurs at large n. To fulfill the 
resonance condition for a high-order Mie coefficient, either the wavelength must be small or the 
particle size must be large.

We now compare the lasing thresholds of the dielectric nanolaser with that of an Au-

than  those  of  the  spaser.  This  is  especially  noticeable  for  the  low-loss  magnetic  quadrupole

Silicon is not the only material that can be used in the design of subwavelength non-
metallic  nanolasers.  In  particular,  spherical  NPs  made  of  other  materials  with  high  refractive 
indexes, such as Ge and GaAs, can be fabricated.29 From our point of view, however, silicon 
seems to be the most favorable candidate for the realization of dielectric nanolasers. Due to its 
electronic  bandgap  of 
  and  a 
 in the region in which quadrupole resonances of the 
relatively high refractive index of  ~ 3.5
core-shell  particle  appear  (wavelengths  600 700nm

optical  frequencies  that  could  allow  for  lasing  modes  at  smaller  particle  sizes;  however,  its 
absorption is higher by an order of magnitude.26 Ge also exhibits high absorption at wavelengths

To conclude, we have shown that a subwavelength spherical dielectric NP coupled to a 
gain medium forms a nanolaser whose lasing modes are associated with the Mie resonances of a 
NP.  We  establish  the  general  condition  for  the  lasing  threshold,  from  which  one  can  obtain 
numerically  the  level  of  threshold  gain.  The  thresholds  for  the  electric  and  magnetic  dipole 
modes  of  the  dielectric  nanolaser  are  comparable  to  the  thresholds  for  the  dipole  mode  of  a 
spaser with a 7-nm Au core. The thresholds of the quadrupole modes arising in the optical range 
are significantly lower than the characteristic spaser threshold.
