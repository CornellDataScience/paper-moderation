Abstract—Spatially indirect electron-hole exciton condensates stabilized by interlayer Fock exchange interactions have 
been predicted in systems containing a pair of two-dimensional semiconductor or semimetal layers separated by a thin 
tunnel dielectric.  The layer degree of freedom in these systems can be described as a pseudospin. Condensation is then 
analogous  to  ferromagnetism,  and  the  interplay  between  collective  and  quasiparticle  contributions  to  transport  is 
analogous  to  phenomena  that  are  heavily  studied  in  spintronics.  These  phenomena  are  the  basis  for pseudospintronic 
device proposals based on possible low-voltage switching between high (nearly shorted) and low interlayer conductance 
states  and  on  near  perfect  Coulomb  drag-counterflow  current  along  the  layers.  In  this  work,  a  quantum  transport 
simulator  incorporating  a  non-local  Fock  exchange  interaction  is  presented,  and  used  to  model  the  essential transport 
physics in the bilayer graphene system. Finite size effects, Coulomb drag-counterflow current, critical interlayer currents 
beyond  which  interlayer  DC  conductance  collapses  at  sub-thermal  voltages,  non-local  coupling  between  interlayer 
critical currents in multiple lead devices, and an Andreev-like reflection process are illustrated.  

 
I. INTRODUCTION 

Coherent pairing of electrons and holes localized in separate III-V semiconductor layers has been observed at high 

magnetic fields and cryogenic temperatures in systems containing a pair of quantum wells separated by tunnel barriers 

(where holes are defined within as empty states in partially empty Landau levels).1-4 In these spatially indirect exciton 

condensates,  interlayer  coherence  is  mediated  by  the  interlayer  Fock  exchange  interactions.3  The  consequences  of 

condensate formation that have been studied experimentally include novel transport effects such as near perfect Coulomb 

drag-counterflow currents, and greatly enhanced interlayer conductance up to a critical current Ic and a corresponding 

critical  interlayer  voltage  Vc  beyond  which  the  DC  current  collapses,5  the  latter  effect  being  partially  analogous  to 

transport phenomena in Josephson junctions. In this paper, we present a theoretical quantum transport simulation study of 

closely related phenomena in the absence of a magnetic field. Although spatially indirect exciton condensation has not 

yet been observed in this regime, it is expected to appear when nesting is established between electron- and hole-like 

Fermi surfaces of two-dimensional semiconductors, gapless semiconductors, or semimetals. The prospects for observing 

spatially  indirect  exciton  condensation  are  therefore  being  enhanced  by  progress  in  fabricating  and  studying  two-

dimensional  materials.  In  this  study  we  choose  for  the  sake  of  definiteness  to  study  graphene  bilayers,  but  our 

conclusions apply equally well to other systems. 

First successfully isolated about a decade ago, graphene already has exhibited a broad set of novel phenomena of 

interest  to  researchers  from  multiple  disciplines,  such  as  the  half-integer  quantum  Hall  effect  and  the  related  Berry’s 

phase that had been predicted theoretically by physicists.6,7 Its unique symmetric and conical band structure has allowed 

research  on  the  properties  of  massless  Dirac  Fermions,  including  novel  transport  properties  in  semiconductor  device 

physics. When separated by dielectric tunnel barriers such has hexagonal boron nitride, it is possible to take advantage of 

the symmetry between graphene’s electron and hole band structures to establish the Fermi surface nesting conditions that 

favor interlayer exciton condensates.8,9 Systems based on monolayer or few-layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) 

semiconductors  have  extremely  large  exciton  binding  energies  and  may  provide  an  even  better  platform  for  such 

condensates. The prospect of transport effects analogous to those in already studied in III-V quantum well systems, but 

absent magnetic fields and at higher temperatures9,10 perhaps even room temperature, have led to novel “beyond CMOS” 

device proposals with switching energies potentially of only a few tens of zepto-joules, including the Bilayer pseudoSpin 

Field-Effect Transistor (BiSFET)11-14 and, more recently, the Bilayer pseudoSpin Junction Transistor (BiSJT).15 

Studies of the transport properties of systems containing a spatially indirect exciton condensate require simulators 

that incorporate the non-local Fock exchange interaction. We describe such a simulator in detail, and use it to model 

essential  transport  physics  including  finite  size  effects,  critical  currents  at  sub-thermal  voltages,  Coulomb  drag-

counterflow current, non-local coupling between critical currents in multi-terminal devices, and a reflection process for 

this  system  akin  to  the  Andreev  reflection  at  the  boundary  of  a  conventional  superfluid.  Although  the  simulation 

techniques described here should be transferable to TMD based system, or to other two-dimensional semiconductors or 

semimetals, simulations might in some cases have significantly greater computational costs, depending on the complexity 

of  the  electronic  structure.  The  purpose  of  this  work  is  to  model  essential  transport  properties in  the  presence of  the 

exciton condensates, including but not limited to those serving as the basis for BiSFET and BiSJT. The challenges which 

must be met to achieve such condensates have been and are being addressed elsewhere.8-10,16 This work is intended to 

motivate such work, and to help with the interpretation and design of experiments as well as potential devices. 

 Portions of this work were reported previously in conference publications.13,17,18 Here, more details of the method, 

more complete sets of data, a more comprehensive and synergistic analysis thereof, and a more thorough discussion of 

the underlying essential physics including interpretations in terms of electrons, holes, and excitons are provided. 

The  quantum  transport  simulator  and  the  system  model  used  here  are  discussed  in  Section  II;  various  transport 

properties and discussions of underlying essential physics are addressed in Section III. 

II. TIGHT-BINDING HARTREE-FOCK MODEL 

Although  we  discuss  electron-hole  interactions,  transport  simulations  are  performed  entirely  in  terms  of  electron 

states within the conduction and valence bands of opposite layers. The Hartree-Fock approximation is used to model the 

exchange  interaction  between  electrons  (due  to  their  indistinguishability  and  odd  parity)  within  a  single-particle 

framework.  The  resulting  time-independent  Schrödinger’s  equation  for  single-electron  energy  eigenstates  {φβ(r),  Eβ}, 

neglecting for the moment the external potential profile, takes the form:

The second term on the left of Eq. (1a) is the local Hartree potential term describing the classical electrostatic potential at 

r  due to a charge distribution  −qρ(r) = −qρ(r,r), to which we can readily add the contributions of externally applied 

electrostatic fields. The third term is the non-local and purely quantum mechanical Fock exchange interaction, which 

lowers the electron-electron interaction energy due to tendency of the odd-parity electrons to be further away from each 

other than expected classically.19 The indices β (βꞌ) label the single electron states and the fβ (fβꞌ) are their occupation 

probabilities.  VC(r,rꞌ)  is  the  Coulomb  interaction  energy  between  electrons  at  positions  r  and  rꞌ.  (Notably,  the 

contributions to the Hartree and Fock terms for β = βꞌ cancel, demonstrating that Eq. (1) avoids interaction between any 

electron and itself.) 

For transport simulations, we switch to an atomistic tight-binding approximation considering in this work just one 

2pz  (π)  orbital  per  carbon  atom  site  located  at  discrete  positions  R.  (More  general  models  are  also  described  by  the 

equations that follow if the indices R  are considered to also represent the various orbitals on each atom.) Within this 

tight-binding framework, Eq. (1) can be written in the following form20:

for the top (T) layer. The form for the bottom (B) layer is obtained by switching the “T” and “B” indices. We have 

explicitly  considered  only  the  interlayer  Fock  exchange  interaction,  labeled  VF,  which  is  the  basis  for  exciton 

condensation. VH is the nominal Hartree potential energy, which in principle incorporates contributions due to charges on 

either layer, any external charge (externally applied fields), and, here, any uniform correction to the energy due to intra-

layer  Fock  exchange  interactions.  HTB  includes  the  intra-layer  and  (much  weaker)  interlayer  “bare”  tight-binding 

hopping energies. Note that VF(RT,RB) can become complex under non-equilibrium conditions through the density matrix 

ρ(RT,RB).

interaction,  VF(RT,RB),  is  considered  self-consistently.  For  this  transport  system,  the  single-electron  state  label  β  = 

{γ,σ,kx,i,ky,s} identifies the lead of injection γ, the energy “valley” σ, the incident crystal momentum ћkx,i of the injected 

wave,  the  transverse  mode  of  well-defined  crystal  momentum  ћky,  and  (real)  spin  s.  The  occupation  probability  fβ  is 

determined by its energy and the voltage applied to the lead in which it originates, Vγ = −μγ/q, where μγ is the chemical 

potential (Fermi level) of the lead γ. 

As  shown  by  the  stripes  in  the  top  and  bottom  layer  oriented  parallel  to  the  transport  direction  in  Fig.  1,  the 

simulated structure is periodic in the transverse (y) direction with a lattice constant of ay encompassing a single armchair 

pattern of carbon atoms with atomic locations within each layer ΓT(B), a subset of RT(B). (Note while we assumed A-A 

coupling here, in general there would be no requirement that the atoms on the top and bottom layers be vertically aligned 

for this purpose.) Therefore, the Fock exchange interaction term can be rewritten for, e.g., any ΓT as

Here, m(n) label individual atomic slices along the transport direction, i.e., pairs of atoms, one in the top layer and one in 

the bottom, along the shaded armchair atomic chains in the transport direction in Fig. 1. The φm(n) are the corresponding 

tight-binding  2×1  matrices/column  vectors  for  each  slice  m(n)  with  components  φT,m(n)  and  φB,m(n).  (Here  we  have 

assumed that there is nothing to induce coupling between orthogonal spin states in this graphene-based system, so that 

we  may  treat  each  spin  state  separately,  unlike  what  would  be  the  case  for  TMDs.)  The  Hm,n  are  2×2  tight-binding 

potential matrices coupling slices m and n via both the bare and Fock interactions of Eq. (5). Note that there are only non-

zero  onsite  and  nearest-neighbor  intra-layer  and  interlayer  bare  coupling  interactions,  while  the  interlayer  Fock 

interactions extend among all sites within the channel but do not, in this model, couple to points beyond the channel. 

The boundary conditions at the ends of the channel are obtained by assuming that the four leads, TL, BL, TR and BR, 

are semi-infinite and perfectly absorbing. Labeling the atomic sites within the channel from m = 1 to N, the incident (i), if 

any,  and  “outgoing”  (o)  (including  outwardly  evanescing  or  reflected  into  the  lead  of  incidence)  components  of  the 

wavefunctions  are  related  across  the  simulation  region  boundaries—between  slices  0  and  1  on  the  left  boundary  for 

example—by

Here, P0,1;i and P1,0;o are 2×2 diagonal matrices that relate the complex amplitudes of the incident (i) and outgoing (o) 

wave-function components between adjacent slices. The P0,1;i and P1,0;o are defined consistent with the required Bloch 

function form of the propagating modes in the leads, or the counterparts of Bloch functions with complex wave-vectors 

for “outgoing” evanescent modes into the leads. For example, for incident (outgoing) propagating wave-functions φγ″,m,i(o) 

in a given lead γ″ (with m ≤ 1 or m ≥ N for the left and right leads, respectively), φγ″,m,i(o) = eikγ″,i(o)·Γγ″,m ukγ″,i(o)(Γγ″,m), where 

ukγ″,i(o)(Γγ″,m) has the periodicity of the unit cell (four slices in the transport direction). The kγ″,i(o) are readily determined 

based  on  the  energy  E,  potential  energy  in  the  given  lead  γ″,  transverse  wave-vector  ky  and  required  direction  of 

propagation. Applying Eq. (7) to the Schrodinger’s equation, Eq. (6a), yields for the left boundary (slices 0 and 1),

The injected wave-functions, 0;i and N+1;i, are chosen to be localized to either the left end or the right end of the channel 

and to the top or bottom layer consistent with the definition of the index γ, and are normalized to carry the appropriate 

amount of incident current per transverse mode ky per unit energy consistent with Landauer-Büttiker theory.22 Starting 

with an initial guess of the modified Hartree-Fock potentials VF,ky(ΓT,ΓB), if just uniformly zero, we solve Eqs. (6a-c) for 

each  value  of  ky  independently.  The  Fock  exchange  interaction  for  each  value  of  ky  then  must  be  recalculated  as  a 

function  of  all  values  of  ky.  We  repeat  this  process  iteratively  to  obtain  a  self-consistent  solution  (analogous  to  self-

consistent Schrödinger-Poisson’s calculations, except with non-local potential or off-diagonal density matrix elements 

for the exchange interactions). 

For reference, Eqs. (6a-c) are equivalent to the NEGF problem GS, where the Green’s function is G = (EI – H – 

−  with  self-energy  matrix    and  source  vector  S.22  Therefore,  GS  can  be  rewritten  as  (EI  –  H  –  S. 

Comparing this latter form to Eqs. (6a-c) allows us to identify H1,0P1,0;o, HN,N+1PN,(N+1);o, and all other m,n = 

0. Similarly, S1 = H1,0(I – P1,0;oP0,1;i)0;i, SN = HN,N+1(I – PN,N+1;oPN+1,N;i) N+1;i, and all other Sl = 0. However, in these 

ballistic transport equations, we have no need for the full G matrix, which includes terms representing transport between 

internal points. 

In  the  tight-binding  model,  the  charge  current  flow  from  a  top  layer  atomic  site  RT  to  a  bottom  layer  site  RB 

associated with any particular state β, Iβ(RT,RB), is

Upon inspection, it can be seen that for the total current, but only for the total current, the component associated with the 

Fock exchange interaction includes the imaginary part of the product of the interlayer density matrix (Eqs. (2b-c)) with 

its Hermitian adjoint, which intrinsically vanishes. The expression for the total interlayer site-to-site current I(RT,RB) 

thus takes the simplified form,

a result that is independent of condensate formation.14,23 Therefore, bare coupling between sites is required for a nonzero 

net current flow between those sites, and, therefore, a so-called “spontaneous” condensate formed in the absence of any 

bare interlayer coupling—with a large interlayer density matrix ρ(RT,RB) self-consistently obtained via Fock interlayer 

exchange interaction that is proportional to ρ(RT,RB)—is incapable of carrying a net interlayer current. However, the

transmission probabilities are orders of magnitude lower (Fig. 4) without the condensate. (The BiSFET nominally has 

contacts to only one end, while here a negligible current flows to the grounded contacts for the “BiSFET-like” biasing, as 

seen in Fig. 5(a), so that the systems are the same in terms of this aspect of current flow.) However, this high, at least, DC 

conductance  can  only  be  maintained  up  to  a  critical  current  Ic,  again  as  determined  by  self-consistent  effects  of  the 

current flow on the entire interlayer density matrix ρ(RT,RB). The interlayer density matrix ρ(RT,RB) may be defined as a 

collective “pseudospin” ρ(RT,RB) with pseudospin magnitude ρ(RT,RB) and phase θ(RT,RB) ≡ arg[ρ(RT,RB)], which is 

analogous to a collective real spin state—magnetic moment—with strength and orientation. (This terminology underlies 

the BiSFET and BiSJT names.) As illustrated by Fig. 8, under BiSFET-like biasing, the pseudospin magnitude exhibits a 

position dependence consistent with the localization of the condensate, but is essentially independent of the interlayer 

bias, while the pseudospin phase is weakly dependent of position but varies with Vil, θ(RB,RT) ≈ θ.13 With θ evaluated at 

mid-channel for specificity, sin(θ) is proportional to Vil as shown in Fig. 9. The inter-atom current flow between layers of 

Eq. (10) can be written as

although, as previously noted, in this work we only include bare coupling, and thus total inter-atomic-site current flow, 

between top- and bottom-layer A atoms in the same unit cell. With sin(θ) having a maximum magnitude of unity when θ 

= π/2, the maximum or “critical” current magnitude is reached, as indicated by the “max” and “c” subscripts in Eqs. (11) 

and (12). In practice, as θ approaches π/2 in our simulations, the rate of convergence slows asymptotically.17 Therefore, 

we  use  the  observed linear dependence of  sin(θ) on Vil  to extract the critical currents Ic and corresponding values of 

associated “critical voltage” Vc from somewhat smaller interlayer currents and voltages.13 (Such linearity is observed also 

at θ close to π/2 in Ref. 17.) Thus-extracted Vc are shown in Fig. 10 as a function of the bare interlayer coupling, and for 

L = 15 and 20 nm. 

It was not possible to converge any solution in our steady-state calculations beyond the critical voltage. Instead, the 

solutions  are  not  numerically  stable  in  a  conventional  sense.  Instead,  the  pseudospin  magnitude  remains  essentially 

constant  with  iteration  while  the phase  smoothly  rotates  through  all  angles  periodically,  the  larger Vil  beyond  Vc,  the 

faster the rotation with iteration.14,17 The nearly constant pseudospin magnitude suggests that the condensate does not

course,  the  Landauer-Büttiker  limit  for  Gil  also  increases  with  carrier  concentration.  By  comparison,  it  is  likely  that 

resulting smoother potential change and weaker condensate in the cases for Figs. 12 and 13 partially compensate each 

other producing smaller if any changes in the saturated normalized Gil. In addition, the stronger condensate leads to a 

larger critical current per channel length (Fig. 15(b)) or even effective channel length. 

IV. CONCLUSION 

We have developed an atomistic tight-binding NEGF quantum transport method (except that we need not solve for 

the full Green’s function matrix in these ballistic simulation) for modeling non-equilibrium transport through nanoscale 

exciton condensates realized via the non-local many-body Fock exchange interaction. Specifically, we have modeled the 

graphene-dielectric-graphene  system  here.  However,  the  essential  physics  should  be  similar  in  TMD-based  material 

systems also under consideration or other material systems. In addition, the method itself should also be extendable to 

these  latter  systems,  although  with  a  greater  computational  burden.  We  have  exhibited  the  possibility  for  condensate 

formation  within  nanoscale  regions,  and  its  dependence  on  the  critical  temperature  of  the  bulk  condensate.  We  have 

exhibited essentially transport effects that serve as the basis for beyond-CMOS device proposals including: interlayer 

conductances approaching the Landauer-Büttiker  limits imposed by the  leads but limited by critical currents  (beyond 

which collapse of DC conductance and onset of THz AC conductance are expected, which is at least consistent with the 

oscillation in the pseudospin phase with  iteration seen  here),  with  the latter  reached at sub-kBT/q  voltages (BiSFET); 

critical current conservation for currents injected into two—or likely more—regions of the condensate (BiSJT); and near-

perfect  Coulomb  drag-counterflow  current  between  layers.  We  also  have  exhibited  the  underlying  transport  physics 

including  the  process  by  which  incident  (outgoing)  electron-hole  pairs  in  opposite  layers  excite  (absorb)  coherent 

excitons, in a manner somewhat analogous to Andreev reflection at the edge of conventional superfluids. The work is not 

intended to address the likelihood of achieving such condensates, which requires much greater attention to the details of 

screening and ultimately must be resolved experimentally. It is intended to motivate such work through exhibiting the 

novel  transports  effect  that  could  thus  be  achieved,  and  perhaps  to  help  with  the  interpretation  of  such  experimental 

results.
