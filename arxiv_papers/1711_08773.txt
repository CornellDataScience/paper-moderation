We consider classical two-dimensional Kepler system with spin-orbit coupling and show that at
a sufficiently strong coupling it demonstrates a chaotic behavior. The chaos emerges since the
spin-orbit coupling reduces the number of the integrals of motion as compared to the number of
the degrees of freedom. This reduction is manifested in the equations of motion as the emergence
of the anomalous velocity determined by the spin orientation. By using analytical and numerical
arguments, we demonstrate that the chaotic behavior, being driven by this anomalous term, is
related to the system energy dependence on the initial spin orientation. We observe the critical
dependence of the dynamics on the initial conditions, where system can enter and exit a stability
domain by very small changes in the initial spin orientation. Thus, this system can demonstrate a
reentrant order-from-disorder transition driven by very small variations in the initial conditions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The emergence of a chaotic behavior is one of the
most intriguing features of dynamical systems [1 -- 5].
For instance, simple dynamical systems with an energy-
dependent separatrix (boundary between qualitatively
different trajectories in their phase space), demonstrate
chaos, e.g., being driven by a periodic external field.

Dynamical systems with spin-orbit coupling (SOC),
ranging from semiconductors [6] to ultracold atomic mat-
ter [7, 8], became a topic of a great interest due to rich
variety of physical effects observable there. Here we pro-
pose and study a class of nonstandard classical conser-
vative dynamical systems, which can be characterized as
two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit coupled Kepler systems.
We show that inclusion of a new internal degree of free-
dom, namely, the particle spin, coupled to its momentum,
leads to the chaos emergence.

Without SOC, the properties of the above systems are
well-known in classical [9] and quantum [10] realization
and no chaotic behavior is expected there except a quan-
tum chaos in an applied magnetic field acting at the or-
bital electron motion [11]. Three integrals of motion:
the energy, the angular momentum, and the Runge-Lenz
vector fully determine the dynamics of the system and as-
sure its stability against chaos. The SOC introduces new
degrees of freedom and lowers the system symmetry to
the existence of only two integrals of motion. This sym-
metry reduction can be seen as a SOC-generated spin-
dependent contribution to the velocity proportional to
the SOC constant. As a result, the system loses integra-
bility due to the spin back action on the orbital motion
and can demonstrate a chaotic behavior close to the sep-
aratrix which determines the boundary between a finite
and a delocalized motion.

An experimentally realizable example of such a system
is given by 2D excitons in semiconductor structures [12 -- 
14]. We shall consider the classical limit of orbital motion
corresponding to the highly excited Rydberg states of
these excitons. Recently, it has been experimentally es-

tablished that lowering of the system symmetry from the
vacuum SO(4) to the discreet symmetry of a host crys-
tal for three-dimensional excitons leads to a chaos even
in the SOC absence [15 -- 17]. Using only classical argu-
ments, here we prove that the spin-orbit coupling, being
a lower-symmetry contribution to the system dynamics,
can induce the chaotic motion.

Two aspects of SOC-related randomness have recently
been studied in two-dimensional harmonic potentials,
where particle's motion is always finite. Larson et al.
[18] studied thermalization in cold atomic gases in the
presence of anisotropic SOC, while Marchukov et al. [19]
examined the spectral properties in terms of the ensem-
bles emerging in the random matrix theory.
In addi-
tion, a chaos-like behavior in driven SOC systems with
[20]
a strong confinement has been considered in Refs.
and [21]. Conservative two-dimensional systems with in-
teraction potentials vanishing at large distances, being
augmented by the SOC, provide nontrivial examples of
a classical chaotic behavior, qualitatively different from
above settings. Motivated by possible transitions to the
nontrivial chaotic behavior, here we study the effects of
weak and strong SOC on the dynamics of a Kepler-like
system, prove that such transitions indeed occur, and
analyze different regimes of the chaotic motion.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section II we
introduce general equations and integrals of motion for
the Kepler system with spin-orbit coupling. In Section
III we perform perturbative analysis of the trajectories
at a weak SOC. In Section IV the chaotic behavior at a
sufficiently strong SOC will be presented and analyzed.
Conclusions and relation to possible experiments will be
given in Section V.

II. EQUATIONS AND INTEGRALS OF

MOTION

We take the minimal Hamiltonian describing the 2D
Kepler problem with SOC in the form H = H0 + Hso.

and the corresponding length lso = 2/mα, necessary for
electron to essentially rotate the spin.

2

To formulate the classical equations of motion, we ob-
serve from Eq.
(2) that the above anomalous velocity
is the derivative vso = ∂Hso/∂p. For Hamiltonian func-
tion H = H0 + Hso these equations can be obtained by
substituting the spin components in Eq. (2) by their ex-
pectation values ¯σi such that ¯σ2
z = 1. This
yields

where z = (0, 0, 1) is the unit vector perpendicular to

dent on the particle momentum read:

lutions will be used for the description of the trajectories.
system are the en-
ergy E, the z−component of total angular momentum
 (L + ¯σz/2) ≡ pyx − pxy + ¯σz/2 and the length of the
spin vector ¯σ2 = 1. The above conservation laws can be
verified by direct calculation. The conservation of spin
vector length is due to the spin precession with the tip
moving over the Bloch sphere. Note that there is no in-
tegral of motion corresponding to the Runge-Lenz vector
specific for the Coulomb-like field in the Kepler prob-
lem without spin-orbit coupling. Then, with the SOC
included, the system having five coupled degrees of free-
dom, possesses only three integrals of motion. As a re-
sult, it exhibits an unusual chaotic behavior as we shall
see below.

Since the comprehensive description of the Kepler tra-

jectories can be done with the t = 0 initial conditions

r(0) = (r0, 0),

p(0) = (0, p0),

(7)

we employ these conditions for subsequent analysis. We
will measure the energy in e2/r0 and momentum in

epm/r0 units respectively. The condition for the system
to be in a highly excited Rydberg state is r0 ≫ 2/me2.
In addition, in what follows we put  = m = e = 1. In
Eq. (7), p2
0/2 − 1 ≡ E0 is the initial energy in the SOC
absence, which determines the trajectory shape. In this
case, the initial angular momentum L(0) ≡p2 (1 + E0).
Note that E0 = −1/2 determines the special case of circu-
lar trajectory. Its special character will be demonstrated
below. The total conserved energy is E = E0− αp0¯σx(0).
We will vary the initial conditions by modifying the initial

Notations correspond to the text. Electron (e) starts to move
at the distance r(0) from the fixed hole (h) and at t = T /2,
where T is the rotation period, reaches the distance r(T /2).

The spin-independent part is:

,

(1)

where r = (x, y) is the electron coordinate, p is the elec-
tron momentum (see Fig. 1), m is its mass, and e is the
effective charge including the dielectric constant of a host
crystal. We take the SOC term in the Rashba form [22]
with rotational symmetry of the spectrum:

Hso =

α


(pxσy − pyσx) ,

(2)

with α being the coupling constant [24] and σi are the
Pauli matrices corresponding to spin 1/2. This type of
coupling appears as a result of either spatial inversion
asymmetry in solids [22, 23] or can be generated optically
in cold atomic gases [7, 8].

Although here we concentrate on the classical dynam-
ics, it is instructive to make a connection with the quan-
tum approach. Namely, we consider a system with two-
component wavefunction in the form:

ψ (r, t) = ϕ (r, t)(cid:20) cos (θ/2) eiφ

sin (θ/2)

(cid:21) .

(3)

Here ϕ(r, t) is the (spatial and temporal dependent)
wavepacket-like envelope function and time-dependent
angles θ and φ determine spin components as:

σz = cos θ,

σx = sin θ cos φ,

σy = − sin θ sin φ. (4)
Subsequently we assume the classical limit for orbital mo-
tion, while the spin remains quantum. To be specific,
here we characterize the orbital motion by the classical
coordinate r and momentum p, whereas quantum spin
defines the momentum-dependent precession [18, 23] and
related to this precession effects, as described below.

The characteristic feature of Hamiltonian (2) is the
anomalous spin-dependent velocity [25] (see Fig. 1) pre-
sented in the commutator form vso ≡ i[Hso, r]/ =
α (σy,−σx) /. Two other SOC characteristics [23] of
our interest are the spin precession with the rate 2pα/2

quent coupled spin-coordinate motion dependent on the
initial spin vector. We shall demonstrate numerically
that at sufficiently large α the chaotic trajectories emerge
in the system under consideration.

III. WEAK SPIN-ORBIT COUPLING:

TRAJECTORY DEFORMATION

We begin with the solution of equations of motion to
describe the trajectories at weak SOC. Here we can study
the dynamics by iterative procedure in α in Eqs. (5),(6)
with the elliptic Kepler trajectory and time-independent
spin as zero-order approximation. In this case the anoma-
lous velocity has two main effects on the trajectory shape:
(i) it shifts the position of the point r(T /2) (see Fig. 1)
and (ii) it rotates the entire trajectory (see Appendix A
for details). Based on the total angular momentum and
energy conservation, we present the position of the par-
ticle at t = T /2 as:

r(T /2) =

ZT /2 ∓qZ 2

L2(T /2)

T /2 + 2EL2(T /2)

,

(8)

where ZT /2 ≡ 1 − αL(T /2)¯σx(T /2), L(T /2) ≡ L(0) +
∆z, 2∆z ≡ ¯σz(0) − ¯σz(T /2), and the upper (lower) sign
corresponds to E0 > −1/2 (E0 < −1/2). At α = 0 we
have r(T /2) = R, where R ≡ −(E0 + 1)/E0 determines
the limit of the trajectory in the absence of the SOC, and
at finite α, we consider the shift r(T /2) − R. Analysis of
Eq. (8) shows that E0 = −1/2, where 1 + 2E0L2(0) = 0,
is the special case (see Appendix A for details), which
should be considered separately. To demonstrate the key
role of the initial conditions, we consider two cases which
are strongly different in terms of the anomalous initial
velocity.

We begin with ¯σx(0) = 1, where the initial velocity
is v(0) = (0, p − α). The first two iterations of Eqs.
(5), (6) yield the leading terms in the spin components
¯σz(T /2) = 2α (R + 1) and ¯σx(T /2) = 1−2α2 (R + 1)2. It

3

is seen that the main contribution in Eq. (8) comes from
¯σz(T /2), which is linear in α, and we may safely disregard
the ∼ α2 correction in ¯σx(T /2). Then, at 1 + 2E0 ≫ α,
the linear in α correction to the position becomes:

R − r(T /2) = −

(9)

The initial condition ¯σz(0) = 1 can be considered along
the same lines with v(0) = (0, p0) and E = E0. We
obtain two main contributions to the shape of the trajec-
tory: ¯σx(T /2) = −2(R + 1)/lso and ¯σz(T /2) = 1− 2(R +

(10)

To illustrate the deformation of the trajectories, in Fig.
2, we present them at a moderate SOC for different initial
conditions. The shapes of the trajectories correspond
well to Eqs. (9) and (10). At a sufficiently strong SOC,
corresponding to a small lso, the relevant quantities such
as deformations and rotations, become large, providing a
hint to possible chaotic behavior.

IV. CHAOS AND ORDER FROM DISORDER

AT STRONG COUPLING

Having discussed the effect of the relatively weak and
moderate SOC, we can establish a crossover from the
weak to a strong coupling regime. The qualitative effects
of strong SOC appear when α becomes of the order of
the minimal Kepler velocity, vmin. For simplicity we con-
sider the case E0 → −0. In this limit R = 1/E0 and
L(0) = √2, therefore, vmin = √2E0 and the criterion of
strong SOC becomes α & E0. However, there is a subtle
effect related to the role of the initial conditions - if the
anomalous velocity is initially zero, as in the ¯σz(0) = 1
case, it needs some time to be developed. Taking into
account that the spin precession yields ¯σx(T /2) ∼ αR,
here the condition of an immediate strong effect of SOC,
becomes α2R ∼ E0.
Now we can determine the critical value αc, which per-
mits ionization of the initial state and serves as a typical
SOC value where the chaotic regime can be seen. The
minimum of the SOC (2) eigenenergy E = −α2/2 occurs
at p = α, and the ionization is determined by the condi-
tion that the total energy E = E0 − αcp0¯σx(0) equals to
the SOC eigenenergy minimum

E0 − αcp0¯σx(0) = −

α2
c
2

.

(11)

The solution of Eq. (11) yields αc = u0 +pu2

0 − 2E0,
where u0 = p0¯σx(0), demonstrating a non-analytical de-
pendence of αc on the initial conditions.

For ¯σx(0) = 0 it is immediately seen that αc =

p2  E0, and this condition is stronger than α & E0.

mented by spin subspace. Note that ionization condition
E > −α2/2 is a necessary, but not sufficient one - even
when it is satisfied, the motion can still be finite, making
a qualitative difference from the behavior without SOC.
Indeed, at α = 0, when L is the integral of motion, the
dynamics can be reduced to one-dimensional form with
the effective potential energy Ueff(r) = −1/r + L2/2r2
[9] explicitly including L. This one-dimensional mapping
results in E0 > 0 being both the necessary and sufficient
condition for the ionization. For nonzero α such a map-
ping cannot be done and the condition E0 > −α2/2 is
not sufficient anymore.
Now we provide evidence for the chaotic behavior
based on numerical solutions of Eqs. (5) and (6). The
particle trajectories near the separatrix corresponding to
the critical SOC are presented in Fig. 3, demonstrating a
variety of behaviors. The minimal and maximal distance
reached by the particle in this case are determined by the
conservation laws. Figure 3, demonstrating all possible
behaviors of the SOC-augmented Kepler problem close
to the critical coupling, can be considered as the main
result of our analysis. These behaviors include:

Therefore, even when the trajectory is strongly modified
by the Rashba coupling, the motion can still be finite.

tively.

1) strongly entangled chaotic trajectories with "protu-
berances" in Figs. 3(a), (b), (e), (g), and (h), as expected
from the fact that the number of the integrals of motion
is less than the number of the degrees of freedom;

2) stable unperiodic orbits filling regular ring-like areas
in the (xy)−plane in Figs. 3(c) and (d). This behavior re-
sembles the trajectories in a system with a non-Coulomb
potential U (r) as presented, e.g., in Ref. [9], demonstrat-
ing a stability point in the Kepler problem with SOC, and
3) relatively simple trajectories corresponding to the

exciton ionization in Fig. 3(f).

At large distances, r ≫ πlso, the influence of Coulomb
potential on the velocity is negligible compared to that of
the spin-orbit coupling. Hence, in this case the electron
motion is almost completely defined by SOC. Latter fact
permits analytical description of both the trajectories like
rare protuberances, where electron still returns to the
chaotic region with r . πlso, and ionization ones with
r → ∞. Without loss of generality, here we concentrate
on the case of the particle characterized by weakly time-
dependent momentum, which we consider for definiteness
to be constant in time as p = p (cos θ, sin θ). The total
energy now consists of two constant terms: the kinetic
energy p2/2 and the SOC-related contribution

ǫso = α (px ¯σy(0) − py ¯σx(0)) .

(13)

Hence, the precession of the SOC-induced spin compo-
nent parallel to the momentum p ¯σ reads:

p ¯σ(t) = p ¯σ(0) cos(cid:0)2αpt(cid:1) , t ≡ t − t0,

(14)

where t0 is the initial time for the constant-p motion. By
solving these equations we obtain the velocities vx(t) =

px + α¯σy(t) and vy(t) = py − α¯σx(t):

vx(t) = px + αh¯σy(e0)f1(t) − ¯σx(e0)f2(t)i ,
vy(t) = py − αh¯σx(e0)f3(t) − ¯σy(e0)f2(t)i ,

5

(15)

where f1(t) = 1−2 sin2 θ sin2 φ, f2(t) = sin 2θ sin2 φ, and
f3(t) = 1 − 2 cos2 θ sin2 φ with φ ≡ αpt. As we can see
from Eqs.(15), the motion has an oscillatory character
corresponding to Fig. 3.

Equations (15) have an interesting limit. Consider par-
ticle with momentum p = α. Then, the energy E =
α2/2+α2 (cos θ¯σy(0) − sin θ¯σx(0)) has the minimum E =
−α2/2 at ¯σy(0) = − cos θ, ¯σx(0) = sin θ. Slightly away
from the minimum by taking: ¯σy(0) = − cos (θ + η) ,
¯σx(0) = sin (θ + η) with small η ≪ 1 we obtain vx =
αη sin θ cos(cid:0)2α2t(cid:1) and vy = −αη cos θ cos(cid:0)2α2t(cid:1) . Here
the nonzero velocity appears only due to deviation of the
energy from −α2/2 with E = −α2(cid:0)1 − η2(cid:1) /2. This cor-

responds to small but fast oscillations in the "protuber-
ances" in Fig. 3. These oscillations are an extreme mani-
festation of a Zitterbewegung [27, 28] typical for spin-orbit
coupled systems.

An important characteristic feature of a chaotic motion
such as strong dependence on the initial conditions is
presented in Fig. 4. It clearly demonstrates a transition
from chaotic to confined regular trajectory (Fig. 4(a))
in the stability domain and vice versa (Fig. 4(b)) at
small variations in the initial spin direction. The stability
point here is approximately ¯σx(0) = −0.91. Note that
the chaotic trajectories reported in Fig. 4(a) and (b)
(corresponding to ¯σx(0) = −0.9 and 0.92 respectively)
are qualitatively similar to those in Fig. 3(b) since the
value of α is larger than the critical αc obtained with Eq.
(11) for both initial spin orientations.

In general, the trajectory shape depends on the SOC
strength and the entire set of the initial conditions, mak-
ing the analysis very cumbersome. To obtain a semi-
quantitative pattern of different regimes of the motion,
the domain of initial conditions in Fig. 4 can be extended
to the entire ¯σx(0) = (−1, 1) domain. The results are pre-
sented in Fig. 5 for two values of the constant α. This
Figure shows a gradual development of chaos-related fea-
tures such as increasing entanglement of the trajectories
and length of the protuberances following the regular be-
havior and can be regarded as a "stability diagram" of
the system under consideration. Another important fea-
ture, which already follows from Fig. 4, is a reentrance of
regular trajectories from chaotic ones and vice versa near
the threshold values ¯σcr
x (0). Latter effect can be consid-
ered as "order from disorder" driven by variation in the
initial spin direction.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the emergence of chaos in the clas-
sical Kepler problem with the Rashba spin-orbit cou-
pling. Such systems can be experimentally realized, for

instance, in highly excited Rydberg-like states of two-
dimensional excitons in semiconductor structures. At a
weak Rashba coupling, corresponding to small interac-
tion constants α, the elliptic Kepler trajectories are mod-
ified in shape and orientation and densely fill a part of the
particle motion plane. This behavior is somewhat simi-
lar, although not identical, to that of the Kepler problem
trajectories in the potentials −1/rb, where b > 0 and
b 6= 1 [9]. With the increase in α, the deformations of
the trajectories become strong and in the vicinity of the
critical αc corresponding to the exciton breakdown, the
trajectories can become chaotic. Typical chaotic trajec-
tory can be described as a highly entangled path in the
vicinity of the initial position with rare long protuber-
ances increasing in length at approaching the ionization
threshold. At a sufficiently large α, the SOC assisted ion-
ization becomes possible and the bound state disappears.
The reason for the chaos lies in the fact that the system
lost integrability since in possesses only to integrals of
motion for its four degrees of freedom. Dynamically, this
effect is clearly seen in the equations of motion including
the anomalous spin-dependent velocity term.

As typical for a chaotic system, its dynamics exhibits
a critical dependence on the initial conditions, demon-
strating the transition from a chaotic to a regular be-
havior and vice versa caused by very small variations in
the initial spin orientation. The latter feature could be
referred to as reentrant "order-from-disorder" transition.
Our results can have important implications for the prop-
erties of semiclassical Rydberg-like states of excitons in
two-dimensional structures, where a chaotic regime due
to spin-orbit coupling may be developed.

To make relation to possible observations, we mention
that the typical energies of highly excited Rydberg 2D ex-

6

citons in semiconductor quantum wells are of the order of
0.1 meV and the size is around 100 nm [29]. Therefore, a
typical length of the chaotic protuberances is about 103
nm (1 µm) and a typical time the electron spends in a
long protuberance is about a nanosecond. We mention
here several realizations, where predicted chaotic trajec-
tories can play a role. For example, they can be relevant
for interaction between distant 2D excitons. Indeed, the
long-range chaotic trajectories presented in Fig. 3 are
characterized by large dipole moments er(t), enhancing
long-range electric fields of the excitons. The chaotic tra-
jectories of electrons from different excitons can interlace,
which alters the exciton-exciton interaction leading either
to their ionization or to a modified lateral motion. In ad-
dition, this chaotic behavior can strongly influence relax-
ation of electron energy in the Rydberg excitons by emis-
sion of phonons. Instead of a process with well-defined
time dependence, the energy relaxation from a highly ex-
cited to the ground state may become chaotic and largely
unpredictable. Moreover, the electrons at those remote
trajectories, can eventually be trapped in distant electro-
static fields (e.g. Ref. [30]) or at the system boundaries.

Appendix A: Trajectory shape at weak spin-orbit

coupling

Based on the energy and angular momentum conservation, we calculate the particle's position at t = T /2. At this

time instant, the energy can be written as:

E =

p2 (T /2)

+ αp (T /2) ¯σx(T /2) −

r (T /2)

, p(T /2) =

L(T /2)
r(T /2)

.

The total angular momentum conservation yields L (T /2) = L(0) + (¯σz(0) − ¯σz(T /2)) /2. Thus, we obtain:

(L(0) + ∆z)2

r2 (T /2)

+

r (T /2)

(α (L(0) + ∆z) σx(T /2) − 1) − 2E = 0,

(A1)

(A2)

where ∆z ≡ (¯σz(0) − ¯σz(T /2)) /2. The solution of (A2) with respect to r(T /2) yields

r (T /2) =

1 − α (L(0) + ∆z) ¯σx(T /2) ∓q(α(L(0) + ∆z)¯σx(T /2) − 1)2 + 2E (L(0) + ∆z)2

(L(0) + ∆z)2

,

(A3)

where upper (lower) sign corresponds to E0 > −1/2 (E0 < −1/2). This equation is tantamount to Eq. (8) of the
main text.
Now we apply Eq. (A3) to the initial conditions ¯σx(0) = 1, where E = E0−αp2 (1 + E0), and L(0) =p2 (1 + E0).

The equations for spin precession with respect to anomalous velocity read:

¯σx = 2α (vx − α¯σy) ¯σz;

¯σy = −2α (vy + α¯σx) ¯σz;

¯σz = −2α (vx ¯σx + vy ¯σy) .

FIG. 6. Particle trajectory for different values of SOC constant as shown in the panels. (a) Moderate α with the trajectory
filling the allowed part of the (xy) plane, (b) a chaotic trajectory at α close to but smaller than the critical value, and (c)
ionization trajectory at α > αc. In all panels E0 = −0.7 and initial spin ¯σx(0) = −1.

We begin with the time dependence of ¯σz(t) and obtain

¯σz(t) = −2α (x(t) − x(0)) ≡ −2α (x(t) − 1) ,

(A5)

resulting in ¯σz(T /2) = 2α (R + 1) and L(T /2) = L(0)−σz(T /2)/2 = L−α (R + 1) . Second iteration yields ¯σx(T /2) =
1 − 2 (α (R + 1))2 , providing the contribution which is not important for the linear in α approximation. Assuming
E0 > −1/2, for this case we obtain

r (T /2) =

1 − α (L(0) − α (R + 1)) −q(α (L(0) − α (R + 1)) − 1)2 + 2E (L(0) − α (R + 1))2

(L(0) − α (R + 1))2

.

(A6)

Equation (9) of the main text immediately follows from the above Eq. (A6).

Now we express (α (L(0) − α (R + 1)) − 1)2 + 2E (L(0) − α (R + 1))2 in terms of the energy E0 and obtain

(α (L(0) − α (R + 1)) − 1)2 + 2E (L(0) − α (R + 1))2 =
= (1 + 2E0)2 − 2αL(0) (1 + 2E0) + α2(cid:18)p2 (1 + E0) − 8

1 + E0

E0 (cid:19) + O(α3).

(A7)

Therefore, at 1 + 2E0 = 0, the corresponding circular trajectory cannot be treated perturbatively and the condition
1 + 2E0 ≫ α is required for the applicability of the perturbation theory at given α ≪ 1.

Appendix B: Trajectories at E0 < −1/2.

In the main text, we have considered three principal realizations of trajectories with E0 ≥ −1/2 as shown in Fig.3
there. Here we complement the corresponding analysis by typical results for E0 < −1/2 at different values of the
SOC constant. Figure 6 shows that the behavior of trajectories corresponds to the chaos emergence near the critical
αc = √2(1 − √1 + E0), followed by exciton ionization with α increase. This result follows from the general analysis

in the main text.
