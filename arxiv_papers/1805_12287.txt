Abstract 

The origin of the variation of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of monolayer tungsten 

disulfide  (WS2)  is  investigated  systematically.  Dependence  of  the  PL  spectrum  on  the 

excitation power show that the relatively sharp component corresponds to excitons whereas the 

broader  component  at  slightly  lower  energy  corresponds  to  negatively  charged  trions.  PL 

imaging  and  second  harmonic  generation  measurements  show  that  the  trion  signals  are 

suppressed  more  than  the  exciton  signals  near  the  edges,  thereby  relatively  enhancing  the 

excitonic feature in the PL spectrum and that such relative enhancement of the exciton signals 

is more pronounced near approximately armchair edges. This effect is interpreted in terms of 

depletion  of  free  electrons  near  the  edges  caused  by  structural  defects  and  adsorption  of 

electron acceptors such as oxygen atoms.

1. Introduction 

Two-dimensional (2D) layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted 

much interest recently owing to remarkable 2D physical properties that may be useful for novel 

device applications. For example, field effect transistors based on TMDs have shown a high 

on-off ratio [1]. Also, strong luminescence from many monolayer TMDs due to a direct band 

gap  and  a  large  exciton  binding  energy  [2-6]  may  also  be  advantageous  for  nanoscale 

optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting devices [7, 8], photodetectors [9], or solar cells 

[10].  In  addition,  an  optical  logic  gate  by  selective  control  of  light  helicity  [11]  has  been 

demonstrated by utilizing the valley degree of freedom in TMDs [12-15]. Tungsten disulfide 

(WS2) is one of the most studied TMDs and is frequently used to study valley effects or to 

make heterostructures with other TMDs. 

The optical properties of TMDs are often dominated by the excitonic features because of 

large exciton binding energies owing to strong Coulomb interaction due to reduced screening 

in 2D materials [2-5]. Thanks to the strong Coulomb interaction, trions, a bound state of an 

exciton and an electron or a hole, are often observed with binding energies of tens of meV's [2, 

16]. Because of the excitonic nature of the photoluminescence (PL), PL characterizations are 

used routinely to identify the number of layers or to estimate the quality of TMDs samples, etc. 

However, the reported PL spectra of monolayer WS2 sample show a large variation [17, 18] 

unlike the case of MoS2. At room temperature, monolayer WS2 usually have strong PL signals 

at ~2.0 eV. Whereas some samples show a broad PL peak, others have a sharp peak at a slightly 
2 

 

higher energy. In this paper, we try to clarify the origin of the variations by analyzing the 

excitation power dependence and spatial variation of the PL spectra of monolayer WS2 samples. 

 

2. Materials and methods 

Monolayer WS2 samples were prepared by mechanically exfoliating single crystal WS2 

flakes (HQ Graphene) onto Si substrates with a 285-nm SiO2 layer. The number of layer was 

confirmed  by  combination  of  optical  contrast  and  Raman  spectroscopy.  Raman  and  PL 

measurements were carried out using a home-built confocal microscope system using the 488-

nm (2.54 eV) line of an Ar+ laser and the 514.4-nm (2.41 eV) line of a diode-pumped-solid-

state (DPSS) laser, respectively. The laser beam was focused onto a sample by a 50× objective 

lens (0.8 N.A.). The scattered light was collected and collimated by the same objective lens, 

dispersed by a Jobin-Yvon Horiba iHR550 spectrometer (2400 grooves/mm for Raman and 300 

grooves/mm  for  PL),  and  detected  with  a  liquid-nitrogen-cooled  back-illuminated  charge-

coupled-device (CCD) detector. The laser power was kept at 50 µW to avoid damaging the 

sample,  except  for  the  excitation  power  dependence  measurements.  A  microscope-based 

polarized second harmonic generation (SHG) system, described elsewhere in detail [19], was 

used to determine the crystallographic orientation of the sample. Briefly, a 140-fs Ti:sapphire 

laser (Coherent, Chameleon) with a wavelength of 820 nm and a repetition rate of 80 MHz was 

focused onto a 1.0-µm spot with a 40× objective. The SHG signal centered at 410 nm was 

collected  by  same  objective  lens  and  guided  to  a  spectrograph  (Andor,  Shamrock  303i) 

equipped with a thermoelectrically cooled CCD (Andor, Newton). The angle between the WS2 

lattice and the laser polarization was varied by rotating the sample on a rotation stage with 

accuracy better than 0.2. Parallel or perpendicular polarization of SHG signal was selected by 

an analyzer in front of the spectrograph.

3. Results and discussion 

3.1 Variation of PL spectra from monolayer WS2 samples 

Figures 1(a) and (b) show optical images and Raman spectra of three monolayer WS2 

samples. The E′ and A1′ modes, which correspond to the E2g1 and A1g modes due to intra-layer 

vibrations along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions in bulk WS2, are observed at ~356 

and ~417 cm–1, respectively [20, 21]. The separation between the two peaks (~61 cm–1) is 

consistent with the literature value for monolayer WS2 [20-22]. Figure 1(c) shows PL spectra 

of the three samples. There is a large variation in the peak position and the line shape. Residual 

strain or variations in doping density influence the PL spectrum of TMDs materials [23, 24]. 

For example, the A1′ mode, which is sensitive to doping [23], is slightly red-shifted in the 

Raman spectrum of sample 1 with respect to those in the other two spectra, which indicates 

that  there  is  some  doping.  The  different  line  shapes  also  indicate  that  the  contributions  of 

different components of the PL vary among samples. In order to find the origin of the PL 

spectrum variations, we studied sample 3 in more detail.

3.2 Excitation power dependence of PL   

Figure 2(a) shows the dependence of the PL spectrum from sample 3 on the excitation 

laser power from 5 to 200 µW. At low excitation powers, the spectrum is dominated by a 

relatively sharp peak at ~2.02 eV. A much weaker signal is seen at a lower energy of ~1.98 eV. 

As the excitation power increased, the lower energy peak grows much faster than the higher 

energy peak. The PL spectra were deconvoluted using a double-Lorentzian function, and the 

results are summarized in Figs. 2(b) and (c). The intensity reversal and the peak position shift 

are consistent with reported behaviors of exciton and trion peaks from WS2. The PL signal 

from trions, bound states of two electrons and a hole or one electron and two holes, usually 

increase more rapidly than the exciton PL [25, 26]. Furthermore, the trion states tend to redshift 

at higher excitation power due to the shift of the Fermi level [25-28]. Because WS2 samples 

5 

 

without intentional doping are n-type [29], the trions are negatively charged. Therefore, we 

assign the higher energy peak to the exciton (X) recombination and the lower energy one to the 

negatively charged trion (X–) recombination.

excitation power, respectively. 

 

3.3 Spatial variation of PL 

In order to study the spatial variation of the PL spectrum from monolayer WS2, we carried 

out PL imaging of sample 3. Figure 3(a) show PL spectra taken from the area marked by a 

white-dashed box in Fig. 3(b) in 1-µm steps. Results of deconvolution into double Lorentzian 

are also shown. The relative intensities of exciton and trion signals vary: trion seems to be 

stronger in the middle of the sample. For better comparison, we carried out PL imaging of the 

area in Fig. 3(b) in 0.5-µm steps and deconvoluted the exciton and trion components from each 

spectrum.  Figures  3(c)  and  (d)  show  the  intensity  maps  of  exciton  and  trion  PL  signals, 

respectively,  and  Fig.  3(e)  is  the  ratio  of  the  former  to  the  latter.  Although  the  intensity  is 

stronger in the middle part of the sample for both exciton and trion signals, the exciton signal 

6 

 

is relatively stronger near the edges, which is what we see in Fig. 3(a). Due to structural defects 

near the edges, it is reasonable to expect that the PL signal is reduced near the edges. In order 

to see if the enhancement of the exciton to trion ratio at the edges has any correlation with the 

orientation of the edges, we carried out second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. 

Since the intensity of the SHG signal is strongly sensitive to the relative angle between the 

principal  axis  of  the  crystal  and  the  polarization  of  the  incident  light  [30-33],  the 

crystallographic  orientation  of  the  sample  can  be  determined  from  polarized  SHG 

measurements.  Figure  4(b)  shows  the  polarization  dependence  of  the  SHG  signal  with  the 

relative angle θ−θ0 defined in Fig. 4(c). The maximum signal in parallel polarization (minimum 

in cross polarization) corresponds to the armchair direction [30-33]. Figure 4(c) is an overlay 

of  the  determined  crystallographic  directions  with  Fig.  3(e).  It  appears  that  the  relative 

enhancement of the exciton signal is stronger for approximately armchair edges. Since free 

electrons in addition to excitons are required to form negatively charged trions, the enhanced 

exciton  signal  or  equivalently,  suppression  of  the  trion  signal  is  an  indication  of  reduced 

electron density near the edges. This is reasonable because presence of trap states due to a large 

density of structural defects near the edges would inevitably reduce the density of free carriers. 

Oxygen  chemisorption  or  physisorption  is  often  cited  as  the  main  mechanism  for  reduced 

electron density as oxygen atoms act as acceptors [34-40]. The observation that the effect seems 

to  be  stronger  near  approximately  armchair  edges  imply  that  such  chemisorption  or 

physisorption is more effective near such edges. Although there is no systematic studies yet on 

the different sensitivity to chemisorption or physisorption at different edge types of WS2, we 

would like to point to similar work on graphene in which it was found that the armchair edges 

tend to be more chemically active [41, 42].

4. Conclusions 

PL  measurements  have  shown  that  the  PL  spectrum  of  monolayer  WS2  is  a 

convolution of signals from excitons and trions, and the ratio between them varies in 

different  samples  or  in  different  areas  of  the  same  sample.  From  PL  imaging 

measurements, we found that the trion signal is more suppressed than the exciton signal 

near  edges  of  monolayer  WS2,  resulting  in  spectra  with  enhanced  exciton  signals. 

Polarized SHG measurements show that such relative enhancement of the exciton signal 

is more  pronounced near approximately armchair edges. The  suppression  of trions is 

attributed  to  reduction  of  free  electron  density  due  to  structural  defects  near  edges 

through chemisorption or physisorption of adsorbates such as oxygen atoms.
