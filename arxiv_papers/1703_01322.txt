Abstract

Three dimensional topological insulators are bulk insulators with Z2 topological electronic order

that gives rise to conducting light-like surface states. These surface electrons are exceptionally

resistant to localization by non-magnetic disorder, and have been adopted as the basis for a wide

range of proposals to achieve new quasiparticle species and device functionality. Recent stud-

ies have yielded a surprise by showing that in spite of resisting localization, topological insulator

surface electrons can be reshaped by defects into distinctive resonance states. Here we use nu-

merical simulations and scanning tunneling microscopy data to show that these resonance states

have significance well beyond the localized regime usually associated with impurity bands. At

native densities in the model Bi2X3 (X=Bi, Te) compounds, defect resonance states are predicted

to generate a new quantum basis for an emergent electron gas that supports diffusive electrical

transport.

Three dimensional topological insulators (TI) with the chemical formula M2X3 (M=Bi,

Sb; X=Se, Te) are characterized by a single-Dirac-cone surface state [1 -- 3], and have been

widely investigated as model materials for TI surface physics. Shortly after the discovery of

the first TI's, it was established that standard effects of defect disorder such as backscat-

tering and localization are greatly suppressed in TI surface states [4 -- 11]. Together with the

intuition that topological properties of band structure should be inherently impervious to

weak perturbations, this led to a pervasive characterization that topological interfaces are

essentially blind to the presence of non-magnetic defects. It is only with the recent advent

of more detailed non-perturbative numerical investigations and targeted scanning tunneling

microscopy (STM) experiments [12 -- 25] that elements of this picture have been overturned.

It is now known that, rather than being blind to defects, topological Dirac cone electrons

actually bind loosely to atomic point defects in energy levels that fall very close to the

Dirac point (see states labeled "resonance" in Fig. 1b), and can radically redefine electronic

structure relevant to the Dirac transport regime.

In isotropic Dirac models of TI surface states, strongly perturbing non-magnetic defects

are theoretically expected to create circular s-wave resonance states, such as those plotted in

Fig. 1a. Experimentally, these states have been observed in STM measurements of density of

states (DOS) immediately above the Dirac point of topological insulator Bi2Se3 (see Fig. 1a

(left) inset patch). Three bright spots in the STM image represent coherent interference with
a slight <∼1% admixture of f-wave symmetry (See Supplementary Note 2) due to anisotropy
not considered in the accompanying simulation. The combined impact of multiple randomly

distributed defects on the electronic structure has not yet been evaluated, and is the subject

of the present work.

Theoretical treatments of lattice defects are usually carried out in the single impurity

approximation, since multiple impurities do not lead to emergent coherent bandstructures.

Large modifications to the band structure of non-TI materials are only achieved through

heterostructure growth or fractional alloying. The "impurity bands" associated with elec-

trons on minority impurity sites are generally disregarded as being non-ideal for electronic

transport. These bands exhibit miniscule dispersions, and strong defect potentials or re-

duced dimensionality cause the electronic states to be Anderson localized [26, 27] over rel-

evant device lengthscales. A typical example is the well-studied manganese impurity band

in Ga1−xMnxAs, whose dispersion across the Brillouin zone is far smaller than its intrinsic

2

width along the energy axis, meaning that the electrons are effectively localized to isolated

lattice sites [28, 29].

In the following, in contrast, we find that uncompensated lattice defects at low densities

(ρ < 0.1%) in non-amorphous TIs provide a mechanism for band structure engineering that

is not shared in a conventional semiconducting system. Theoretically, it is expected that

Anderson localization will be forbidden on the TI surface with non-magnetic impurities

[30 -- 34] and backscattering is suppressed relative to forward scattering [4, 5, 9], leading to

greater itinerancy for impurity-derived band structure. Moreover, the electronic density of

states falls to zero at a surface Dirac point, making it possible for defect resonance states

to dominate the absolute density of states. In the following discussions we will show that

these conditions enable new defect-derived electronic dispersions, providing viable channels

for diffusive electrical transport. We also find that these emergent electronic band structures

can superficially appear to be gapped, and resemble Dirac point anomalies that have been

seen by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in TI compounds that have no

known time reversal symmetry broken ground state [35 -- 38].

RESULTS

Defect resonance states of Dirac electrons

We will focus on defect resonance states in the popular Bi2Se3−xTex family of single-Dirac-

cone TIs [1 -- 3], so as to make quantitative comparisons to STM measurements. However, our

results are applicable to other TI surface states with isolated Dirac cones. In this material
family, structural point defects tend to occur with a density of ρ <∼ 0.1% per formula unit,
and have been found to overlap with the surface state in the outermost quintuple layer

of the lattice [15, 39] (see Supplementary Note 1).

Intensive characterization of Bi2Se3

has found that the density and type-range of defects can be tuned over a broad range by

adjusting sample growth conditions [39]. For Se-poor and stoichiometric synthesis, defects

near a cleaved surface are predominantly selenium vacancies positioned in the center of the

outermost quintuple layer of the lattice. Interstitial atoms and replacement defects can be

common at the surface of Se-rich or quench-cooled samples. The chemical potential can be

shifted as a separate parameter via methods that include bulk doping, surface dosing, and

3

electrostatic gating [40 -- 43].

Defect resonance states have been observed by STM less than 200 meV above the surface

Dirac point, surrounding point defects [14, 15] and at step edges between plateaus differing

in height by one quintuple layer [18, 19]. Characteristic local density of states (LDOS)

distributions measured by STM at the defect lattice sites are plotted as black curves in

Fig. 2b-c. Theoretical analyses of isolated local impurities have shown that these resonance

states arise naturally when strong scalar potentials are introduced to a surface occupied by

spin-helical TI Dirac cone electrons [12, 13, 15 -- 17]. For an isolated defect described as a

point potential with amplitude U , the resonance state is split from the Dirac point by an
energy roughly proportional to −U−1.

In the following, we numerically approach the problem of multiple impurity scattering on

the surface states of TIs with a single Dirac cone, which is otherwise theoretically intractable.

We use a basis of spinor plane waves [44] on a discrete hexagonal real-space lattice, with
lattice parameter a = 4.2A corresponding to Bi2Se3−xTex surface atomic spacings. We have
used the impurity-free spin-helical Hamiltonian, Hk = v0(k× σ), with Dirac velocity v0=3.0
eV·A chosen to be intermediate between Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3.

When a large surface with a typical ρ ∼ 0.06% defect density is modeled in this way,
we find that approximately 2 electronic states per defect are added near the Dirac point

(see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4), resulting in a new DOS peak that

becomes increasingly visible as the defect potential grows (Fig. 2a). Isolating the LDOS at
defect cores on Bi2Se3 reveals that a defect potential of U = −45 eV accurately reproduces
the resonance state energy and LDOS line shape obtained in STM studies, which is plotted

in Fig. 2b. The very different experimental line shape of a step edge defect can likewise

be reproduced by considering the tunneling barrier generated with a repulsive potential of

U = 3.8 eV applied to each atom along the step edge path (Fig. 2c). These comparisons are

evidence that our numerical approach is able to quantitatively capture the physics observed

in experiments.

New delocalized electronic structure

The resonance states associated with this defect distribution reveal a novel structure in

the momentum-resolved electron annihilation (ARPES) spectral function, modeled in Fig.

4

2d-f. The resonance itself shows up as a discontinuity in the ARPES spectral function.

As the defect potential strength increases, the surface Dirac point (termed D0) as well as

the discontinuity associated with the resonance state LDOS maximum (ER) move down in
energy (Fig. 3h). When the defect potential crosses a critical value of U <∼ −45 eV, a new
local maximum appears in the spectrum at K = 0 (Γ point), roughly 50 meV above the

D0 Dirac point, and will henceforth be referred to as 'D1'. As the defect resonance state

converges on E = 0 eV with increasing potential strength, the region between D0 and D1

begins to qualitatively resemble a band gap, as has been seen at the Dirac point of TI crystals

with non-magnetic defects in Ref.

[35, 36]. Unlike a true band gap, which is theoretically

disallowed [6], the momentum-integrated total DOS distribution contains a local maximum

within the seemingly gapped region (Fig. 2a).

A remarkable evolution of the electronic structure also occurs when the defect density

is increased (see Fig. 3a-c series). When the defect density is tripled to ρ = 0.18%, the

faint local maximum D1 becomes the dispersion minimum of an upper band that is clearly

disconnected from the D0 Dirac cone. The D0 upper Dirac cone maintains its dispersion for
small momenta K <∼ 0.02A, out to more than 50meV from the Dirac point, and becomes
dispersionless at larger momenta, as would be expected for a more typical impurity band.

For all of these impurity densities, the upper D0 Dirac cone dispersion is significantly larger
than the energy axis intrinsic width, which is δE ∼ 0.02 and 0.04 eV at half maximum
intensity in Fig. 3b-c, respectively.

Higher defect densities are also associated with further lowering of the D0 Dirac point

energy. An STM map obtained on a Se vacancy-rich Bi2Se3−δ surface shows that spatial

fluctuations in the energy of the D0 LDOS minimum are highly correlated with defect
density (see Fig. 3e). Simulating the observed Se vacancies with a U = −45 defect potential
reproduces the qualitative spatial distribution of the D0 LDOS minimum (Fig. 3f). These
modeling results can be plotted in the same ±25 meV range as the STM data, showing
that the energy scale of fluctuations is accurately captured, even though fine details may be

inconsistent due to missing information about defects outside of the STM map, or deeper in

the crystal. We note that the spatial distribution of defects observed by STM is very uniform

and uncorrelated, and is not readily distinguished from the random defect configurations

used in our simulations (see Poisson distribution overlay in Supplementary Fig. 1).

The emergence of new spectral features at high defect density is closely related to the

5

fraction of states near the Dirac point that can be attributed as defect resonance states. In

the absence of defects, the total number of states within an energy E of the Dirac point is

√

4πv0

2

(cid:113) 8πv0

NE =
, where N is the total number of 2D surface lattice sites. Setting NE equal to
the approximate number of resonance states (NE = NR ≡ 2ρN ) gives a new energy scale,
E∗ =
2ρ√
3a2 , which we find to have a novel physical significance. As can be see in Fig.
3g-h, we find that a local maximum associated with the emergent D1 feature becomes visible
when the resonance state energy ER becomes smaller than E∗. These simulations also reveal
that the resonance energy may be tuned not only by changing the impurity strength, as has

been theoretically predicted before, but also by increasing the impurity concentration, a

fact that is technologically significant because the impurity strength is usually not tunable.
With the experimentally fitted defect potential U = −45 eV, the resonance energy crosses
E∗ when the defect density becomes larger than ρ = 0.02%, resulting in the easily visible
emergent features in Fig. 3b-c.

To evaluate the ability of the emergent coherent impurity band-like features to carry
mobile charge, we have calculated the twist velocity, vθ, for configurations with 300×300 sites
(300 sites = 126nm/side). These are shown in Figs. 3a-c as vectors overlaid at local maxima

of the modeled ARPES spectrum. The twist velocity of a quantum state is proportional to

the magnitude of a persistent DC current carried by that state in the presence of an electric

field (see Methods), and in the scattering-free limit is equivalent to the group velocity of the

electronic band. It is calculated as the gradient of the state energies with respect to a phase

twist around the system boundary.

We find that the twist velocities of band features at energies E > 0 eV have similar

amplitudes, and are approximately proportional to the apparent slope in momentum space,

suggesting that all of these features are viable bands for charge transport. However, twist

velocities decay towards zero as the upper D0 Dirac cone disperses into the seemingly gapped
region beneath the D1 feature, particularly at momenta of k >∼ 0.05A, and this may greatly
limit carrier mobility for certain values of the chemical potential (see evaluation of twist and

band velocities in Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig.

3). Velocities are relatively large in the lower D0 Dirac cone, where states are energetically

distant from the resonance states, and maximal velocities are found immediately beneath

D0, where elastic scattering is minimal due to the vanishing density of states near a 2D

Dirac point.

6

For comparison, a similar simulation with magnetic defects instead of a U = −45 eV scalar
field is shown in Fig. 3d, representing a case in which the topological protection against

Anderson localization is expected to fail [45]. We have approximated each magnetic defect

by a localized J = 45 eV exchange field perfectly aligned with the +z-axis, perpendicular to

the surface (see Methods). In this magnetic scenario, even though disorder of the magnetic

moment vectors has been neglected, twist velocities are still reduced by an additional order

of magnitude near the Dirac point due to Anderson localization.

We have also investigated the transport characteristics of the potential disorder-induced

band structure by an alternate metric, the participation ratios of the quantum eigenstates.

The participation ratio [46, 47] of an electronic wavefunction is the sum of squares of the

site-resolved probability densities (see Methods). For itinerant electronic states that can

participate in electronic transport, it decays as the inverse of the total number of sites in
the system (N−1), for large system sizes. On the other hand, for localized states, the partic-
ipation ratio converges on a non-zero value as system size increases beyond the localization

length of the wavefunction. The participation ratios of the energy eigenstates in the pres-

ence of scalar and magnetic disorder are compared in Fig. 4. We find that in the latter

case, Anderson localized states around the resonances display large participation ratios that

saturate with system size (Fig. 4e), while topological protection against localization ensures

that the participation ratios for the comparable scalar potential disorder case vary inversely

as the system size, for large system sizes (Fig. 4b). Calculating the twist velocities for larger

system sizes shows a similar trend (Fig. 4c,f), in which scalar defect potentials allow diffusive
>∼ L−1), being topologically protected against Anderson localization, unlike
conventional impurity bands, represented here by the same surface states in the presence of

transport (vθ

magnetic disorder of comparable strength.

DISCUSSION

Impurity-induced carrier control is the cornerstone of the semiconductor industry, and

band structure engineering via disorder is the natural successor of such disorder-induced

functionalization of electronic materials. In conventional 2D materials, Anderson localization

prevents impurity bands from acting as viable carriers for diffusive charge transport. In this

work, we have shown that this restriction is ameliorated in the surface states of topological

7

insulators, in the presence of moderate potential disorder that does not break time reversal

symmetry. Using numerical techniques verified by comparison to experimental observations,

we have demonstrated that a new impurity band structure emerges in the TI surface states in

the presence of scalar potential disorder, and that these states remain diffusive and are able to

participate in transport processes. We have contrasted this novel behavior, when topological

protection against localization is present, to the more conventional situation when magnetic

disorder of comparable strength is present, when Anderson localization prevents diffusive

transport in the impurity band.

Our results also shed light on some less understood DOS anomalies on TI surface states

that have been reported in the literature. ARPES experiments have previously resolved gap-

like features [35 -- 37] and Dirac point elongation [38] in the spectrum of TI surface states, in

the absence of any time-reversal breaking effects. The experiment in Ref.

[37] presents a

particularly telling case. In this work, incident photon polarization was tuned to eliminate

the dominant even-symmetry photoemission channel from Bi2Se3 along the high symmetry
Γ − M axis. Defect resonance states do not have spatial reflection symmetry due to their
random distribution, and would not be intrinsically suppressed by this symmetry factor.

This defect-sensitive measurement geometry revealed a gap-like dispersion, with the upper

Dirac cone bands appearing to converge more than E > 50 meV above the Dirac point, as

expected from our calculations for the D1 feature.

We have shown that these observations may be attributed to the effects discussed above,

arising from scalar potential disorder alone. The emergent band structure associated with

defects is very narrowly separated from nearby bands in momentum, and will be difficult to

cleanly resolve in ARPES experiments. The energy-axis widths of bands in our calculations

are 2-3 times narrower than those actually observed in Bi2Se3, indicating that factors not

considered here such as phonon scattering and surface inhomogeneity may play a significant

role in the low energy physics, and may obscure the role of defect-derived states.

Nonetheless, the existence of defect resonance states immediately above the Dirac point

of these compounds is well known from STM measurements, and the new physics discussed

in this work are direct consequences of the interplay between these resonance states and

other established elements of TI surface physics. The numerical evaluations of electron

mobility and localization discussed above show that the emergent band structure identified

in these simulations is viable as a basis for conductivity, and that band structure engineering

8

is possible via non-magnetic defects in a TI system, driven by unique factors such as the

lack of Anderson localization and the vanishing of DOS near a 2D Dirac point.

METHODS

Energetics and state basis at the TI surface

STM data and LDOS curves were obtained by the procedures described in Ref. [15, 18].

The surface state is modeled as a spin-helical 2D Dirac cone occupying a discrete hexag-

onal real-space lattice with repeating boundary conditions, and is essentially a discretized
version of the model in Ref. [13, 15]. The kinetic Hamiltonian is given by Hk = v0(k × σ),
with velocity v0=3.0 eV chosen to be intermediate between Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. The real

space basis includes two spin-degenerate states per lattice site. The kinetic Hamiltonian is

diagonalized on this basis, and the resulting momentum-space basis is reduced by applying

a high energy cutoff W=0.4 eV to exclude high energy states that would not conform to a

i U ni, where ni is the number operator, and the full Hamiltonian H = Hk + Hd
is diagonalized. The convention of creating point defects as triangular 3-site clusters with

a perturbation strength of U/3 on each site is adopted to give 3-fold rotational symmetry

as seen experimentally [14, 15], though calculated spectra do not strongly differentiate be-

tween differently sized small site clusters (see Supplementary Fig. 6). The Hamiltonian is

numerically diagonalized, and the ARPES spectral function is defined as the energy- and

momentum-resolved spectral function of single particle annihilation, convoluted by a 10 meV

half-width Lorentzian:

This represents the spectral function for photoemission with z-axis photon polarization,

which acts with even reflection symmetry and removes electrons from the dominant pz orbital

component of the Bi2Se3−xTex surface state. Energy-momentum dispersions were found to

be rotationally isotropic, and have been rotationally averaged to obtain a small spacing

between states on the momentum axis. Figures in the paper use the rotationally averaged

9

'radial' momentum (Kr), and single-axis spectral functions can be found in Supplementary

Fig. 5. For smaller system sizes considered in Fig. 4, it was necessary to average over several

randomly generated defect configurations to achieve convergence of the twist velocity and

participation ratio. Additional modeling details are found in Supplementary Note 3.

Metrics of localization

Adding a phase twist θ at the system boundary provides an easy way to identify the degree

the momentum (K-space) basis of the Hilbert space by an offset of Kθ = θx/Lx

to which electronic states are localized. This is achieved by the standard method of shifting
ky,
where Lx (Ly) is the width of the system along the x- (y-) axis. A velocity termed the "twist
velocity" can be calculated for individual eigenstates α(cid:105) as vθ(α) = ∇KθEα (using numerical
derivatives), and represents the velocity of a persistent current. The energy- and momentum-

kx +θy/Ly

resolved twist velocity (vθ(E, k)) displayed on ARPES spectral intensity maxima in Fig. 3
is calculated via a weighted average of states within ±10meV of the energy E, as:

Here, (cid:104)k, σ represents the free particle eigenstates that have momentum k. When divided
by the width of the system L along the indicated axis, the momentum twist has units of

vθ(E, k) =

wave number. The numerical derivative is performed at a small but nonzero twist value
10 along the k direction to break degeneracies and avoid possible finite size nesting

of θ = π

effects.

The participation ratio is defined as:

energy regions at a TI surface with 100 × 100 lattice sites and 6 randomly placed point defects

(density ρ = 0.06%). One of the simulated defect resonance states has been overlaid with a 3-fold

symmetrized STM density of states image obtained 70 meV above the Dirac point of Bi2Se3. b,

The Dirac point energy (D0) and resonance state peak are labeled on the energy-resolved DOS
distribution for a large 350× 350 site surface with ρ = 0.06% defect density. Red shading indicates

states in which electrons adhere closely to defects.

Arrows indicate radial axis twist velocity vθ(E, K). The critical energy E∗, resonance energy ER
and K = 0 local maxima (D0 and D1) are labeled on panel c. d, The non-magnetic twist velocity

simulation in panel c is repeated for equivalently strong magnetic defects (J = 45 eV). e-f, The

spatial distribution of the LDOS minimum associated with the Dirac point is shown (e) from
STM measurements on Se-poor Bi2Se3−δ and (f) from a simulation for U = −45, with black dots
representing the locations of electron donating Se vacancy defects. Both distributions can be well
represented in the same ±25 meV range. g-h, The Dirac points, resonance state LDOS maximum,
and critical energy E∗ are plotted as a function of defect density and defect potential. The image in
