We describe the features of magnonic crystals based upon antiferromagnetic elements. Our main
results are that with a periodic modulation of either magnetic fields or system characteristics, such
as the anisotropy, it is possible to tailor the spin wave spectra of antiferromagnetic systems into
a band-like organization that displays a segregation of allowed and forbidden bands. The main
features of the band structure, such as bandwidths and bandgaps, can be readily manipulated. Our
results provide a natural link between two steadily growing fields of spintronics: antiferromagnetic
spintronics and magnonics.

Small deviations in the local magnetization of a mag-
netic system can propagate coherently in the form of spin
waves (SWs) whose associated quantum fields are known
as magnons. While neutral regarding its electric behav-
ior they carry a unit quantum of spin, . Due to the
lack of Joule heating associated with its transport they
stand out as promising candidates for its application in
the context of information processing[1]. The field of
solid state physics concerning the manipulation, detec-
tion and dynamics of the SWs in a magnetic system has
been dubbed magnonics[2]. The field of magnonics has
grown into a well established realm of magnetism and
opened new paths in the understanding of magnetiza-
tion dynamics of complex structures. Most of the re-
search in magnetic has focused on spin waves propagating
across systems with an overall ferromagnetic order. For
example, one of the most studied systems is Ytrium-Iron-
Garnet(YIG)[2] that, being ferrimagnetic, displays a net
magnetic moment on each unit cell. A central theme in
the field of magnonics is the implementation of magnonic
crystals (MCs), the spin wave analog of photonic and
plasmonic crystals, structures with magnetic properties
spatially modulated in a periodic fashion. In a MC the
magnon spectra is organized in the form of bands with
associated bandgaps that can be tailored by proper ad-
justment of the MC properties. A variety of magnonic de-
vices have been proposed that profit from the spin waves
as information carriers[3, 4], signal filters, phase shifters,
isolators, and signal processing elements[2].

In this work we propose to use antiferromagnets (AF)
as the basic background material in magnonics devices[5].
To highlight the potential in the use of antiferromagnetic
materials we illustrate two examples of magnonic crys-
tals that can be implemented using antiferromagnetic el-
ements. Among the main results we highlight the pos-
sibility of tailoring the magnonic bands by the use of
modulations in the magnetic field, the anisotropy of the
elements or simply by manipulating the geometry of the
system. Our results point towards an effective engineer-
ing of the magnonic bands.

Antiferromagnetic based spintronics is a rapidly de-

veloping new field by its promising and unique proper-
ties for future spintronic devices in magnetism. Despite
its lack of macroscopic magnetization, antiferromagnets,
interact with spin-polarized currents and can give rise
to spintronic effects such as magnetoresistance and spin
transfer torques[6 -- 9], the piezo-spintronic effect[10] and
skyrmion textures[11]. There are a number of advantages
that AF systems present over ferromagnetic ones regard-
ing potential applications. The lack of stray fields, rapid
frequency switching in the terahertz range and its di-
verse functionalities to be integrated with ferromagnets,
are among of the best qualities of antiferromagnets[5, 7].
The first one relates to the already mentioned lack of net
magnetization. Due to this, they do not create magnetic
fields which renders local all the interactions involved
in its manipulation. Second, the typical time-scale as-
sociated with changes in the magnetic structure is sev-
eral orders of magnitude shorter than the associated with
ferromagnetic systems [12]. This opens a possibility to
implement high-speed effects operating in the terahertz
range. Finally, antiferromagnetism is observed more of-
ten and at much softer conditions than ferromagnetism,
being found even in semiconductors at room tempera-
ture [13], this allows us to envision hybrid devices that
display features of both electronic and spintronic charac-
teristics. Among the large assortment of antiferromag-
netic materials, we have in mind those antiferromagnetic
insulators with uniaxial anisotropy such as, for exam-
ple, NiO[14], MnF2[15, 16], FeF2[17]. Spin waves in AF
have been studied since the dawn of quantum mechanics.
Both from the theoretical point of view[18] as from the
experimental[19]. There is a great deal knowledge accu-
mulated over the decades involving the spectra of spin
waves in a variety of AF. This opens a window of op-
portunity for effective control of the magnon degrees of
freedom.

We start off our discussion by stating the basic fea-
tures of our model. We study the dynamics of the
staggered magnetization field in a spatially modulated
antiferromagnet[9, 20, 21]. In terms of the microscopic
exchange energy, J, lattice constant (cid:96), coordination num-

There are two independent solutions. One has a phase
difference between n1 and n2 equal to π/2, while the
other has a phase difference equal to −π/2. These solu-
tions correspond, therefore, to spin waves circularly po-
larized to the left and to the right.
In the absence of
magnetic field both branches are degenerated. This de-
generacy is split by the magnetic field that shifts the dis-
persion relation of the right-polarized waves upward and
the dispersion relation of the left-polarized waves down-
ward by an equal amount γH. An important aspect of

FIG. 1. (a) Magnon dispersion relations for the homogenous
antiferromagnet. Without anisotropy the relation is disper-
sionless (dashed line). Addition of anisotropy raises a gap
and changes the dispersion relation to the Klein-Gordon form
(full line). In both cases the dispersion relation is doubly de-
generated reflecting the two possible polarizations of the spin
wave. (b) Addition of a homogeneous magnetic field splits
the degeneracy and creates different dispersion relations (ω(cid:9)
and ω(cid:8)) for the two opposite polarizations. (c) and (d) Il-
lustration of the two polarizations for the spin wave. The
disturbance is perpendicular to the equilibrium Neel vector

where a = 4zJS2/(cid:96)3, the homogeneous exchange energy;
A = zJS2/2(cid:96), the exchange stiffness; Kz = 2DS2/(cid:96)3 the
anisotropy (easy axis); and H = gµBB/(cid:96)3 the external
magnetic field. These parameters have spatial depen-
dencies whose specific form will be specified later on. In
F the fields are further constrained to obey n · m = 0
and n2 = 1 at every instant and everywhere within the
system. The equations of motion can be obtained from a
variation of the action where the constraints are enforced
with the aid of suitable Lagrange's multipliers. The re-
sulting dynamics is ruled by:

(1)

n = γfm × n,
m = γ (fn × n + fm × m) ,

(2)
where fm = −am + n× (H × n), fn = An× (∇2n× n) +
Kz(n · z)n × (z × n) − (n · H) m, and γ is the effective
gyromagnetic ratio.
To determine the spin waves we will consider small
variations around the Neel vector and the canting field.
Since the canting field m is itself small respect to the
local magnetic moment we linearized with respect to it.
Considering n = n0 + δn(x, t) and m = m(x, t) we ex-
pand up to first order the equations of motion (Eq. (1)
and (2)) as

δ n

(4)

the spin wave spectra that is encoded by Eqs. (3) and
(4) is that oscillations in the Neel order parameter δn
are linked to oscillations in the magnetization. In fact, a
quick look at Eqs. (3-) and (4) allows us to write:

(cid:18) 1

(cid:19)

To solve these equations let us look for monochromatic

waves in the form:

m(x, t) = (1m1 + 2m2) eik·x−iωt

(5)

(6)

in this representation we have used the constraints to ex-
press both fluctuating fields in the plane perpendicular to
n0 that is spanned by the mutually orthogonal (but oth-
erwise arbitrary) vectors 1 and 2.
In this expression
n1,2 and m1,2 are complex coefficients. Starting from
Eqs. (3-6) in a direct way we can assess the problem of
spin waves in a homogeneous antiferromagnet. The re-
sults are, naturally, consistent with the well-known dis-
persion relation[21]:

(ω ± γH)2 = aγ2(Ak2 + Kz).

(7)

This simple result is of the great importance since it
provides a way to excite and measure antiferromag-
netic spin waves by coupling them to the oscillation
in the magnetization field that they carry. This cou-
pling to the magnetic degrees of freedom has been used
for decades to characterize the spin wave spectra of
antiferromagnets[22].
In this way it is possible to use
magnetization probes, such as Faraday's and Kerr's ef-
fects or Brillouin light scattering[2], of widespread usage
in the field of magnonics, to control and study antiferro-
manetic spin waves.

Now we are ready to present the main result of the
work, the study of different ways in which these anti-
ferromagnetic spin waves can be manipulated with the

We will see how this manipulation gives rise to magnonic
bands that can be tailored with precision. There are
basically two essentially different ways to control the an-
tiferromagnetic spin waves. Starting from Eqs. (1) and
(2) we note the possibilities of modulating the system
parameters (exchange constants, anisotropy, etc) or the
magnetic field. Both parameters can be modulated to
generate magnonic crystals and in what follows we will
study the peculiarities of each particular modulation.

Eliminating m from the equations of motion we are led

to the following wave equation:

arranged with period a. Magnons that propagate along
direction transverse to the slabs experience a periodic
modulation of the anisotropy parameter thereby giving
rise to magnonic bands. This situation can be modeled
by the equation

δ n = ∇2δn − κ(y)δn.

δ n = ∇2δn − κ δn + 2h δ n × n0 + h2δn,
(cid:112)

Kzaγ2 as the unit of time
where we have set τ = 1/
and λ =
A/Kz, the domain wall width, as the unit of
length. In the last equation κ and h, the dimensionless
anisotropy coefficient and h and dimensionless magnetic
field (h = γτ (n0 · H)) respectively, are regarded as pe-
riodically modulated. For common antiferromagnets[15 -- 
17, 23] the value of τ and λ lie in the range of picoseconds
and a few nanometers respectively.

The solutions to the wave equation under a periodic
modulation can be expressed in the form of Bloch wave
functions δn(x, t) = eik·x−ωt(1n1(x) + 1n2(x)) where
n1(x) and n2(x) are periodic functions with the same
period as the spatial modulation. The equation of mo-
tion, within the Bloch's representation, unfolds into two
coupled equations for n1(x) and n2(x) that can only be
fulfilled by choosing a ±π/2 phase-shift between them.
The waves are, therefore, circularly polarized as in the
homogeneous case. Due to the magnetic field there is a
splitting between the two circular polarizations. For right
polarized waves we have δ n× n0 = ωδn while for left po-
larized waves we have δ n × n0 = −ωδn. The equation of
motion becomes:

− ω2δn = ∇2δn − κδn ± 2ω hδn + h2 δn

(9)

where the ± sign is fixed by the polarization of the spin
wave. This equation, with κ and h regarded as periodic
functions of space, is the main tool to describe a magnon
crystal within an antiferromagnet. Let us give two ex-
amples of antiferromagnetic magnonic crystals that use
this equation as the starting point.

We begin our discussion by considering the problem
in absence of magnetic field. We will focus on an one-
dimensional array with spatially modulated anisotropy
as illustrated in Fig. (2). When modulating the spatial
anisotropy one can expect that the exchange parameters,
a and A, should also be modified. Our theory is capable
to handle those modulations in a straightforward man-
ner. However, to avoid clumping our discussion with far
too many parameters we will focus in a model problem
where only the anisotropy is modulated. We have, then,
a series of slabs of width b with different anisotropies are

erostructure with changing anisotropy, illustrating the geo-
metric features. (b) Simple effective potential that represents
the effect of the modulated anisotropy. With the choice of
units given in the text, the potential is characterized by a ref-
erence anisotropy equal to unity and deviations from it equal
to δκ.
(c) Left: Magnonic dispersion relation for a = 1.0,
b = 0.5 and δκ = 10. Bands are doubly degenerated in ac-
count for the different polarizations. Bands of forbidden fre-
quencies are highlighted. Right: Same situation under the
action of a uniform magnetic field h = 0.3. The degeneracy
between the different polarization states is broken. (d) Some
features of the band structure are displayed as a function of
b/a. Top: Bandwidth of the first bands is displayed for dif-
ferent values of the crystal, full lines correspond to a = 1 and
dashed lines to a = 2. The black and blue lines correspond
to δκ = −0.5 and δκ = 3.0 respectively. Bottom: With the
same parameters we display the bandgap between the first
and second bands.

This equation shows complete degeneracy for the dif-
ferent polarizations. Searching for plane waves along the
x direction, with wave number kx, we find:

dy2 δn± + κ(y)δn±.

In the physical problem at hand the anisotropy is mod-
ulated in a piece-wise constant fashion. The background
anisotropy of the system is chosen as the basis for the

ab(a)ab 1y(b)���������������������������������������������������������������������b/awg(d)(c)-π��π����������-π��π����������!kkdimensionless anisotropy κ. There are slabs of width b
distributed uniformly with period a. Within these slabs
the anisotropy is 1 + δκ. This solution is equivalent to
a Schrodinger equation with periodic piece-wise constant
potential and its solutions can be found in textbooks[24].
In Fig. (2) we present the results for a variety of sys-
tem parameters. A glance at Fig. (2) allows us to state
the main results that are (a) double degenerated band
structure in account for different polarizations; (b) the
appearance of forbidden energies bands; and, (c) the ap-
pearance of bands of allowed energies with characteristic
bandwidths. As shown in the Fig. (2d) those features
can be controlled by an appropriate selection of the pa-
rameters of the magnonic crystal. The band structure
can be further controlled by exposing the system to the
effects of a magnetic field that results in a splitting of the
degeneracy of the bands. This is shown in Fig. (2c).

We now consider a magnonic crystal mediated by mag-
netic field. In this system a two dimensional antiferro-

a = 1 , κ = 1 and h = 0.5. Right: Band structure for

magnet is exposed to a periodically modulated external
magnetic field. While the details of the generation of
this magnetic field are irrelevant for the conclusions we
are going to draw, we can picture the following arrange-
ment: locate the antiferromagnetic system underneath a
periodic array of wires as depicted in Fig.
(3a). The
situation that we propose consists on having a current

4

propagating across the wires. The magnitude of the cur-
rent across each wire is constant while the direction of the
current is changed between consecutive wires. In this way
the Oersted field generated by the array of wires acts on
the antiferromagnet in the form of a spatially periodic
magnetic field that enters into the wave equation (Eqs.
(3-4)). To fix ideas on the nature of this equation we
approximate the field by a piece-wise constant behavior
with values ±h. Assuming a plane wave behavior along
the x-direction we find:

(ω2 − k2

x + κ + h2)δn± = −

d2
dy2 δn± ± 2hωδn±

This problem is solved following the standard procedure
described in [24], in the same way as our previous discus-
sion. The main results are displayed in Fig. (3). The pe-
riodic magnetic field gives rise to a band structure with
characteristic bandgaps and bandwidths that are char-
acterized in Fig. (3d). As we increase the strength of
the magnetic field, the lowest point in the first band de-
creases continuously from the value at zero field. This
trend leads to an instability at h = √κ when the lowest
band touches the bottom of the axis. For fields greater
than this critical value the ground state is distorted in
what is known as the spin-flop transition[16, 22].

We have discussed the possibility of

implementing
magnonic crystals in the context of antiferromagnetic
spintronics. We proposed two complementary methods
to achieve control over the magnonic degrees of free-
dom: first by controlling the anisotropy properties of the
magnon system and second by exposing the antiferro-
magnet to a periodically modulated magnetic field.
In
both cases we discussed quantitatively the properties of
the resulting magnon spectra and showed how it led to a
band-like structure of allowed and forbidden bands whose
quantitative features can be tailored by proper adjust-
ment of the parameters of the magnon crystal. This pro-
posal bridges together the two rapidly developing fields
of magnonics and antiferromagnetic spintronic.
