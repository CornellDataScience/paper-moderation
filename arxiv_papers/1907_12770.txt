Topological insulators are bulk insulators with exotic surface states, protected under time-reversal
symmetry, that hold promise in observing many exciting condensed-matter phenomena.
In this
report, we show that by having a topological insulator (Bi2Se3) in proximity to a magnetic insulator
(EuS), a metal-to-insulator transition in the surface state, attributed to opening of an exchange gap,
can be observed whose properties are tunable using bottom gate voltage and external magnetic field.
Our study provides evidence of gate-controlled enhanced interface magnetism with the signature of
half-integer quantum Hall effect when the Fermi level is tuned into the exchange gap. These results
pave the way for using magnetic proximity effect in developing topological electronic devices.

The process of breaking time reversal symmetry, by
introducing out-of-plane magnetism, at the surface of a
3-dimensional (3-D) topological insulator (TI) [1, 2] is
known to open up an exchange gap (EG) at the Dirac
point of the topologically protected surface states (TSS)
[3]. Such a mechanism support several new quantum phe-
nomena, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE)
[4, 5], half-integer quantum Hall effect (H-IQHE) [1, 6],
topological magneto-electric effect [7, 8], and image mag-
netic monopoles [9]. In realizing these effects, the main
challenge is to successfully demonstrate an opening of
gap at the surface of TI. Currently, this is made possible
in magnetic TIs such as in Cr and V-doped compensated
TIs, where perpendicular magnetism is developed in the
bulk showing QAHE [5, 10].
In comparison, inducing
local magnetism at TI surface through the short range
nature of magnetic proximity effect (MPE) can provide
a number of advantages over bulk-doping [3, 5, 11]; these
include lower bulk and surface defect density due to im-
proved film crystallinity, better controllability of the sur-
face states (SSs) and independently controlling the mag-
netic state at each surface of TI to build switchable topo-
logical devices [12].

Conventionally, MPE can be achieved by using mag-
netic insulators (MIs). However, requirement of an out-
of-plane magnetization at the TI surface makes this study
difficult since most of the MIs naturally possess in-plane
anisotropy. Additionally, new hybridization states [13]
that may form at the TI/MI interface near the Fermi
level (EF ) can contaminate the topological properties of
the Dirac SSs [14 -- 16]. As a result, observing these effects
through transport studies can become non-trivial.
In
this regard, MPE studies in the 3D TI, Bismuth Selenide
(Bi2Se3), with an MI, Europium sulphide (EuS), is exten-
sively researched [17 -- 19]. Different research groups con-
firm the presence of an out-of-plane component of magne-
tization at the Bi2Se3/EuS interface with the magnetism
existing at temperature much above the magnetic transi-

tion temperature (Tc) of EuS (∼ 17K). Our magnetome-
try studies on Bi2Se3(10nm)/EuS(1nm) also confirm the
existence of enhanced interface magnetism with a second
transition close to 232K (refer to Fig. S8). Here, the
strong spin-orbit contribution of the Bi2Se3 surface is re-
ported to give rise to an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy
in the interface EuS layer [18, 20]. Unlike other TI/MI
interfaces [14, 15, 21, 22], recent theoretical calculation
of the above interface also suggest induced magnetism,
localized within the first quintuple layer (QL) of Bi2Se3
[23], with the SS retaining most of the topological char-
acter compared to a pristine Bi2Se3 SSs [20]. Further, an
induced EG of ∼ 9 meV in the surface Dirac cone is sug-
gested [23]. Despite these reports, experimental observa-
tion of the EG opening at this surface has been elusive
[24]. This is primarily due to inherent intrinsic doping
caused by large Se vacancies leading to bulk dominated
conduction with EF pinning deep inside the conduction
band (CB). In this letter, using gate controlled trans-
port studies, we provide evidence of gaining access to
the exchange gapped TSSs at the Bi2Se3/EuS interface
showing signature of H-IQHE (Fig.1a) and observe a gate
and magnetic-field controlled interface magnetism affect-
ing the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) response.

Thin films of Bi2Se3 were grown on amorphous SiO2
(a-SiO2) substrate at 250◦C in our molecular beam epi-
taxy system with a base pressure of 8× 10−10 mbar using
a co-evaporation technique. The film's structural proper-
ties were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray
diffraction and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
(see Fig. S1 in Suppl. Mater.).
Interestingly, cross-
sectional TEM images reveal a layered growth, support-
ing the hexagonal structure with 0.95 nm thickness of
the QL (inset of Fig.1b), as also observed in the work
of Bansal et. al.
[25]. For transport measurements,
thicker Bi2Se3 films in 10 to 16 nm range were grown.
Subsequently, a 3 nm film of EuS was deposited in a
sulphur-rich environment at room temperature, without
breaking vacuum, followed by a 2 nm-capping layer of
AlOx(x∼1.3-1.5). Hall bar structures with length, L and
width, W were patterned by mechanical etching (Fig. 1a,
also see Fig. S2). Compared to the Hall mobility (µ) of

FIG. 1. (a) Schematic of our TI/MI Hall bar devices (left) with bottom gate electrode. Chemical potential dependency of
Hall resistivity (ρxy) in B=0 (red) and B(cid:54)=0 (blue) demonstrating H-IQHE is shown. Three different positions (1,2 and 3) of
surface EF , modulated by Vg, is labelled in the exchange gapped SSs of TI. For B=0, When EF lies in the EG (position 2),
half-integer quantized value of ρxy is expected which vanish when EF moves out of the EG (position 1 and 3). At B=0, 1D
chiral Fermion edge states appear along magnetic domain walls which vanish in external magnetic field due to alignment of
domains. (b) Normalized longitudinal resistivity (ρxx) vs T of 12 nm Bi2Se3 films capped by 2 nm-AlOx (red circles), 2 nm-Se
(black square) and 3 nm-EuS (blue triangle). Inset shows cross-sectional TEM image of sample: Si/SiO2/Bi2Se3(5.5 nm). (c)
Thickness dependence of normalize ρxx vs T for the Se capped (hollow symbols) and EuS capped device (solid symbols) with
12nm (triangles) and 16nm (circles) thickness of Bi2Se3. Corresponding temperature value of the resistivity up-turn is also
indicated. Temperature dependence of (d) µ and (e) nHall for Bi2Se3(16nm)/Se and Bi2Se3(16nm)/EuS devices.

epitaxial films of similar thickness grown on c-cut sap-
phire substrate (∼1000 cm2/V·s for 16 nm), mobility of
films on a-SiO2 substrates were found to be lower (∼450
cm2/V·s). This relatively lower bulk mobility of films on
a-SiO2 substrate may be beneficial in detecting a larger
contribution of the robust SSs, unaffected by defects, over
bulk conduction.

Figure 1b shows the temperature dependence of lon-
gitudinal resistivity (ρxx) for 12 nm Bi2Se3 films with
three different capping layers viz. 2 nm AlOx, 2 nm Se
and 3 nm EuS. All the three devices show a predomi-
nant metallic signature during cool down, but respond
differently at lower temperatures (< 30K). Films with
AlOx capping layer show a weak upturn in ρxx at ∼28K
followed by a metallic signature at lower temperatures
(<19K). On the other hand, Bi2Se3 films with Se and
EuS capping layer show an upward trend in ρxx below
19K, with a stronger response in the latter. The above
observation of capping layer dependent variations in the
temperature dependence of ρxx, primarily in a narrow
thickness window of ∼12 to 16 nm of our Bi2Se3 films,
does suggest combination of bulk impurity band freez-
ing [26] and complex interface processes such as charge
transfer across the interface due to work function mis-
match/chemical reactivity and charge transfer between
the TSSs and bulk states, all of them to be playing a
role in the device response (see section 3 & 4 of Suppl.

Mater.). In the case of TIs, position of EF at the sur-
face can greatly depend on the relative concentration of
bulk and surface defect density [27, 28]. A large mis-
match in the surface and bulk EF can lead to charge
transfer and bending of bulk bands near the surface, re-
sulting in a depleted (an accumulated) surface region in
films with lower (higher) surface defect density (see sec-
tion 4 of Suppl. Mater.). Importantly, the decrease in
ρxx in AlOx capped films below ∼19K does suggest that
apart from the insulating-like response due to impurity
band freezing at ∼28K, interface band bending leading
to accumulation is also playing a contributory role to the
overall device resistance (see Fig S5).

To investigate the upturn in film's ρxx for the Se and
EuS capped films, thickness dependence of ρxx vs T plot
is shown in figure 1c. Hall mobility of these devices in-
crease with cool down and finally saturate (Fig. 1d),
suggesting a dominant band-transport conduction (see
section 3 of Suppl. Mater.).
In the case of Se capped
films, the upturn in ρxx occur at ∼18K for 12 nm films
and decrease to ∼15K for 16 nm films which we attribute
primarily due to impurity band freezing. In the case of
films of similar thickness and mobility, capped wih EuS,
a stronger upturn in ρxx occur at a temperature of 19K,
that remain unchanged in both the 12 nm and 16 nm
Bi2Se3/EuS devices. These observations suggest the ori-
gin of this upturn to a more dominant interface effect

supporting an MIT response. Further, the decrease in
ρxx of the EuS capped devices with cool down is rel-
atively gradual than the Se capped devices (Fig. 1c), a
trend observed in different samples with different W (200
µm to 2 mm). This response is primarily caused by de-
pletion of charge carriers, noted by the relatively lower
Hall carrier density (nHall, Fig. 1e), that suggest contri-
butions from the upward band bending (depletion region)
near the Bi2Se3/EuS interface with the possible lowering
of interface EF below the conduction band edge.
It is
experimentally known that the surface of Bi2Se3 can be
chemically reactive that can cause strong band-bending
effects at the surface [29, 30]. Density functional the-
ory (DFT) studies reveal that Eu-Se bond formation at
the Bi2Se3/EuS interface is more favorable [23] and hence
may cause lower surface defect density supporting an up-
ward band bending. Further studies may be needed to
microscopically probe these interface chemical responses.
Additionally, we also explored the effect of above insu-
lating transition on the topological properties of Bi2Se3
SSs using weak antilocalization (WAL) studies [27, 31]
at low temperatures (< 30K, Fig. S7). Our analysis
using the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) formalism [32]
reveal a drop in WAL channel by a value of ∼1 in the
Bi2Se3/EuS devices compared to the Bi2Se3/Se devices
(showing a value close to 2). This finding corroborates
well with the possibility of MPE opening up an EG in the
top SS, with only the bottom surface channel dominantly
contribute to the WAL response.

In an effort to tune EF within the bandgap to ac-
cess the exchange gapped TSSs, the devices were inves-
tigated using back gate voltage (Vg) studies. Here, the
high bulk carrier density (> 1019/cm3) prevent the move-
ment of bulk EF towards the Dirac point and is expected
to only modulate the band bending near the depleted
Bi2Se3/EuS interface. Figure 2a shows the temperature
dependence of longitudinal resistance (Rxx) vs Vg of the
Bi2Se3/EuS devices. Here, a hysteresis response in Rxx
is observed at all temperatures below 125K, with simi-
lar response observed in 4 different sets of samples and
with different film thickness (Fig. S10).
In compari-
son, the Se capped devices show no such behavior (Fig.
S9). Our analysis suggest that the hysteresis in Rxx arise
due to weaker gating, with the interface EF pinning/de-
pinning within the band gap of Bi2Se3 (primarily at the
band edge). The fact that the onset of hysteresis occurs
around the same temperature when the carrier density
falls down (T < 100K, Fig. 1e) corroborates well with
the mechanism related to band bending and the EF at
the interface dropping into the band gap. In figure 2a,
at temperatures below 25K, a second smaller hysteresis
response is noted, extending to positive gate voltage (re-
fer to Fig. S10). We attribute the origin of the second
hysteresis to the opening of EG by EuS and the associ-
ated EF pinning/de-pinning within the EG. In figure 2b,
we show Rxx and Hall resistance (Rxy) vs Vg of the de-
vice measured at 1.5K. Rxy, measured in zero magnetic
field, also shows a hysteresis response with the value ris-

measured at different T s. A second hysteresis response appear
in positive Vg at and below 25K (refer to Fig. S6). The plots
are shifted vertically for clarity.
(b) Rxx (triangles, left y-
axis) and Rxy (circle and square, right y-axis) vs Vg for the
above device at 1.5K. Red circle is measured at 0 Oe and blue
square is taken in a perpendicular field of 100 Oe. The solid
arrow heads denote the direction of sweep in Vg. Position of
the EF corresponding to the high and low value of Rxy (for 0
Oe data) is schematically shown.

ing above Vg ∼15V in the positive sweep cycle reach-
ing ∼70mΩ and dropping down at -27V in the negative
sweep cycle of Vg. We associate the high resistance state
of Rxy to the condition of EF lying in the EG of the SSs
showing signature of H-IQHE (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, as
expected, the H-IQHE disappear in presence of a small
perpendicular magnetic field of 100 Oe that aligns the do-
mains in the EuS, without an appreciable change in Rxx.
These observations further validate the existence of per-
pendicularly aligned magnetic domains that support dis-
sipationless chiral edge states at the domain walls. Here,
the existence of bulk conduction channel, multi-domain
structure and bottom Dirac SS are limiting the observa-
tion of half-integer value of quantised Hall conductance.
We next probe the effect of Vg on the MIT response,
due to opening of EG, in our Bi2Se3/EuS devices. Fig-
ure 3 shows the measurements of Rxx vs T, performed
at different Vgs. At negative Vg, the insulating transition
was observed at temperature, TM IT ∼ 19K, which is en-
hanced to ∼ 32K at positive Vg with an corresponding in-
crease in the carrier density (top inset of Fig.3). In com-
parison, the Se capped devices showed no such response
(see Fig. S9). Such an increase in TM IT at positive
Vg, which also makes the device conducting (seen by the
downward shift of plots), at first seems counter-intuitive.
However, this observation is suggestive of conduction-
electron-mediated ferromagnetic exchange between the

Eu atoms strengthening the interface magnetism, with an
enhancement in Tc of the EuS 'interface layer'. In EuS,
magnetism arises due to the overlap of the Eu 4f orbitals
with the valence band below the EF leading to a weaker
exchange coupling [33]. DFT studies by Kim et. al. [20]
have shown that the TSSs that weakly interconnect the
conduction and valance bands can mediate exchange cou-
pling between Eu atoms through the Ruderman-Kittel-
Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) type interactions [34 -- 36], with
the exchange constant being sensitive to the position of
EF near the Dirac point. The observed gate controlled
tuning of TM IT in our devices does provide evidence of
such an indirect exchange mechanism at the Bi2Se3/EuS
interface. This enhanced interface magnetism can hence
open up a larger EG and may be responsible for the
larger increase in resistance under positive Vg, peaking
at Vg ∼ 50V (bottom-right inset of Fig.3). A higher
value of TM IT ∼ 19K i.e. 2K above the bulk Tc of EuS
is observed even at high negative Vg (depleted interface)
which may indicate the role of high spin-orbit strength of
the Bi2Se3 surface states leading to an enhancement in
the Tc of the bulk EuS film. For Vg > 15V, the resistance
plots show a point of inflection at 19K, below which, the
resistance increases further. This feature may therefore
correspond to the magnetic transition of EuS layers away
from the interface, unaffected by the above carrier me-
diated indirect exchange interactions. Comparing with
the warm up data of Rxx vs T (Fig. S11), our analy-
sis support the existence of difference in the transition
temperature of bulk and interface EuS layer.

Apart from the enhancement in TM IT for Vg > 15V,
we also observe a very prominent and reproducible drop
(observed in different devices) in the device resistance
preceding MIT. This sudden drop in resistance, by al-
most 10 Ω (for the plot of Vg=50V), may be suggestive
of formation of 1D chiral fermion edge states [1] along the
magnetic domain walls at the interface around Tc (Fig.
1a), with the simultaneous opening of EG. With the low-
ering of temperature, domains become larger leading to a
dominant insulating transport response due to EG open-
ing. Comparing with the Rxy vs Vg data of figure 2b
(in the positive sweep cycle), the observation of the re-
sistance drop for Vg > 15V in figure 3 corroborates well
with the position of EF within the EG to start observing
the H-IQHE signal and to access these chiral edge states
in our devices.

To further investigate these responses, the devices
were cooled down in different perpendicular magnetic
fields (HF C), keeping Vg at 50V, as shown in figure 4.
Firstly, we observe a decrease in TM IT with the increas-
ing strength of HF C (inset of Fig.4). This may be sug-
gestive of weakening of the antiferromagnetic exchange
between the conduction electrons and the Eu 4f atoms,
observed in such indirect exchange interactions. Also
notably, when cooled in higher magnetic fields, the re-
sistance drop preceding TM IT starts to vanish in these
devices. This occurs because the domain with parallel
magnetization grows at the onset of magnetism, result-

(circle). Left inset shows schematic of CB bending (solid lines)
at the top Bi2Se3 surface for large positive Vg (bottom) and
large negative Vg (top). Enhanced interface magnetism, at-
tributed to indirect exchange at positive Vgs, can also lead to
increased EG suggested by large ∆R = R(1.5K) − R(TM IT )
peaking at Vg = 50V (bottom right inset).

ing of the indirect exchange at the interface.

ing in the reduction of domain wall that support these
conducting 1D edge states. These observations of the
dip in resistance before MIT, which we attribute to the
formation of conducting 1D edge states at the domain
walls, also highlight that the interface-gapped states in
our devices do carry topological properties, and the MIT

response of our devices is not due to the formation of
any trivial hybridization gap [16, 37]. Together with the
evidence of H-IQHE signal, our results therefore demon-
strate the capability to use MPE to engineer new classes
of topological electronic devices.
