From the scattering of semicoherent-state wave packets at high magnetic field, we derive analyt-
ically the transmission coefficient of electrons in graphene in the quantum Hall regime through a
smooth constriction described by a quadratic saddle-point electrostatic potential. We find anoma-
lous half-quantized conductance steps that are rounded by a backscattering amplitude related to
the curvature of the potential. Furthermore, the conductance in graphene breaks particle-hole sym-
metry in cases where the saddle-point potential is itself asymmetric in space. These results have
implications both for the interpretation of split-gate transport experiments, and for the derivation
of quantum percolation models for graphene.

The quantum point-contact geometry formed by
metallic split gates in the quantum Hall regime is a
cornerstone of many experiments in two-dimensional
electron gases (2DEGs) based on semiconducting het-
erostructures. For example, in recent interferometry ex-
periments made with electrons, the quantum point con-
tact plays the role of an electronic beam splitter.1 At the
theoretical side, the consideration of a smooth constric-
tion represents a simple toy model of elaborated quan-
tum transport theories. For instance, the transmission
coefficient through a saddle-point potential2 is a central
piece of the percolation network models,3,4 which have
been introduced to describe the inter-plateaus dissipa-
tive transport in the quantum Hall effect.

Smooth constrictions are usually modeled by the local

potential profile at the bottleneck of the constriction

V (r) = by2 − ax2,

(1)

where a and b are real positive coefficients characterizing
the potential (for convenience, we chose the electrostatic
potential value at the saddle as the origin for the en-
ergies).
Important insights on the tunneling processes
determining the transport properties through quantum
point contacts can be gained from the quantum me-
chanical motion of the electron in such a simple po-
tential as given by Eq.
In the standard 2DEGs
usually described by Schrodinger's equation, the energy
dependence of the transmission coefficient through the
quadratic potential in Eq. (1) is well-known and given
under high magnetic fields (i.e., neglecting Landau-level
mixing while keeping the magnetic length lB finite) by
the expression5

(1).

for the nth Landau level, where lB = pc/(eB) is the
magnetic length, ωc is the Landau-level spacing in the
2DEG, and ζ = l2
B(b − a). Tunneling processes give rise
to a nonzero probability for the electron at energy E < 0
to be transmitted on the other side of the constriction
while an electron at E > 0 goes weakly backscattered
through the available channels.

With monolayer graphene consisting of carbon atoms
packed in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice appears
a new host material,6 where electrons are confined to
two dimensions, yet with some exotic properties. The
observation of an anomalous quantum Hall effect in
graphene7,8 understood in terms of a relativisticlike spec-
low-energy electrons9 has been followed by
trum of
numerous experimental and theoretical contributions10
aiming at exhibiting specific signatures of the 2D mass-
less Dirac fermions in a non-uniform potential. The stud-
ies of simple analytical problems, such as the quantum-
mechanical motion of massless particles in the quadratic
saddle-point potential [(1)], are of valuable interest for
identifying such unusual properties. However, it turns
out that quadratic potentials, which are exactly solvable
in ordinary 2DEGs at any magnetic field, become gener-
ally not analytically solvable within the Dirac equation.
Here, we consider the regime of large magnetic fields,
in which the Landau level spacing in graphene is large
enough so that one can work in the single Landau-level
limit. We have recently shown11 using a semicoherent-
state Green's-function formalism that quadratic prob-
lems then become soluble in this regime.

The determination of the transmission coefficient
through a smooth constriction for graphene in the high
magnetic field limit [i.e., the counterpart of Eq. (2)] is the
main result of this Rapid Communication, that we start
by discussing in relation to conductance quantization in

graphene, with a detailed derivation using semicoherent-
state Green's functions making the rest of the Rapid
Communication. The exact transmission coefficient for
graphene in the absence of Landau-level mixing reads in
the nth Landau level (with n ≥ 1)

where ǫ = ±1 is a band index characterizing the electron
and hole-like contributions, and

with Ωc = √2vF /lB (vF is the graphene Fermi velocity).
The transmission probability for the lowest Landau level
(n = 0) is given by T0(E) = 1/2.

tial µ is given in terms of the transmission probabilities

where we have accounted for the spin and valley degen-
eracies in graphene with the overall prefactor 4.

Then, as found in Ref. 12 for the 2DEG case, the
conductance quantization in the graphene case shown in
Fig. 1 directly follows from the transmission probabil-
ities. The first obvious observation is the half-integer
quantization of the conductance in terms of the con-
ductance quantum (here 4e2/h) with plateaus at values
(n + 1/2)4e2/h, reminiscent of the half-integer quantiza-
tion of the Hall conductance. Two different configura-
tions, symmetric and asymmetric with respect to π/2 ro-
tation of the saddle-point potential in Eq. (1), have been
considered, which yield to two different curves. A sym-
metric saddle-point potential is characterized by a = b,
thus ζ = 0, and the conductance shows clear particle-hole
symmetry with respect to change in the energy sign. In
the case of an asymmetric saddle-point potential (a 6= b),
ζ becomes non-zero, signaling a breaking of particle-hole
symmetry in the energy levels Eq.
(4), and resulting
in a non-uniform shift of the conductance steps, which
is more pronounced for the highest Landau levels.
It
is worth noting that the asymmetry of the potential in
Eq. (1) has a different consequence in the case of the
standard 2DEG, where it just leads to a redefinition of
the Landau-level spacing, see Eq. (2), and such a small
quantitative modification appears difficult to perceive in
an experiment. In graphene, the effect of the potential
asymmetry should be more easily seen in experiments,
since it yields an asymmetry between the positive- and
negative- energy dependences of the conductance.

Now, we focus on the derivation of Eq. (3). We con-
sider a single-particle Hamiltonian model for an electron
of charge e = −e and of Fermi velocity vF confined to

both physical spin and valley indices, thus assuming that
the two valleys of graphene remain completely decoupled
form each other and can be studied separately. In addi-
tion, we shall not consider the effects of ripples or a mass
potential but these could be studied following Ref. 11.

ity amplitude for a vortex with circulation (or Landau-

position R1 at time t1 to be at point R2 at time t2 with
a new circulation n2 and a band index λ2.
In the fol-
lowing, we consider the dynamics projected onto a single
Landau level, meaning that the vortex circulation is con-
served (n1 = n2 = n). Formally, this corresponds to
taking the limit vF → +∞. Within a single Landau level
n, the retarded Green's function takes the form11

In the absence
of Landau-level mixing and for a quadratic saddle-point
electrostatic potential with the spatial dependence given
by Eq. (1), the function g can be calculated exactly11

We note from Eq. (16) that for n ≥ 1 and ζ 6= 0 the
function hn;λ1;λ2 (t) is not diagonal in the λ space, indicat-
ing that λ is generically no more a good quantum number
in the presence of asymmetric saddle-point potentials. A
straightforward diagonalization shows that ǫ = ± ap-
pears instead as a good number, with hn;ǫ(t) = e−itEn,ǫ.
According to the above formula (4) for En,ǫ, the quantum
number ǫ clearly labels the electron-like and hole-like en-
ergy bands. We shall henceforth represent the Green's
function in this ǫ representation, where the latter takes
a diagonal form.

In order to determine the transmission coefficient with
a given energy channel (i.e., at Landau-level index n
and band index ǫ fixed), we only need the Green's func-
tion Gn;ǫ(R1, R2) when the states at vortex positions R1
and R2 correspond to the same energy and are asymp-
totically far from the saddle point located at the ori-
gin. For a saddle-point potential of the form (1), this
means taking the limits X1 → ∞ and X2 → ∞,
while V (X1, Y1) = V (X2, Y2) = const. Making the
change in variable s = d(cid:2)1 − γτ 2(t)(cid:3) /(cid:2)1 + γτ 2(t)(cid:3),
where d = X1Y2 − X2Y1/l2
B, we can easily take the
limit d → +∞ in the integral in Eq. (19), and obtain the

of the saddle-point potential V (R), i.e., Y1 ∼ X1pa/b
and Y2 ∼ −X2pa/b. The two modes ǫ = ± circulate in

the same direction, and are not mixed since they are well
separated in energy.

Within the present saddle-point geometry, the trans-
mission coefficient can be extracted from the asymptotic
form of the retarded vortex Green's function, thus per-
forming scattering theory in terms of coherent-state wave
packets instead of the more standard plane waves. In the
conduction band (ǫ = +), the transmission of a vortex
from the left half-plane to the right half-plane is described
by Green's function expression [Eq. (20)] with the sign
function σ = − while the vortex reflection, where the
vortex remains in the left half-plane, is characterized by
σ = + (see Fig. 2). Therefore, the ratio of the trans-
mission amplitude to the reflection amplitude for a given
Landau level n in the conduction band is given by the
ratio of these two Green's functions:

The relations between the transmission probabilities Tn,ǫ
and the transmission and reflection amplitudes,
i.e.,

Eq. (3).
For the peculiar case of the lowest Landau level,
contributions both from the original conduction and
valence bands arise. We get for the electron-like excita-

In conclusion, we have calculated the transmission co-
efficient for a quadratic saddle-point electrostatic po-
tential in graphene, and found that shape asymmetries
generic to quantum point contacts break particle-hole
symmetry in the conductance. Our results should be
relevant for future split gate experiments in graphene as
well as for the formulation of quantum network models.
Theoretically, we have also presented an alternative way
of deriving transmission coefficients from the scattering
of coherent-state wave packets.

5 This result for the 2DEG can be derived from Eqs. (1.2)-
(1.6) of Ref. 2 in the limit ωc → ∞ by neglecting the
Landau-level mixing correction to the curvature energy E1.
Such corrections lead to additional yet small contributions
to the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient in
the large cyclotron frequency limit, without affecting its
qualitative behavior.
