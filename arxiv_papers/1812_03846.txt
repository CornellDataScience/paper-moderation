In a vicinity of the Fermi surface, graphene layers with bandgaps allow for closely simulating the
vacuum of quantum electrodynamics and, thus, its yet unverified strong-field phenomenology with
accessible field strengths. This striking feature is exploited to investigate a plausible materialization
of dynamically assisted pair production through the analog production of light but massive pairs
of Dirac quasiparticles. The process is considered in a field configuration combining a weak high-
frequency electric mode and a strong low-frequency electric field oscillating in time. Its theoretical
study is carried out from a quantum kinetic approach, similar to the one governing the spontaneous
production of pairs in QED. We show that the presence of the weak assisting mode can strongly
increase the number of produced massive Dirac pairs as compared with a setup driven by the strong
field only. The efficiency of the process is contrasted, moreover, with the case of gapless graphene
to highlight the role played by the quasiparticle mass.

INTRODUCTION

Perceiving the vacuum as a region in which quan-
tum fluctuations of all realizable fields in nature occur
has always been accompanied by the intriguing possi-
bility of their materialization into real particles at the
expense of the vacuum instability. Among field theo-
ries describing the fundamental interactions, quantum
electrodynamics (QED) provides the most accessible sce-
nario in which this phenomenon could be realized. There,
the spontaneous production of fermions is predicted to
occur in form of electron-positron pairs if an electric-
like background [E2 − B2 > 0] polarizes the quantum
vacuum.1 The simplest configuration allowing for the
pair production (PP) process  --  commonly known as the
Schwinger mechanism  --  requires just a constant electric
field [B = 0, E = const].
In such a situation, the as-
sociated PP rate R ∼ exp[−πm2c3/(eE)] manifests an
essential singularity in the coupling strength e indicating
the nonperturbative nature of this striking strong field
phenomenon [1 -- 3]. That the Schwinger mechanism has
so far eluded any detection agrees with the exponential
suppression that R undergoes, because  --  by now  --  it is
impossible to generate macroscopically extended electric
fields with amplitude E comparable to the critical scale
in QED, Ecr = m2c3/(e) ∼ 1016 V/cm.

Due to continuous progress toward high-power lasers
facilities, the possibility of observing the (dynamical)

Schwinger mechanism in tightly focused pulses is cur-
rently receiving considerable attention. Envisaged multi-
petawatt facilities such as the Extreme Light Infrastruc-
ture (ELI) [4] and the Exawatt Center for Extreme Light
Studies (XCELS) [5] are expected to achieve peak field
strengths of the order of ∼ 10−2Ecr, which will bring the
PP process closer to experimental accessibility. Moti-
vated by these prospects, theoreticians have studied spe-
cial configurations of laser fields that might help to at-
tain a detectable PP signal (see Refs. [6, 7] and references
therein). In particular, various proposals have been put
forward to mitigate the exponential suppression of the
Schwinger pair creation rate [8 -- 17]. Indeed, compelling
theoretical evidences indicate a significant enhancement
of the PP rate R ∼ exp[−κEcr/E] with 0 < κ (cid:28) 1,
when the strong field configuration is assisted by a fast-
oscillating laser beam of weaker intensity.2 In a physi-
cally intuitive picture, this enhancement in R is caused
by the absorption of a photon from the fast-oscillating
field, this way reducing effectively the width of the barrier
that an electron has to tunnel from negative to positive
Dirac continuum.

Although promising, this so-called dynamically as-
sisted Schwinger mechanism still awaits a proof-of-
principle test, and even with the envisaged fields in opera-
tion, it is likely that its experimental verification remains
a very challenging task. A complementary route for prob-
ing the vacuum instability assisted by an additional fast-
oscillating wave is to look for a QED-like vacuum in

lute charge of an electron will be denoted by c and e, respectively.
Besides,  identifies the Planck constant.

2 Similar enhancement has been predicted to occur in production
channels other than the one described so far, provided the assist-
ing high-frequency laser wave is present [18 -- 20].

which the mentioned process becomes manifest at much
lower energies and field strengths. In this sense, graphene
monolayers designed with a bandgap ∆ε (cid:46) 0.3 eV [21 -- 
24] constitute an ideal scenario. Indeed, recent measure-
ments of optical radiation emitted from regular graphene
layers [∆ε = 0] irradiated by ultrashort terahertz pulses,
provide strong evidence about the interband transition
of electrons in the field of the THz pulse. The radiation
is presumably caused by the recombinations of electron-
hole pairs created via the Schwinger mechanism [25]. See
also Refs. [26, 27].

The suitability of bandgapped  --  or semiconductor  -- 
graphene layers can be understood as a direct conse-
f ) (cid:46)
quence of the quasiparticle mass m = ∆ε/(2v 2
10 keV/c2 [with vf ≈ c/300 the Fermi velocity] and
the relativistic-like dispersion relation wppp = (ppp2v 2
f +
m 2v 4
f )1/2 that Dirac fermions exhibit when their ener-
gies are nearby the Fermi surface, i.e. close to any of
the two inequivalent Dirac points KKK± in the recipro-
cal lattice [28].
Indeed, within the nearest-neighbours
tight-binding model these two properties allow us to
closely simulate the matter sector of QED, and thus,
its quantum vacuum. Likewise, the electron-positron
PP process finds an analogous phenomenon: the field-
induced creation of quasiparticle-hole pairs from valence
to conduction band. Recently, the similarity has been
stressed further by noticing that the associated PP rate
in the vicinity of KKK± closely resembles the exponen-
tial dependence Rg ∼ exp[−πm 2v 3
f /(eE)] found for the
Schwinger mechanism [29]. The feasibility for materializ-
ing relativistic-like tunneling in semiconductors has also
been investigated in Ref. [30]. As in QED, critical field
strengths can be associated with these materials. For
instance, in graphene varieties with band gaps this one
f /(e) (cid:46) 105 V/cm is set by the exponent of
Eg = m 2v 3
Rg . However, in contrast to Ecr, the latter can be eas-
ily overpassed with present-day laser technology, without
damaging the material. This feature offers a genuine op-
portunity for a well-controllable materialization of both
the Schwinger mechanism and its dynamically assisted
version through the described solid-state analog.

Here, we investigate the production of quasiparticle-
hole pairs in an external field configuration involving
a fast-oscillating electric mode of weak intensity super-
posed on a strong, low-frequency electric field oscillating
in time. Our study is carried out from a quantum ki-
netic approach, similar to the one governing the spon-
taneous PP process in QED. Our outcomes reveal that
the number of created massive quasiparticles in this as-
sisted setup can be strongly enhanced by the presence
of the high-frequency mode.
In particular, by exploit-
ing the laser repetition rate in our bifrequent setup, the
number of pairs can become comparable to the single-
shot outcome resulting from a scenario in which the high-
frequency wave is not present and the Dirac fermions are
massless instead. The mentioned aspects are exposed in
two sections.
In Sec. II, we set the theoretical frame-
work on which our study relies. Likewise, some impor-

2

tant features of the production of electron-hole pairs in
bandgapped graphene are analyzed in connection with
transport theory. The numerical results are presented in
Sec. III, where in parallel, the role of the resonant effects
arising in the single-particle distribution function is dis-
cussed. Also the density of pairs yielded in the assisted
field configuration is shown in this section. Further com-
ments and remarks are given in the conclusions.

II. QUANTUM KINETIC APPROACH

Let us briefly precise some general features linked
to the spontaneous production of electron-hole pairs in
graphene layers. Previous studies on this phenomenon
have been carried out [31 -- 35] in connection with the
absence of a gap ∆ε = 0 that the regular synthesiza-
tion of graphene manifests [36 -- 38]. Such a characteristic
constitutes, however, a drawback when thinking of ma-
terializing the dynamically-assisted PP process via the
graphene analogue because the exponential suppression
of the corresponding rate is removed fully. As this be-
havior is essential for judging both the plausible PP en-
hancement as well as the nonperturbative character of
this phenomenon, we will suppose that the charge carri-
ers can acquire a tiny mass m = ∆ε/2v 2
f corresponding
to a gap ∆ε ∼ 0.1 eV [λ = 2π/(mvf ) ∼ 0.1 nm], which
can originate from the epitaxial growth of graphene on
SiC substrate [21, 22], for instance. We emphasize that,
in addition to this techniques, there exist a variety of
well-known forms to induce gaps in the band structure
of graphene. They include elastic strain [23] or Rashba
spin splittings on magnetic substrates [24].
From now on the external electric field EEE(t) =
−∂AAA(t)/(c∂t) [A0(t) = 0] is supposed spatially homo-
geneous but time dependent with

ω

Here Ω and Es are the respective frequency and the elec-
tric field amplitude of the strong field, whereas ω and
Ew correspond to the frequency and the field strength of
the perturbative fast-oscillating wave. The parameters
contained within the trigonometric functions are φ = Ωt
and η = ω/Ω. Besides, nnnT = (0, 1, 0) defines the polar-
ization direction of the field which we assume  --  hereafter
 --  embedded in the plane defined by the graphene sheet,
i.e. at z = 0. In Eq. (1) the envelope function is chosen
with sin2-ramping and de-ramping intervals, whereas a
plateau region of constant field intensity is taken in be-
tween:

F (φ) = sin2 (φ/2) [Θ(π − φ)Θ(φ) + Θ(2πN − φ)
× Θ(φ − 2πK )] + Θ(φ − π)Θ(2πK − φ),

(2)

where N = Nplateau + 1, K = N − 1
2 and Θ(x) denotes
the unit step function: Θ(x) = 1 at x (cid:62) 0, Θ(x) = 0
at x < 0. Here Nplateau counts for the number of cycles

within the region where F (φ) = 1. Observe that Eq. (1)
and (2) guarantee the starting of the oscillating electric
field with zero-amplitude at t = 0.

There exist various ways of generating a field of this
nature. A first option could be a head-on collision of
two pairs of linearly polarized laser pulses sharing two
frequencies, the same polarization directions and which
propagate perpendicularly to the graphene sheet. A sec-
ond option can be envisaged by combining the field gener-
ated by a capacitor with ac voltage and the one generated
by the collision of two counterpropagating monochro-
matic laser waves which, as in the previous setup, im-
pinge perpendicularly to the layer. Observe that, to
fit with our theoretical treatment, the field directions of
both time dependent electric components have to coin-
cide. The described scenarios do not provide a homoge-
neous electric field; those resulting from the wave colli-
sions depend on their direction of propagation. However,
because of the chosen geometry, no essential effect due
to the spatial inhomogeneity along the direction of prop-
agation is expected. Clearly, the field generated by the
laser waves also has a transverse finite extension char-
acterized by the waist size w0, and so it is inhomoge-
neous in the (x, y)−plane. We remark that no impact
due to this transverse focusing is expected either as long
as w0 turns out to be much larger than the length of
the graphene layer, which we take here of the order
of (cid:96) ∼ O(10) µm. Clearly, the counterpropagation of
the electric-field-generating plane-waves could take place
along the graphene sheet rather than perpendicular to it.
If this is the case, the homogeneous electric field approx-
imation requires the involved laser wavelengths λs,w to
exceed significantly the typical formation length of the
PP process lpair ∼ δ/eEs with δ = ∆ε − ω [18, 19].

From the theory prospect, quantum kinetic theory con-
stitutes an appropriate approach for investigating the
production of electron-hole pairs in graphene. In contrast
to perturbative processes in unstable vacuum -- described
by Feynman diagrams [39, 40] -- the dynamical informa-
tion of the pure PP process can be comprised in the
single-particle distribution function Wg (ppp, t) of electrons
and holes to which the degrees of freedom in the ex-
ternal field are relaxed at asymptotically large times
[t → ±∞], i.e., when the electric field is switched off
EEE(±∞) → 0. Whenever the momentum of the massive
quasiparticles ppp, relative to KKK± satisfies the condition
ppp (cid:28) KKK± = 4π
√
with a0 = 0.142 nm [23], the time

evolution of this quantity is dictated by a quantum ki-
netic equation [29]:3

Here, the vacuum initial condition Wg (ppp,−∞) = 0 is as-
sumed. This formula is characterized by the function

f of a Dirac quasiparticle. As no depen-
dence on temperature is manifested in Eq. (3), any pre-
diction resulting from it must be understood within the
zero temperature limit. We remark that, at asymptoti-
cally earlier times t → −∞ for which both A(t), E(t) →
0, the system is assumed to meet equilibrium conditions.
In this limit the total energy of a Dirac quasiparticle

Observe that, in the limit Nin (cid:29) N 0, the Fermi energy
reduces to the expression known for gapless graphene
monolayers: εF ≈ (πv 2

Despite its compactness, the consequences embedded
in Eq. (3) are often facilitated via equivalent systems of
ordinary differential equations. Here we utilize one com-
bining two equations in which the Bogoliubov coefficients
f (ppp, t) and g(ppp, t) appear explicitly [12, 29]:5

i f (ppp, t) = appp(t)f (ppp, t) + bppp(t)g(ppp, t),
ppp (t)f (ppp, t) − appp(t)g(ppp, t).
i g(ppp, t) = b∗

(5)

In this context the distribution function is given by
Wg (ppp, t) = f (ppp, t)2 and the initial conditions are chosen
so that f (ppp,−∞) = 0 and g(ppp,−∞) = 1. The remaining
parameters contained in these formulas are given by

and so the Fermi level for the Dirac fermions.

5 Another representation involving three coupled ordinary differ-
ential equations can be found in the literature as well. See for
instance Refs. [13, 14, 44].

Further aspects deserve to be mentioned. It is worth
remarking that Eq. (3)  --  or alternatively Eq. (5)  -- 
strongly relies on the electron-hole symmetry. Hence,
its outcomes should provide good estimates within the
nearest-neighbours tight-binding model. However, if the
next-to-nearest-neighbours interactions are taken into ac-
count this invariance does not hold anymore [28] and cor-
rections due to this fact have to be included. We note
besides that the treatment based on these formulae ig-
nores the effect caused by both the collisions between
the created Dirac-quasiparticles and their inherent radi-
ation fields. Similar to QED [41 -- 43], both phenomena
are expected to become relevant as the field strength
is stronger than the critical field scale in bandgapped
f /e ∼ 105 V/cm. How-
graphene E (cid:38) Eg with Eg = m 2v 3
ever, for assessing the plausible materialization of the as-
sisted Schwinger mechanism in band-gapped graphene,
field strengths Es,w < Eg will be utilized.

Noteworthy, as the production of electron-hole pairs in
graphene is governed by a transport equation [see Eq. (3)]
which resembles the one in QED, various existing insights
linked to WQED(ppp, t) can be extrapolated to elucidate
the behavior of Wg (ppp, t). Thus, we expect that Wg (ppp, t)
mimics the resonances spectrum [12 -- 14] associated with
the absorption of quanta from the field [see Eq. (1)]. This
phenomenon takes place as the resonant condition

2¯εppp ≈ nsΩ + nwω

absorbed quanta from the strong (weak) wave, whereas

duced particles, i.e. the energy averaged over the total
pulse length τ . The behavior of the distribution function
WQED(ppp, t) near a resonance characterized by ns and nw

III. ENHANCED PRODUCTION OF

ELECTRON-HOLE PAIRS IN GRAPHENE

We wish to illustrate the phenomenological conse-
quences of the external field [see Eq. (1)] on the PP pro-
cess of massive charge carriers.
In line with Ref. [29]
we chose ∆ε = 0.26 eV as our standard band-gap value,
which corresponds to m = 11.7 keV/c2. A suitable real-
ization of the assisted scenario requires, in first instance,
a frequency for the perturbative wave carrying a sub-
stantial fraction of band gap energy [ω (cid:46) ∆ε]. The
strong field frequency Ω, on the other hand, should re-
main smaller than the difference between ∆ε and ω, i.e.,
Ω < ∆ε − ω. Because of this, we will take Ω = 0.026 eV
and ω = 0.206 eV, so that ns (cid:62) 3 is required for
any field strength. The plateau region will comprise
Nplateau = 26 cycles corresponding to a total pulse
length of τ = 2πN/Ω ≈ 4.2 ps. Here, the strong field
strength is taken Es = 4.9 × 104 V/cm which corre-
s = 6.4 × 106 W/cm2.
sponds to a laser intensity Is = cE2
The intensity of the perturbative laser wave is set to
Iw = 9.6 × 104 W/cm2,
leading to a field strength
Ew = 0.6 × 104 V/cm. Observe that, in the current sce-
f /e ≈ 2.6 × 105 V/cm
nario the critical field is Eg = m 2v 3
and, correspondingly, a critical scale for the laser inten-
g ≈ 1.8 × 108 W/cm2 can be set. Clearly,
sity Ig = cE2
the parameters above can be combined separately to
define the laser intensity parameter of the strong field
ξs = eEs/(mv f Ω) ≈ 0.94 and the perturbative fast-
oscillating field ξw = eEw/(mv f ω) ≈ 0.014. It is worth
emphasizing that none of the chosen intensities for the
waves overpasses the critical scale Is, Iw (cid:28) Ig .
In-
deed, all of them can be attained comfortably with ter-
ahertz laser systems with picosecond duration [46, 47].
Noteworthy, both the wavelengths associated with the
strong field λs ≈ 47.4 µm and the highly oscillating pulse
λw ≈ 5.9 µm exceed the characteristic formation lengths
lpair ∼ 10−2 µm [read discussion in the paragraph above
the one containing Eq. (3)].

Now, we solve the system of differential equations (5)
by varying the momentum components within the inter-
val −0.5 eV (cid:54) px,yvf (cid:54) 0.5 eV. The results of this
analysis are displayed in Fig. 1 in a density color scheme
which corresponds to log10[Wg (ppp, τ )]. While the upper
panel shows the outcomes associated with the mass-
less model, the consequences associated with the mass
m = 11.7 keV/c2 can be evaluated by comparing with
the middle panel. It is worth remarking that both pic-
tures were generated by considering the effects due to
the strong field only. Their main features  --  including the
occurrence of a narrow vertical blue sector in the mass-
less case  --  have been studied previously. For details, we
refer the reader to Ref. [29]. We note that these panels
have been added here to facilitate  --  via comparisons  -- 
the understanding of the main outcome resulting from a
scenario in which massive Dirac quasiparticles are pro-
duced by the combined effect of both the strong and the
perturbative fast-oscillating wave [lower panel]. Observe

5

that the three spectral densities are sharply anisotropic
with respect to the momentum components, and mani-
fest gradual decrements as both px and py increase. The
stretching along py is understood as a result of the min-
imal coupling between the external field and the quasi-
particle via the kinetic momentum py − eA(t)/c, which
enters into the quasienergy [see below Eq. (7)]. Hence,
the creation of quasiparticle-hole pairs with rather large
longitudinal momentum is more likely to take place.

All panels in Fig. 1 are characterized by ringlike struc-
tures which differ between each other. Each ring is under-
stood as an isocontour of fixed quasienergy ¯εppp satisfying
the resonance condition in Eq. (7). The regions encom-
passed between two neighboring rings are characterized
by less intense colors, this way indicating the formation
of intermediate valleys. Observe that the outcome shown
in the middle panel, i.e.
for massive carriers with the
fast-oscillating field turned off, looks rather different as
compared with the model of massless Dirac quasiparticles
[upper]. Clearly the number of resonances in the former
is considerably smaller than in the latter case where the
red-colored area is much more pronounced and compact.
In view of this behavior, we can infer that the volume be-
low the surface Wg (px, py) will be substantially larger in
the massless model [upper panel] than in the case where
the Dirac quasiparticles are massive and only the strong
field is on [middle panel]. As these volumes result from
the integration over the momentum components, actu-
ally they will determine the number of yielded pairs per
unit of area

(cid:90)

N g = lim

t→∞ gsgv

d2p
(2π)2 Wg (ppp, t).

(9)

We remark that the factor gs = 2 (gv = 2) accounts for
the spin (valley) degeneracy. Formally, the integration
has to be performed over all the Fourier space. However,
the outcomes given in Fig. 1 provide evidences that the
contribution of W g (ppp, τ ) is almost insignificant as long
as px, py > 10 eV/vf . This fact is consistent with the
limitation indicated above Eq. (3). Hence, to compute
Eq. (9) numerically we will restrict the integration do-
main to an area A embedded within a circle with radius
ppp (cid:28) 10 eV/vf .

The situation changes when massive Dirac quasipar-
ticles experience both the strong and the perturbative
fast-oscillating wave simultaneously [lower panel]. Ow-
ing to the latter, the number of resonances increases and
the red area enlarges considerably as compared with the
panel in the middle. This fact makes clear that the cor-
responding volume below the surface W g (px, py), i.e. the
density of produced electron-hole pairs, increases in com-
parison to the situation where m = 11.7 keV/c2 with the
perturbative wave being switched off. Certainly, the red
area in the lower panel turns out to be less intense than
in the upper one [m = 0]. However, in the former case,
the red portion covers regions in the (px, py)-plane that
the upper panel does not. Consequently, the volume en-
closed by W g (px, py) in the assisted setting could reach

FIG. 1: Logarithmic plot of the single-particle distribution
functions Wg (ppp, τ ). The result shown in the upper panel cor-
responds to a model involving massless charge carriers. Con-
versely, the middle and lower panels display outcomes ob-
tained by considering massive Dirac quasiparticles. The dis-
tributions in the upper and middle panels follow from the
strong field only, i.e. Ew = 0, while the lower one takes into
account that both the strong and the fast-oscillating waves are
present. The following benchmark parameters have been used
∆ε = 0.26 eV, Es = 4.9 × 104 V/cm, Ew = 0.6 × 104 V/cm,
Nplateau = 26 cycles (τ ≈ 4.2 ps), Ω = 0.026 eV and
ω = 0.206 eV.

FIG. 2: Density of produced electron-hole pairs as a function of Es[left panel] and Ew[right panel]. The blue curve in the left
panel reveals the trend obtained for the massless model when the weak field is off. For the same field setting, the lower curves
in green and red  --  both with more pronounced slopes as compared with the remaining curves  --  result from considering massive
Dirac quasiparticles with bandgaps ∆ε = 0.12 eV and ∆ε = 0.26 eV, respectively. The corresponding outcomes resulting from
the configuration assisted by the perturbative fast-oscillating wave share the previous color scheme but the curves are those
containing asterisks. Both assisted curves have been obtained by setting Ew = 0.6 × 104 V/cm. The results exhibited in both
panels were obtained by setting the pulse length Nplateau = 26 cycles (τ ≈ 4.2 ps) and the strong field frequency Ω = 0.026 eV.
Besides, for ∆ε = 0.26 eV the frequency of the perturbative field was chosen ω = 0.206 eV, whereas for ∆ε = 0.12 eV we
have utilized ω = 0.09 eV. The curves in the right panel have been obtained by considering the two previous gaps: green for
∆ε = 0.12 eV and red for ∆ε = 0.26 eV. There the strong field was taken as Es = 4.9 × 104 V/cm with Ω = 0.026 eV.

values comparable to the one associated with the sce-
nario involving massless carriers and, so for the density
of created pairs [see Eq. (9)].

In order to verify this enhancement, we compute nu-
merically the dependence of N g [see Eq. (9)] with respect
to the strong electric field strength Es. The results of this
assessment are summarized in the left panel of Fig. 2.
The outcome linked to the massless model is shown in
blue, whereas those resulting from scenarios driven by
massive Dirac quasiparticles characterized by a bandgap
∆ε = 0.26 eV are depicted in red. For comparison, the
results linked to a reduced gap ∆ε = 0.12 eV have been
included [green curves with an adjusted fast-oscillating
frequency ω = 0.09 eV]. We note that the latter cor-
responds to a mass m = 5.4 keV/c2 and a critical field
strength Eg ≈ 5.5 × 104 V/cm which is an order of mag-
nitude smaller than the one associated with the energy
gap ∆ε = 0.26 eV, i.e. Eg ≈ 2.6 × 105 V/cm. The right
panel in Fig. 2 shows the dependence of N g on the weak
field strength Ew. Each curve corresponds to one of the
nontrivial bandgaps: green for ∆ε = 0.12 eV and red for
∆ε = 0.26 eV. Both have been obtained by setting the
strong field to Es = 4.9 × 104 V/cm. As the previous
strength is comparable to the critical field linked to the
gap ∆ε = 0.12 eV, the corresponding results have to be
considered as estimates. Referring to the red curve, we
see that the density of pairs grows from left to right by
a factor of ≈ 20 when the amplitude of the weak field is
increased by a factor of 8, implying an average growth
which is faster than linear. For comparison we note that,
for PP by a bichromatic electric field in a pure QED con-

text [12], a linear dependence on Ew (respectively ξw)
has been obtained to a good approximation. This simple
scaling behavior may be attributed to the range of field
parameters considered there.

Now, throughout the whole range of Es [left panel]
the number of pairs yielded from the assisted scenario
 --  green and red curves marked with asterisks  --  is sub-
stantially larger than those arising when the perturba-
tive fast-oscillating field is off, i.e. green and red curves
marked with crosses. We note that, in a scenario with an
energy gap ∆ε = 0.26 eV and Es ≈ 2.7 × 104 V/cm, the
result of the assisted setup exceeds the outcome driven by
a pure strong field setup by four orders of magnitude. For
comparison we note that the presence of the assisting field
[Ew = 0.6 × 104 V/cm, ω = 0.206 eV] enhances the pair
yield in the massless model by only a factor 2, approxi-
mately. As  --  in average  --  the slopes of those curves linked
to a pure strong field scenario [m (cid:54)= 0] are larger than the
corresponding one in the assisted setting, the enhance-
ment effect due to the weak field diminishes as Es grows
[see also Refs. [8, 18 -- 20]]. This behavior can be expected
because  --  in an assisted scenario  --  there are two paths
for increasing the number of produced pairs. Namely, ei-
ther by growing the strong field strength or through the
absorption of energetic quanta, this way promoting the
emergence of new resonances. While the former becomes
more relevant as Es grows, the latter dominates as the
opposite situation takes place.

Noteworthy, those curves linked to scenarios in which
the production of massive electron-hole pairs is driven by
the strong field only, manifest pronounced steep fallings

[see, e.g., [12, 29, 48, 49]]. Also the results associated with
the assisted setups reveal these drop-offs, although much
less noticeable due to the large scale covered by the verti-
cal axis. We recall that the channel-closing phenomenon
can be attributed to the extinction of a resonance at those
field strengths for which W g (ppp, τ ) is locally minimized.
Indeed, in the absence of a perturbative fast-oscillating
wave, the number of produced pairs can increase through
the growing of the strong field strength Es. When this
happens, the quasienergies that characterize the reso-
nances [see below Eq. (7)] change too. Most of theses
resonances  --  featured by a specific ns  --  survive during
the electric field change because  --  when integrating over
ppp  --  a readjustment in the corresponding momentum oc-
curs in such a way that the relations 2εppp = nsΩ still
hold. However, throughout the change, the minimal en-
ergy to be absorbed from the field  --  εppp=0  --  might die out,
this way compensating the enhancement induced by the
strong field increment. If this occurs, the volume below
the surface W g (px, py) diminishes and a drop-off emerges
in the plane (N g , Es). That this behavior does not man-
ifest in the assisted curves may be then understood as a
direct consequence of the additional production channel
that the assisted scenario provides. Within the context
of the resonant condition [see Eq. (7)], this manifests via
the term which contains the number of quanta nw ab-
sorbed from the weak field.

Let us finally estimate the number of electron-hole
pairs produced by a single shot in a sheet of graphene
with a characteristic length (cid:96) ∼ 10 µm. Consider first
the nonassisted scenario with Es ≈ 5.6 × 104 V/cm
for which N g ∼ 106 cm−2.
and m = 11.7 keV/c2,
Under such circumstances the number of pairs created
from the vacuum in a single shot is N g (cid:96)2 ∼ 1 approx-
imately. However, if the previous setup is assisted by
a perturbative fast-oscillating wave with ω = 0.206 eV
and Ew ≈ 3 × 104 V/cm, the density of pairs reaches
values of the order of N g ∼ 108 cm−2. As a consequence
the number of electron-hole pairs produced by a single
shot would be of the order of Npairs ≈ N g (cid:96)2 ∼ 102,
i.e. two orders of magnitude larger than in the nonas-
sisted configuration. The layer could accumulate a much
larger number of electron-hole pairs by taking advan-
tage of the laser repetition rate. For instance, val-
ues of the order of Npairs ∼ 106 could be reached af-
ter nshots ∼ 104 laser shots. For a repetition rate of
ν ∼ O(10 − 100) Hz, this would require to irradiate the
sample during O(2 − 17) min, approximately. After this
period the density of produced electron-hole pairs reaches
values of the order of N f = nshotsN g ∼ 1012 cm−2 which
exceeds by 2 orders of magnitude the density obtained
from a single shot in a model with no gap [see blue curve,
left panel in Fig. 2].
We note that for a final density N f ∼ 1012 cm−2 the
electrostatic interactions becomes relevant [50, 51]. This
way facilitating the attraction between carriers with dif-
ferent charges and, thus, the formation of excitons i.e.

7

the analog of the positronium in a pure QED context. As
in the latter scenario, the formed excitons are expected
to be unstable bound states which decay into photons.
In first instance, the detection of these photons would
constitute a direct signature of a prior realization of the
assisted pair creation process. A study of the annihilation
channels is beyond the scope of the present investigation,
but they will be analyzed in a forthcoming publication.

IV. CONCLUSION

Matter-antimatter pair creation via the Schwinger
mechanism is one of the most striking nonperturbative
phenomena in quantum field theory. Since it has eluded
any experimental verification, so far, catalyzing mecha-
nisms in nonstatic macroscopic gauge fields prove very
promising in order to circumvent the dramatic suppres-
sion of the creation rate. Alternatively, one may also
look for analog realizations in appropriate low energy
condensed matter systems like graphene. In contrast to
earlier studies, we have focused on scenarios where a tiny
bandgap is present in the vicinity of its Dirac points,
giving rise to the characteristic tunneling exponential in
the Schwinger pair creation rate. This feature has al-
lowed us to verify theoretically that such semiconducting
graphene varieties are rather suitable not only to probe
the Schwinger effect but also the proposed mechanism of
dynamical assistance.

Employing a quantum kinetic approach with reduced
effective dimensionality, we first have computed the cor-
responding single-particle distribution function for ex-
perimentally motivated field parameters.
In doing so,
we have verified that the presence of an assisting weak
field can yield a notably enhancement, approaching val-
ues obtained for ordinary massless graphene via the stan-
dard PP mechanism. For all configurations a character-
istic resonant behavior, reflected in form of isocontours
of fixed quasienergy, has been identified in the momen-
tum plane. Based on the obtained distribution func-
tions, we then have computed the total number of created
quasiparticle-hole pairs. We have shown that the latter
enabled via the assisted mechanism turned out to be sev-
eral orders of magnitude larger than in the nonassisted
process. We have argued that, with a suitable laser repe-
tition rate, the density of produced electron-hole pairs in-
creases by several orders of magnitude, allowing to reach
the level from which the emission of photons  --  as a result
of the recombination process  --  becomes a clear signature
of the assisted Schwinger mechanisms.
