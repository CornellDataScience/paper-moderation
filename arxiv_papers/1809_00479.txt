Abstract: Measurement of gravitational Hawking radiation of black hole (BH) is prohibitive 

because  of  an  extremely  low  Hawking  temperature  (TH).  Here  we  demonstrate  a  fermionic 

analog of BH with a super high TH ~ 3 K, which is several orders of magnitude  higher than 

previous  works.  We  propose  that  Floquet-Dirac  states,  formed  in  a  periodically  laser  driven 

two-dimensional  black  phosphorous  thin  film,  can  be  designed  with  a  spatial  gradient  to 

mimic  the  "gravity"  felt  by  fermionic  quasiparticles  as  that  for  a  Schwarzschild  BH  (SBH). 

Quantum tunneling of electrons from a type-II Dirac cone (inside BH) to a type-I Dirac cone 

(outside) emits a SBH-like Hawking radiation spectrum.

Gravitational black hole (BH) is a curved spacetime absorbing everything inside its event 

horizon  because  of  an  extremely  large  mass/radius  ratio,  as  characterized  by  overtilted  light 

cones according to general relativity theory. This notion of nothing escapes from a BH is no 

longer  valid  if  quantum  effects  are  considered.  According  to  Hawking  [1-3],  quantum 

fluctuations  at  the  event  horizon  generate  particles  and  antiparticles  to  propagate  out  of  and 

into the BH, respectively. Consequently, a BH evaporates thermally like a black body, known 

as  Hawking  radiation,  as  shown  in  the  upper  panel  of  Fig.  1.  The  intensity  of  this  quantum 

radiation  is  quantified  by  Hawking  temperature  (TH  =  κ/2π  with  the  gravity  κ  at  the  event 

horizon),  which  is  however  extremely  low,  ~10−8  K  for  a  BH  with  one  solar  mass  [1].  This 

prohibitively  weak  intensity  presents  a  significant  challenge  to  directly  observe  Hawking 

radiation.  Previously,  artificial  analogs  have  been  proposed  including  sonic  BHs  [4,  5]  in 

Bose-Einstein  condensates  [6-9],  ion  rings  [10],  and  Fermi-degenerate  liquids  [11]. 

Unfortunately,  TH  for  most  artificial  BHs  is  still  very  low,  e.g.  ~  10-9  K  in  Bose-Einstein 

condensates  [7].  Furthermore,  the  observation  from  some  optical  BH  analogs  remains 

controversial [12-21]. Therefore, new  BH  analogs inherent  with  quantum  effect and  a much 

higher TH are highly desirable.  

Recently, type-II Weyl/Dirac fermions in solids have been proposed as a new platform to 

realize artificial BHs [22-27]. In the regions where type-II and type-I fermions are separated 

by a boundary with type-III fermions (i.e. the "event horizon"), two worlds inside and outside 

a BH are analogously formed (lower panel of Fig. 1). Quantum mechanics enables Hawking 

radiation of quasiparticles at the event horizon, which can simulate fermions radiation from a 

real  BH  [28-30].  Thanks  to  the  fact  that  electrostatic  interactions  in  solids  are  orders-of-

magnitude  stronger  than  gravitational  forces,  an  unprecedented  high  TH  is  expected.  Our 

previous  work  shows  that  laser-driven  black  phosphorus  (BP)  can  host  type-I,  -II  and  -III 

fermions [25], manifesting a potential fermionic analogue of BH. In order to materialize this 

idea two requirements are necessary:  (i) a spatial  distribution of band structure to  produce  a 

"steep" analogous gravity field, and (ii) a working mechanism to induce fermionic Hawking 

radiation. 

In this article, we theoretically propose a fermionic analogue of BH in two-dimensional 

 

 2 / 14 

(2D) BP thin film under laser illumination, which is designed to be experimentally accessible. 

Combining  first-principles  and  quantum  tunneling  calculations,  a  spatially  inhomogeneous 

system  with  successively  distributed  type-II,  -III  and  -I  Dirac  fermions  is  illustrated,  which 

acts like an Schwarzschild BH (SBH) metric to induce electron emission from type-II to type-

I region. An effective gravity field corresponding to a striking high temperature TH ~ 3 K is 

achieved.  

Dirac  fermions  are  classified  into  different  types,  and  successive  transitions  between 

them in 2D can be described by the Hamiltonian 

H(k) = cxkxσx + cykyσy + vkyσ0 ,                                                (1) 

where 

 , 

, and σ0 is the identity matrix. Dispersions in ky direction are 

ε1 = (v + cy)ky and ε2 = (v − cy)ky, whose crossing forms Dirac cone with Fermi velocities vF1 = 

v  +  cy  and  vF2  =  v  −  cy,  respectively.  The  nodal  point  of  the  cone  is  known  as  Dirac  point, 

whose energy is marked as εD. vF1 and vF2 can be tuned by changing v and cy, leading to three 

types of cones with distinct band dispersions and Fermi surfaces. For an upright type-I Dirac 

cone, cy >> v, vF1 = −vF2. When the upright cone tilts, cy and v decreases, and we elaborate 

here on a  clockwise tilt having  cy > 0 and  v < 0  [see Fig. 2(a)]. The cone remains as type-I 

when cy decreases from +∞ to −v (cy > −v). At the critical point (cy = −v), the cone has a flat 

band of ε1 (vF1 = 0, vF2 < 0), which is dubbed type-III with a line-like Fermi surface [24, 25]. 

Beyond  the  critical  point,  an  overtilted  cone  is  named  type-II  having  cy  <  −v,  whose  two 

Fermi  velocities  have  the  same  sign  (vF1,  vF2  <  0)  and  Fermi  surface  encompasses  both 

electron and hole pockets. 

We  next  transform  the  Dirac  fermions  in  crystals  to  the  particles  in  gravity  field.  In 

Einstein's notation, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as H(k) = ej

iσ jki + e0

iσ0ki .  i, j = 1, 2 (or x, y) and 

the matrix ej

i and vector e0

i are equivalent to components of a tetrad field eα

μ (α, μ = 0, 1, 2 in 

2  +  1  dimensions)  in  general  relativity.  Then,  an  effective  relativistic  covariant  metric  gμν  = 

(ηαβeα

μeβ

ν)−1 with ηαβ = diag(−1,1,1) governs Dirac fermions. The corresponding line element 

(ds2 = gμνdxμdxν) is

which  shows  the  behavior  of  Dirac  quasiparticles  in  an  effective  2  +  1  dimensional  (t,  x,  y) 

spacetime.  For  v  =  0,  ds2  =  −cy

2dt2  +  dy2  in  (t,  y)  spacetime,  representing  a  flat  spacetime 

where  electronic  wave  propagates  at  the  velocity  of  cy  along  ±y  directions.  Hence,  cy 

corresponds  to  light  velocity  (c)  in  the  gravitational  spacetime,  so  that  Dirac  wave 

propagating in a crystal field is formally equivalent to light propagating in a gravity field. In 

contrast  to  a  constant  c,  however,  the  "light  velocity"  (cy)  in  a  crystal  can  be  changed  by 

interactions. 

Effective  spacetime  for  a  given  type  of  Dirac  fermion  can  be  designed  by  the  relative 

magnitude of cy and v. The Dirac cone manifests in its "spacetime" as an artificial light cone 

(ds2 = 0) with 

 and 

, as shown in Fig. 2(b). For type-I, t1' = 1/(v + cy) > 0 and 

t2'  =  1/(v  −  cy)  <  0  having  the  opposite  sign,  quasiparticles  propagate  along  both  +y  and   -- y 

directions.  For  type-III,  t1  →  ∞,  one  branch  of  quasiparticles  stays  at  a  fixed  location  (the 

event horizon) permanently while the other propagates along  -- y direction (t2' < 0). For type-II, 

both  t1'  and  t2'  are  negative,  all  quasiparticles  propagate  along   -- y  direction  resembling  the 

unidirectional behavior of particles inside a SBH. 

To produce a desired gravity field for Dirac fermions, an appropriate spatial distribution 

of effective geometry is designed. Matching the effective and Schwarzschild metrics [31], the 

effective potential energy of quasiparticles is 

. Φ(y) is inversely proportional to 

the  distance: 

,  where  yh  is  the  location  of  event  horizon.  Consequently,  the 

effective light velocity cy distributes along the y direction as 

 

 

 

 

. 

 

 

              

 

(3)  

This  guarantees  that  type-II  fermions  are  inside  the  BH  (0  <  y  <  yh),  type-III  at  the  event 

horizon (y = yh) and type-I outside the BH (y > yh) [Fig. 2(c)]. The motion of quasiparticles is 

described  by  kinematic  equations  of 

 and 

.  As  shown  in  Fig.

outgoing wave outside the BH. At the event horizon, there is such a high potential barrier that 

quasiparticles  occupying  on  the  ε1  band  are  impossible  to  go  through  classically,  but  can 

tunnel through via quantum fluctuation to produce Hawking radiation.  

Next,  using  quantum  tunneling  method  [29,  32],  we  analyze  the  analogous  Hawking 

radiation at the effective BH event horizon with the curved geometry of Eq. (3). As illustrated 

in Fig. 2(c), the ε1 states above the Dirac point (ε1 > εD) are occupied inside the BH, but empty 

outside.  This  leads  to  emission  of  the  excited  electrons  from  inside  to  outside  the  BH. 

Adopting  Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin  approximation,  the  tunneling  probability  is  P  = 

1/(1+exp(2S))  with  a  classical  action  S  =  Im∫ky(y)dy.  Assuming 

 for 

the ky1 branch around the event horizon, P produces a spectrum with the energy intensity I(ε) 

= ne

rad(ε)·ε. The number of radiated electrons follows  

,                                                        (4) 

where  kB  is  the  Boltzmann  constant,  and 

is  the  Hawking  temperature. 

 

The  energy  spectrum  I(ε)  =  ne

rad(ε)·ε  of  radiated  massless  Dirac  electrons  conforms  to  the 

thermal radiation  of massless Dirac particles from  a 2D gravitational  BH (see  Supplemental 

Material  [33]).  The  "radiated"  electrons  and  holes  created  by  quantum  fluctuation  are 

entangled  (lower  panel  in  Fig.  1).  It  will  also  be  very  interesting  to  study  the  correlation 

effects between  a Hawking pair (electron-hole pair) using our proposed fermionic analog of 

BH,  such  as  by  detecting  and  analyzing  the  distributions  of  both  electrons  (in  the  type-II 

region) and holes (type-I region) simultaneously resulted from quantum tunneling. 

The radiated Hawking spectrum I(ε) can be measured from the local electron distribution 

n(ε)  in  the  region  y  >  yh,  using  scanning  tunneling  spectroscopy  or  angle  resolved 

photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). As shown in Fig. 2(e), the energy of ε = 0 is set as the 

Fermi  level  (εF),  at  which  Dirac  point  and  chemical  potential  locate  (εD  =  εF  =  0).  The 

spectrum ne

rad(ε) with ε > εD has a peak at εp = 0.3 meV for TH = 3 K, which is distinct from

rad(ε)  for  radiated  holes  below  εD  due  to  quantum 

tunneling  is  similar.  The  Hawking  spectrum  (in  2D)  derived  here  is  the  same  as  that  of 

massless fermions  emitted from  a 2D BH, providing a key signature  for  Hawking radiation. 

TH  can  be  tuned  by  controlling  the  effective  gravity  field  to  facilitate  the  experimental 

detection of ne

rad(ε) and nh

rad(ε). The relation between εp and TH follows 

, 

leading  to  a  linear  dependence  εp  =  1.28·kBTH  [Fig.  2(f)].  An  unprecedentedly  high  TH  is 

achieved  because  interactions  in  crystals  are  orders-of-magnitude  stronger  than  those  in 

gravity field and Bose-Einstein condensate. 

Next, we theoretically design a solid-state system to realize such a fermionic analogue of 

BH.  By  applying  a  gate  with  the  vertical  electric  field  Eext  or  compressive  strain  δ  along 

armchair (x) direction, the direct band gap of 2D BP thin film decreases [25, 34-40], leading 

to an inversion Δε of valence (ε1) and conduction (ε2) bands. Symmetry-protected type-I Dirac 

cone emerges, which was confirmed by ARPES [37, 38]. For a bilayer BP, this Dirac state is 

shown in Fig. 3(c), where Δε = 14 meV at Γ point is induced by Eext = 0.18 V/Å or δ = 7.6 % 

(see Fig. S1 for details [33]).  

To form the three types  of Dirac states by laser-driving, we study coherent  interactions 

between  the  bilayer  BP  and  a  linearly  polarized  laser  (LPL)  with  a  time-dependent  vector 

potential A(t) = A0sin(ωt, 0, 0) [Fig. 3(a)]. The photon energy of the time-periodic and space-

homogeneous  LPL  is  chosen  as  ℏω  =  0.03  eV,  which  is  larger  than  Δε  =  14  meV  to  avoid 

crossing  nearby  Dirac  point  between  the  original  (n  =  0)  and  photon-dressed  (n  ≠  0)  bands. 

When the LPL is applied, the type-I Dirac cone tilts due to the hybridization between n = 0 

and n ≠ 0 bands. At the critical laser amplitude A0 = 16 V/c (corresponding to 0.24 mV/Å or 

7.65 × 105 W/cm2, here c is light velocity), ε1 band along ΓY path becomes flat, forming type-

III Dirac cone [Fig. 3(d)]. As the laser amplitude increases to A0 = 20 V/c, the Dirac cone tilts 

further  to  become  type-II  [Fig.  3(e)].  Then  the  slope  of  ε1  and  ε2  dispersions  has  the  same 

sign,  and  the  states  of  the  ε1  band  above  Fermi  level  (ε1  >  0  eV)  becomes  occupied. 

Consequently, type-I, II and -III Dirac fermions are created in a single material of 2D BP by a 

varying laser intensity. In addition, laser frequency plays also a crucial role in determining the 

 

 6 / 14 

1expppBHBHkTkTtype of cones, which is shown in the phase diagram of Fig. 3(b). 

To mimic the spacetime geometry of Eq. (2), we map the photoinduced Dirac states from 

ab initio calculations to model parameters in Eq. (1). As shown in Fig. 3(f), the parameter v = 

−0.1 eV·Å is constant, while cy decreases gradually with increasing A0, showing the transition 

from type-I (cy > −v) to type-II (cy < −v). In the regime of strong (weak) laser intensity, cy and 

A0 exhibit a linear (nonlinear) relation, which is a typical characteristics of optical Stark effect 

(see details in Fig. S3 [33]). Neglecting the small nonlinearity, one can fit cy and A0 as 

cy[eV·Å] = 0.314  --  0.013A0[V/c],                                              (5) 

which is the base to explore Hawking radiation in the laser-driven bilayer BP thin film.  

Substituting cy in Eq. (3) with Eq. (5), the amplitude of space-inhomogeneous laser field 

is

,  leading  to 

.  Similar  to 

 for  a 

gravitational BH, the TH of the proposed artificial BH is inversely proportional to the size (yh) 

of a BH. In the cases of gravitational BH, rh is determined by the mass of BH, rh=2GM, which 

is  large  producing  extremely  low  TH.  Here  we  could  intentionally  control  the  focus  area  of 

light with suitable intensity to achieve a small rh and thus a high TH. To achieve TH = 3 K, the 

BH size is set at yh = 30.2 Å, which requires the laser field to decrease from 0.37 to 0 mV/Å 

in  a  range  of  260  Å  along  the  zigzag  (y)  direction  of  BP  [Fig.  4(a)].  This  gradient  of  laser 

intensity can be readily realized in experiments [46-48]. This temperature is realizable based 

on typical  conditions of the laser  experiment, as  well as the validity of lattice periodicity  as 

required  by  Bloch  band  theory.  The  radiation  can  be  detected  by  measuring  electron 

distribution n(ε) = n0 (ε) + ne

rad(ε)  nh

rad(ε) in the region y > yh, where ne

rad(ε) and nh

rad(ε) are 

the radiated spectrum of electrons and holes in Fig. 2(e), respectively, and n0 (ε) is the electron 

distribution  before  radiation.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4(b),  the  peak  position  εp  of  the  calculated 

distribution n(ε) is 0.3 meV above the Fermi level. Decreasing the BH size, εp increases in a 

wide range of TH [Fig. 4(c)]. Also, we note that there are a pair of Dirac cones along  -- YY path 

resembling  black  and  white  holes  respectively,  but  their  coexistence  does  not  influence  the 

Hawking radiation (see details in Fig. S4 [33]).  

In conclusion, type-I, -II and -III Dirac fermions are predicted to form in 2D BP thin film

is  theoretically  estimated  to  reach  3  K,  with  the  emitted  electrons  exhibiting  a  spectrum 

peaked  at  0.3  meV  above  the  Fermi  level,  which  should  be  experimentally  observable.  Our 

finding  opens  a  path  to  engineering  the  table-top  fermionic  condensed-matter  platform  for

FIG. 1. Schematic illustration of gravitational Hawking radiation and fermionic analog. Upper panel: 

Light  cones  in  real  space  indicate  that  particles  cannot  escape  from  gravitational  BH  classically 

(arrowed  straight  line),  but  particles  and  antiparticles  can  emit  from  event  horizon  due  to  quantum 

fluctuation  (arrowed  wavy  line).  Lower  panel:  Dirac  cones  in  momentum  space  show  that  electrons 

cannot escape from the type-II region (arrowed straight line) of the artificial BH in crystals, quantum 

tunneling  enables  emission  of  electrons  and  holes  from  the  event  horizon  (type-III  region)  to  type-I 

and -II regions respectively (arrowed wavy line).

FIG. 2. Schematic illustration of fermionic analogue of a BH and consequent Hawking radiation. (a) 

Fermi velocity vF of Dirac cone varies with cy, resulting in the transition from type-I (green), type-III 

(red) to type-II (blue) Dirac cone successively. (b) Three types of artificial light cone (green, red, and 

blue)  formed  via  counterclockwise  rotation,  corresponding  to  type-  I,  -III,  and  -II  Dirac  fermions 

respectively. (c) The distribution of cy of type-I, -III, and -II Dirac fermions appears successively along 

+y  direction,  producing  the  same  "gravity  field"  felt  by  electrons  as  that  of  particles  in  a  SBH.  (d) 

Kinematic equation shows a high potential barrier at yh to prevent electrons from escaping from type-II 

to  type-I  region,  but  this  process  takes  place  by  quantum  tunneling  indicated  by  the  arrowed  red 

dashed line in (c) and (d). (e) The spectrum of electrons (left) and holes (right) produced by Hawking 

radiation with TH = 3 K. (f) The relation between the peak position εp in (e) and TH.

FIG. 3. First-principles calculated photoinduced type-I,  -II  and  -III Dirac fermions in bilayer BP. (a) 

Laser field A(t) = A0(sin(ωt),0,0) is polarized along armchair (x) direction. (b) Dirac states induced by 

laser  with  different  amplitude  A0  and  frequency  ω.  (c)  Band  structure  of  bilayer  BP  under  vertical 

static electric field of 0.17 V/Å (or 7.6% compressive strain). Floquet-Bloch band structure of bilayer 

BP driven by laser with A0 = 16 V/c (d) and A0 = 20 V/c (e), and photon energy ℏω = 0.03 eV. (f) With 

increasing laser intensity, type-I Dirac fermion is transitioned to be type- III, and -II successively. The 

gray dashed line shows linear fitting of cy vs. A0.

intensity  distribution  along  zigzag  (y)  direction  to  realize  a  SBH  with  TH  =  3  K.  (b)  The  electron 

distribution  n(ε)  at  y  >  yh  after  Hawking  radiation  with  TH  =  3  K.  The  n0(ε)  before  Hawking 

radiation  is  shown  by  the  gray-dashed  line.  (c) The  calculated  dependence  of  TH  on  the  location  of 

event horizon. The red dot corresponds to TH = 3 K and εp = 0.33 meV.
