We propose a model to account for the observed ESR-like signal at the Larmor frequency in
the current noise STM experiments identifying spin centers on various substrates. The theoretical
understanding of this phenomenon, which allows for single spin detection on surfaces at room tem-
perature, is not settled for the experimentally relevant case that the tip and substrate are not spin
polarized. Our model is based on a direct tip-substrate tunneling in parallel with a current flowing
via the spin states. We find a sharp signal at the Larmor frequency even at high temperatures, in
good agreement with experimental data. We also evaluate the noise in presence of an ac field near
resonance and predict splitting of the signal by the Rabi frequency.

Observing and manipulating single spins is of consid-
erable interest in quantum information. A particularly
promising method of detecting a single spin on a sur-
face is by using a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)
[1]. The technique has been initiated and developed by
Y. Manassen and various collaborators and has the ap-
pealing feature of being useful at ambient conditions, in
contrast to other techniques operating at very low tem-
peratures [2]. It is based on monitoring the noise, i.e. the
current-current correlations, in the STM current and ob-
serving a signal at the expected Larmor frequency, similar
to an Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) experiment, except
that here no oscillating field is applied. The frequency of
the signal varies linearly with the applied magnetic field,
confirming that the STM in fact detects an isolated spin
on the surface. This phenomenon was demonstrated on
oxidized Si(111) surface [3, 4]. Afterwards it was also
observed in Fe atoms [5] on Si(111) as well as on a vari-
ety of organic molecules on a graphite surface [6] and on
Au(111) surfaces [7 -- 9]. Recent extensions have resolved
two resonance peaks on oxidized Si(111) 7 × 7 surface
corresponding to site specific g factors [10, 11] and also
enabled the observation of the hyperfine coupling [1, 12].

The theoretical understanding of the ESR-STM effect
is not settled [1]. The emergence of a finite frequency in
a steady state stationary situation is a non-trivial phe-
nomenon. An obvious mechanism for coupling the charge
current to the spin precession is spin-orbit coupling [13].
It was shown, that an ESR signal is present in the noise of
systems with spin-orbit coupling only when the leads are
polarized, either for a strong Coulomb interaction [14, 15]
or for the non-interacting case [15]. This was shown even
in linear response [16]. However, it was found that the
signal vanishes when the lead polarization vanishes or
with parallel polarizations. In the experiments the leads
are very weakly polarized by the magnetic field with po-
larization parallel to that of the localized spin, hence the
ESR signal vanishes within these models [14, 15]. It was
argued that an effective spin polarization is realized as a
fluctuation effect either for a small number of electrons

that pass the localized spin in one cycle [17] or due to
1/f magnetic noise of the tunneling current [18]. It was
further shown that spin-orbit coupling in an asymmet-
ric dot can yield an oscillating electric dipole, possibly
affecting the STM current [19].

In the present work we start by showing that the prob-
lem of tunneling via spin states in the presence of spin-
orbit interaction has strictly no resonance signal; the
presence of an electric dipole coupling does not change
this conclusion. We then study a model in which an addi-
tional direct coupling between the dot and the reservoir is
included. Our model is motivated by studies of quantum
dots with spin-orbit [20] and by STM studies of a two-
impurity Kondo system that shows a significant direct
coupling between the tip and substrate states [21, 22].
We find that the interference of the direct current and
the one via the spin does show an ESR signal in the noise,
which increases with the direct coupling. This feature is
consistent with the unusual non-monotonic contour plot
presented in Refs. 3, 4, i.e.
the signal is maximized
when the STM tip is not directly on the spin center but
slightly (∼ 1nm) away, so as to maximize an overlap with
a surface state of the substrate. The signal intensity rel-
ative to the background is small, yet it is sharp even at
temperatures much higher than the ESR frequency; the
consistency of this behavior with the experimental data
is discussed below. Finally, we also evaluate the noise in
presence of an ac field near resonance and predict split-
ting of the signal.

The setup we consider consists of a molecule M with
spin 1/2 on a metallic substrate and also in contact with
an STM tip. The tip and the substrate define two elec-
tron reservoirs T, S. The two states of the molecule, as-
sociated to the two spin orientations of the molecule have
energies separated by a Zeeman splitting due to an exter-
nal magnetic field B = Bez, and are coupled by tunneling
processes to the two reservoirs. We assume, in addition,
spin-orbit (SO) coupling, which renders these tunneling
terms spin dependent, in particular allowing for tunnel-

ing with spin-flip. The Hamiltonian is

H = Xα=T,S

Hα + HM + Xα=T,S
The first term, with Hα = Pkα,σ εkαc†

kα,σckα,σ, corre-
sponds to the unpolarized reservoirs. The molecule is
described by the simple model

HM,α.

ans of the unpolarized reservoirs. The result is HM,α =
kα,σdσ + H.c]. Hence, the full Hamiltonian is a
sum over two decoupled spin states and observables such
as current noise cannot present any feature depending on
the level spacing in the molecule, as previously noted in
a detailed calculation [15].

The next ingredient to explore is a molecular electric
dipole er that couples to an electric field E, e.g. due
to tip proximity [19]. Assuming a molecule with several
levels, in the absence of E, HM has eigenstates m, σi
with eigenvalues Em ± 1
2 ωz,m (m = 0 is the ground state)
where ωz,m is the splitting due to a Zeeman term HZ.
Extending the one-dimensional model [19], the oscillating
electric dipole ∼ e−iωz,0t can be described by the 2nd
order matrix element

for
hm, −HZ0, +i 6= 0 for m 6= 0. Adding this off-diagonal
term to HM results in eigenstates related to 0, ±i, i.e.
dσ, by a unitary spin rotation. Therefore Eqs. (2) and
(3) retain their structure, the spin states decouple and
no ESR-STM effect, hence some additional modulation
of the tunnel barrier is needed [19].

Then, we keep considering the simple Hamiltonian (2)
for the molecule and we proceed to introduce the main
feature of our model. Namely, a direct tunneling between
the tip and substrate so that the Hamiltonian (1) acquires
an additional term

In terms of the operators c′
kα,σ previously defined, HT S
involves the unitary matrix U = U T U T SU S† which can
be written as a general rotation of the form U = U SOU S
with U SO = eiσz φ1/2, and U S = eiσz φ2/2eiσy θ/2e−iσz φ2/2,
where σx,y,z the Pauli matrices. We note that with θ = 0
the spin states decouple, hence θ 6= 0 is essential for
the ESR effect. In terms of the unitary transformation
kT,σ = Pσ′ U S
c′′
kS,σ′ the direct T S coupling becomes
spin diagonal with the matrix U SO while HM,S becomes
off diagonal with U S. The phase φ2 can be eliminated by
defining dσ = eiσφ2/2 dσ, c′
kS,σ =
eiσφ2/2ckS,σ. The different Hamiltonian terms become

while the HT , HS terms of (1) remain unchanged with
the ckα,σ, dσ operators.

For this model, the charge current operator flowing
into the tip reads JT (t) = JM→T (t) + JS→T (t), where
the first term corresponds to the current flowing through
the molecule, while the second one is due to the di-
rect tunneling W . We expect the T-M capacitance
to be smaller than the M-S one [23], hence the cir-
cuit current [24] is dominated by the tip current JT .
The corresponding noise spectrum can be decomposed
as S(t, ω) = SM (t, ω) + SW (t, ω). The first term corre-
sponds to current-current correlation functions involving
current operators through the molecule, while the sec-
ond one corresponds to those due to the direct current
between tip and substrate,

SM (t, ω) = Z +∞

In what follows we focus on the first term, which con-
tains the relevant information involving the scattering
processes through the molecule. The second one repre-
sents a background signal, which is usually subtracted
from the experimental data. The current is induced by
applying a dc bias voltage V , which relates the chemical
potentials of the tip and substrate as µT = µS + eV . In
this stationary case Sl(t, ω) ≡ Sl(ω), l = W, M .

Consider now the experimentally relevant parameters.
The DC current I = h JT i ∼ 0.1 − 1nA for V ≈ 1V
[1].
In our model we find that the Larmor frequency
appears in the noise when W ≫ w, hence the DC con-
ductance is dominated by the W term. The latter is [25]

the tip and substrate density of states, taken as con-
stants in the (µT , µS) range. Assuming NT,S ∼ 1/b,
where b is the bandwidth of these reservoirs, we estimate
W/b ≈ 10−3 corresponding to a weak tunneling regime
with x ≪ 1. The resonance is sharp, with a width of
[1] ∆ω/2π ≈ 1MHz, much smaller than the resonance
frequency, typically ωz/2π ≈ 500MHz. A golden rule es-
timate, consistent with our data for small w, W , gives a
resonance width ∆ω = 2πw2/b. The ensuing estimate for
the DC current via the molecule is hJM→T i = 2e∆ω/2π.
The ∆ω value above yields ∼ 10−12A, verifying that the
DC current is indeed dominated by the direct conduc-
tance GW . Considering b ≈ 5eV we estimate w/b ≈
10−5. We note that the experiments were at room tem-
perature, T ≫ ωz, hence the linewidth is not sensitive
to temperature. We assume that the chemical potential
of the substrate µS = 0 lies between the two levels. Our
results depend weakly on the position of these levels, as
long as at least one of them is in between µS and µR.

We now show results for the noise spectrum in our

3

model. We have calculated SM (ω) and ST (ω) following
the procedure of Ref. 26. We use θ = π and φ1 = π/2 to
maximize the resonance effect, (the value of φ1 is irrel-
evant to the resonance effect). We chose W, w, T, eV, ǫ±
not too far from the experimental estimates (in eV units).
Both reservoirs are modeled as semi-infinite 1D chains
with bandwidth b so that x = (4W/b)2.

Fig. 1a shows the onset of the Larmor frequency in the
noise SM as the direct coupling W is turned on. We have
studied the effect of w on this resonance and extended
the model to different tunneling coupling to the tip and
substrate wS and wT , respectively. We found that the
the width (as expected above for wT = wS) as well as
the amplitude scale as wSwT . In Fig. 1b we show the
amplitude of the signal as a function of x, the background
noise and the classical shot noise 2eI. The background
noise is taken as the mean in the range ωz ± 0.1ωz, where
the noise varies by less than 1%. We note that for x ≪
1 or x ≫ 1 the background is the classical shot noise
SW + SM ≈ 2eI. The current ratio is hJM→T i/hJS→T i ≈
4πw2/(bxeV ) (for x ≪ 1) which for the parameters of
Fig. 1b is ≈ 10−4/x. Hence at x < 10−4 the current,
as well as the background noise, is dominated by that
via the molecule and becomes x independent. The case
x = 1 corresponds to perfect ballistic matching between
the reservoirs, accounting for the maxima in the figure.
Fig. 1b shows that the signal intensity at x ≪ 1 is
linear with x, same as SW ∼ GW ∼ x. The signal to
background ratio at x = 0.01 is ∼ 10−3. Scaling to w =
5 · 10−5 reduces this ratio to ∼ 10−8. For this w the
background is SW dominates, hence the ratio above is x
independent and applies to the experimental situation.

The temperature dependence is shown in Fig. 2. The
resonance itself is not sensitive to temperature (see Fig.
2b), consistent with the experimental data [1]. In the case
of T = 0 there are features of the noise spectrum (steps)
at the frequencies corresponding to the molecular levels
ε±, which are typical of the noise spectrum of two-level
systems [28]. These features are washed up by thermal
fluctuations as soon as T > ωz. The dip at ω = 0 is
similar to the one seen in Ref. 28, with the latter due to
charge conservation at the molecule.

In Fig. 3a we show the noise in presence of an ad-
ditional ac magnetic field perpendicularly applied with
respect to B, B⊥(t) = ∆⊥ cos(Ω0t)σ1 that induces tran-
sitions between the molecule levels. For the isolated
molecule the transition amplitude at time t is

are: W = 0.1 and those in Fig. 1a. The curves below the top
one in (a) and (b) are displaced in height for clarity.

In the present case, we resort to the non-equilibrium
Green function formalism of Refs. 27 to evaluate this
function. Fig. 3a shows splitting of the line into three
signals located at Ω0 and Ω0 ± a. The amplitudes of the
signals increase as the satellite peaks become closer to
ωz. In usual ESR one usually observes the average spin
with a resonance at ωz while the amplitude of the Rabi
frequency a decays by a T2 process. The analog of our
current correlation is, however, the spin-spin correlation
in ESR. The latter is in fact related to light scattering
from a 2-level system showing a "Mollow triplet" [29, 30].
In Fig. 3b we show the noise in presence of an ac mag-
netic field parallel to B, Bk(t) = ∆k cos(Ω0t)σz which
produces an oscillation in the energy levels around their
equilibrium values with amplitude ∆k and frequency Ω0.
In this case, the time evolution of the off diagonal σ1

where Jn(x) are the Bessel functions. For ∆k ≪ Ω0 only
the first terms of the series with n = 0, ±1 contribute be-
ing the term with n = 0 with J0(0) = 1 the dominant one.
Thus, in remarkable contrast with the case of a perpen-
dicular ac field, the strongest noise signal appears at ωz
with two sizable satellites at ωz ± Ω0. This is illustrated
in Fig. 3b, where the main peak and the right satellite
are shown for several values of Ω0; the inset zooms on the
weaker second order order satellite at ωz + 2Ω0. A case
with many sidebands was in fact studied by ERS-STM
[5] and is consistent with Eq. (10). It is remarkable that
these well known features from ESR are reproduced in
the current noise spectra.

Discussion: Our model assumes that the spin-orbit in-
teraction is significant, for at least one of the tunneling
terms. We note that the strong electric field near the tip
can enhance the spin-orbit coupling in the molecule. We
consider now several unusual features of the data that
our model can account for: (i) A sharp resonance even
at high temperatures T ≫ ωz, (ii) insensitivity to the
details of the spin defect, i.e. to the positions of its levels
between the tip and substrate chemical potentials, (iii)
contour plots [3, 4] showing that the signal is maximal at
∼ 1nm from a center, hence a significant direct coupling
W bypassing the spin can be achieved. (iv) We account
for the ESR-STM phenomenon with unpolarized tip or
substrate, in contrast with previous models [14, 15] that
require polarized leads.

We note that the background noise is not measured in
the experiment since the modulation technique [1] mea-
sures the derivative of the noise spectra. Furthermore,
the signal intensity is under study [12] as it is highly
sensitive to uncertainties in the feedback and impedance
matching circuits. We estimate that the signal to back-
ground intensity is ∼ 10−8 as discussed above. Further-
more, we predict the appearance of triplet lines when
adding a time dependent field perpendicular to the DC
one. The spacing of these lines is determined by the Rabi
frequency. We also predict multiple sidebands for modu-
lation with parallel field, partly seen in experiment [5]. In
conclusion, our model presents a solution to a long stand-
ing puzzle, paving the way for more controlled single spin
detection via ESR-STM.
