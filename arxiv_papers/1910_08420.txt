In this article we analyze the efficiency of operations based on transferring charge from a quantum
dot (QD) to two coupled topological superconductors, which can be used for performing nonabelian
operations on Majorana bound states (MBSs). We develop a method which allows us to describe the
full time-evolution of the system as the QD energy is manipulated. Using a full counting statistics
analysis, we set bounds to the operation time scales. The lower bound depends on the supercon-
ducting phase difference due to a partial decoupling of the different MBSs parity sectors, while the
upper bound is set by the tunneling of quasiparticles to the MBSs. Using realistic parameters, we
find the existence of a regime where the operation can be carried out with a fidelity close to unity.
Finally, we propose the use of a two operations protocol to quantify the effect of the dephasing
and accumulated dynamical phases, demonstrating their absence for certain superconducting phase
differences.

INTRODUCTION

Prediction of the existence of Majorana bound states
(MBSs) at the ends of a topological superconductor (TS)
has given hope of observing nonabelian statistics (for re-
cent reviews see [1 -- 5]), which can potentially be used for
topological quantum computation [6]. Earliest evidence
of their existence were based on local probes coupled to
the ends of a TS, showing the build-up of a zero bias peak,
firstly measured in Ref.
[7]. More recently, some ex-
periments have shown additional pieces of evidence con-
sistent with the presence of MBSs in proximity-induced
superconducting devices such as the zero bias conduc-
tance quantization [8, 9], interferometry signatures [10],
exponential scaling with length in Coulomb blockaded
islands [11] and interactions between zero-energy states
and quantum dot (QD) orbitals [12].

However, an unambiguous proof of their topological
origin would rely on the demonstration of their non-
abelian statistics. Some previous theoretical proposals in
this direction were based on a spatial exchange of MBSs
in a multiterminal device [13] and others used tunnel-
ing or Coulomb blockade to manipulate the ground state
manifolds [14 -- 16]. Alternatively, signatures of the pre-
dicted nonabelian statistics can emerge after a sequence
of manipulations of the quantum state of a set of MBSs,
using charge-transfer based operations of QDs coupled to
TSs [17]. The dependence of the final state on the order
in which the operations are performed would reveal the
nonabelian nature of MBSs.

In this work, we analyze the efficiency of the charge-
transfer operation of a QD coupled to two TS electrodes
[17], schematically represented in Figs. 1 a) and b). Dur-
ing the operation, the QD level energy is swept from neg-
ative to positive energies well outside the superconduct-
ing gap, as illustrated in Fig. 1 c). As a consequence, the
electron initially residing in the QD is transferred to the
TSs. In a successful operation the QD empties into the

MBSs (solid arrows in Fig. 1 d)). As an example, starting
from an initial pL, pR(cid:105)i = 1,−1(cid:105) state (where ±1 means
even/odd MBS parity of one of the leads), it evolves to a
superposition between 1, 1(cid:105) and −1,−1(cid:105) after a success-
ful operation, with weights proportional to the tunneling
amplitudes to the right and left TSs, respectively, and
a relative phase given by the superconducting phase dif-
ference. Differently from Ref.
[17], we consider the full
time dynamics of the system, taking also into account the
degrees of freedom from the continuum of states. This
allows us to analyze various sources of errors such as the
non-adiabatic effects, which can make the QD charge re-
lax (dashed arrows in Fig. 1 d)), and the role of excited
quasiparticles above the superconducting gap, which can
produce undesired parity changes.

In order to analyze the change in the MBSs parity,

we use a full counting statistics formalism which allows
us to keep track of the transferred electrons in the junc-
tion. For experimentally accessible temperatures, we find
an optimal manipulation rate window where operations
can be performed with high fidelity. We propose a pro-
tocol based on 2 charge transfer operations, where the
QD level returns back to its original value at the final
time, as a way of quantifying the influence of dephasing
and accumulated dynamical phases. Deviations between
the initial and final states provides a measurement of the
effect of the different sources of errors.

The second term contains information about the hopping

represents the inverse QD Green function in
the Keldysh-Nambu space [19 -- 21] and Σ the tunneling

contributions, Σ = ΣM + Σc, describing the coupling to
the MBSs and the continuum of states, respectively (ex-
pressions are given in the supplementary information (SI)
[22]). For simplicity, we consider a sudden connection be-
tween the QD and the electrodes at t = 0, such that the
charge state of the QD and the parity state of the elec-
trodes are initially well defined. We have checked that
the connection process does not affect to the initial parity
state of the MBSs for an initial level position i (cid:29) ∆.
The problem is solved in the time domain by discretiz-
ing the Keldysh contour and numerically inverting Eq.

tem can be extracted from the QD NEGFs. For in-
stance, the average parity of each MBS can be obtained

In contrast, from the mean values obtained from the
NEGFs of Eq. (3) it is not possible to extract the prob-
ability of a successful operation. This information can
instead be obtained by projecting the number of elec-
trons transferred between the QD and the MBSs using
a full counting statistics analysis. This information is

In the right panel of Fig. 2 we show the average par-
ity of the left and right MBSs for an adiabatic r value
where Pf ≈ 1 and two different superconducting phases.
As shown, for φ = π (mod 2π) (cid:104)pL(cid:105) and (cid:104)pR(cid:105) tend to
0 at long times, consistent with the convergence to the
expected final state after the operation. In contrast, for
φ (cid:54)= (2n + 1)π the average parities exhibit oscillations
during the manipulation, which leads to a dependence of
the final state on the details of the operation. These os-
cillations are due to the breaking of degeneracy between
the even and odd parity states of the non-local fermion
formed by the left and the right MBSs, as shown in the SI
[22]. For φ = (2n + 1)π + δφ the period of the oscillations

This illustrates the importance of having an accurate
control on the superconducting phase difference. Addi-
tional oscillations are observed after the operation (for
0 (cid:29) ∆) with a period given by 0/[4VLVR cos(φ/2)]. It
is worth commenting that the same behavior is observed
in the case the QD is coupled to the same Majorana op-
erators (either γA or γB) at the left and right side, as
considered in Ref. [17], by shifting the superconducting
phase difference value by π. In the following we will focus
on the φ = (2n + 1)π situation, where the parity oscilla-
tions are absent and Pf quantifies the success probability
of the charge-transfer operation.

The analysis performed above would indicate that the
choice of slower rates tends to improve the success proba-
bility. However, some additional processes can affect the
operation fidelity for adiabatic rates, such as the decay-
ing of excited quasiparticles into the MBSs, which lead
to uncontrolled parity changes. First estimations have
shown that these events happen in the ms time scale in a
trivial wire, i.e. without MBSs [23]. Processes involving
the decaying of quasiparticles directly into the MBSs will
be disregarded in the following. Instead we consider the
time-scales for quasiparticles tunneling between the con-

rate as a function of the superconducting phase for different
Pf values. Right panel: average parity of left and right MBSs
during an operation with r = ∆2/4. We consider two different
phases: φ = π/2 (solid lines) and φ = π (dotted lines). In
both cases we take ΓL = ΓR = 0.15∆ and temperature T = 0.

The probability of a change of the joint MBS parity is
described by the generating function as P (t) = [1−Z(χ =
π, t)]/2, which is also the probability for the QD charge
to be transferred to the MBSs. P saturates for 0(t) ∼
10Γ to a value Pf , leading to a total operation time t ≈
20 Γ/r.

III. RESULTS

In this section we analyze the success probability of the
charge-transfer based operation on the system sketched
in Figs. 1 a) and b). We consider an initially well-defined
MBS parity on both sides, choosing without loss of gener-
ality pL, pR(cid:105)i = 1,−1(cid:105) as the initial MBS parity state.
A successful operation in which the QD charge is effi-
ciently transferred to the MBSs (solid arrows in Fig. 1 d))
leads to a change of the total MBS parity state (from odd
to even in our case), leading to a final state pL, pR(cid:105)f =
R. As dis-

cussed below, this is only true for φ = (2n + 1)π.

In the left panel of Fig. 2 we show the dependence of
the inverse manipulation rate (1/r) on the superconduct-
ing phase difference for different values of Pf . As shown,
the rate needed for a given Pf depends strongly on φ,
becoming optimal (thus, minimizing operation times) for
φ = (2n + 1)π. At φ = 2nπ the time of the operation
diverges due to the formation of a dark state preserving
the total MBS parity state for VL = VR and for any 0

value, setting a limit Pf = 0.5 for adiabatic operations.
The dark state is given by (1,−1(cid:105) + i−1, 1(cid:105))/
√
2 for the
odd MBS parity sector and (1, 1(cid:105)+i−1,−1(cid:105))/
2 for the
even one. For VL (cid:54)= VR the even and odd MBS parity
sectors are no longer decoupled, although the value of r
needed for reaching a Pf close to unity becomes strongly
dependent on the asymmetry between the left and right

ing the parity of the MBSs, they do not contain informa-
tion about dephasing or the accumulation of dynamical
phases. These effects can be generated by high order
processes involving the tunneling of electrons between
the QD and the continuum of states. In order to quan-
tify the dephasing, we suggest two charge-transfer oper-
ations, where the QD level energy is swept from i to
f and then back to i. The results of this protocol are
shown in Fig. 4 for a situation where a high Pf is ob-
served in the right panel of Fig. 3 (solid lines). In the top
panel of Fig. 4 we show the change of the joint MBS par-
ity, which evolves to almost 1 after the first manipulation
and returns back to almost 0 when the QD level energy
returns to its original value (solid line). The lower panel
of Fig. 4 shows the average parity values of the left and
right MBS pairs during the operation, confirming that
the parity of each electrode returns back to its original
value after the second operation (solid lines). We have
also verified that the final state of the electrodes does
not degrade if different adiabatic rates are considered for
the two manipulation processes, indicating the absence
of uncontrolled dynamical phases for φ = π (mod 2π).

The dashed lines in Fig.

4 illustrate the effect of
an accumulation of uncontrolled phase factors after the
first operation, which we simulate using a randomly dis-
tributed phase ξ in a given interval. Therefore, the state
after a successful first operation is ∝ (VReiφR/2 1, 1(cid:105) +
VLei(φL/2+ξ) −1,−1(cid:105)). This is analyzed using the low
energy model described in Eq. (2), which accurately de-
scribes the system adiabatic evolution. While the to-
tal MBS parity change is not affected by the inclusion
of randomly distributed phase ξ (top panel of Fig. 4),
the individual parities of the electrodes do not return
back to their original values. Instead, they they approach
(cid:104)pν(cid:105) = 0 in the limit the introduced phase factor is com-
pletely random. Therefore, the difference between the
initial and final parity states, δ((cid:104)pν(cid:105)) = (cid:104)pν(cid:105)f − (cid:104)pν(cid:105)i,
quantifies the accumulated error in the whole process.
The error on a single manipulation can be estimated as

1 −(cid:112)1 − δ((cid:104)pν(cid:105)) in the regime where no other errors

occur between the first and the second operation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the efficiency of the charge-transfer
based operations of a QD coupled to two topological su-
perconductors, setting bounds to its optimal time scales.
We have found the optimal parameters where the final
state after an adiabatic operation does not depend on
the details of how it is performed. We have also analyzed
the effects of imperfections in the system that affect the
adiabatic operations, studying the effect of the excited
quasiparticles above the superconducting gap at finite
temperature, which leads to a lower bound to the ma-
nipulation rate. In the SI [22] we furthermore investigate
the effects of an overlap between the MBS wavefunctions
within a wire. We show that this leads to an upper bound

tinuum and the MBSs mediated by the QD during the
charge-transfer based operation which, as it turns out,
can be much shorter, see Fig. 3. At a finite T , there is
a density of quasiparticles excited above the supercon-
ducting gap. For small T , the number of quasiparticles
is exponentially suppressed and the manipulation can be
performed with a high success probability, as illustrated
by the blue curves in the left panel of Fig. 3. However,
when the temperature increases, Pf drops for adiabatic
rates. This is better illustrated in the right panel of Fig.
3 where we show that Pf exhibits a maximum, decreas-
ing for small r values, due to the tunneling of thermally
excited quasiparticles to the QD.

For small temperatures (T <∼ 0.2∆), the system ex-
hibits a range of r values where Pf is close to unity. We
observe that the decay point of Pf for decreasing r val-
ues scales linearly with the density of thermally excited
quasiparticles. It allows us to estimate an optimal win-
dow for the rate using experimentally relevant parame-
ters where kBT /∆ ∼ 0.1, finding r/∆Γ ∼ 10−4 − 10−1.
This leads to an estimated manipulation time scale of
the order of 0.1 µs to 0.1 ns for VL and VR smaller but
of the same order of magnitude as ∆. The upper bound
has been estimated considering an equilibrium distribu-
tion of excited quasiparticles with energies larger than
the superconducting gap. It can be significantly reduced
if a higher density of these quasiparticles is found in the
TSs.

OPERATIONS ON MAJORANA SYSTEMS"

Appendix A: Green functions formalism

6

In this section of the supplementary information (SI) the main theoretical tools are introduced, summarizing the
most important expressions describing the system time evolution. We employ a Green functions formalism on the
Keldysh-Nambu contour. In this framework, the inverse QD Green function is given by Eq. (3) of the main text. In
order to describe the time dynamics, the Keldysh contour is discretized in time with a time step, δt, smaller than any
other inverse energy (see Fig. 5). The expression for the bare inverse QD Green function on the discretized Keldysh
contour is given by

FIG. 5. Keldysh contour considered to analyze the transient regime. χ indicates the counting field changing sign on the two
branches of the contour and δt corresponds to the time step in the discretized calculation of the generating function Z(χ, t).

In order to integrate Eq. (A5) we use the property 1/(ω ± iη) = ∓iπδ(ω) + PV(1/ω), which divides the self-energy
into two contributions. The first one, involving the Dirac-delta functional, describes the tunneling between the QD
and the MBSs (ΣM BS). The second part, which is related to the integral of the principal value, contains information
about the continuum degrees of freedom (Σc). The total self-energy is then given by

Appendix B: Full counting statistics

The full counting statistics (FCS) method, which analyzes the statistics of the transferred electrons, is an ideal tool
for extracting the probability of successful manipulation. This information is absent in the QD Green functions, given
in Eq. (3) of the main text. While FCS has traditionally been used to investigate the charge and current fluctuations
of nanojunctions, in this section we extend this formalism for addressing the parity change of a topological system.
The number of electrons transferred are determined using a counting variable χ, which enters as phase factors in the
tunneling amplitudes, changing sign in the Keldysh contour as indicated in Fig. 5. The main ingredient in the theory
is the so-called generating function (GF)

Z(χ, t) =

Pn(t)ei n χ ,

(cid:88)

corresponds to taking χ = π. In this particular case, the GF is given by Z(χ, t) =(cid:80)

which encodes the probability distribution of transferred charges until time t, Pn(t). An interesting particular case
Pn(t)(−1)n, which describes

n

the probability of a parity change (transfer of an odd number of electrons).

8

To analyze the parity change of the subgap states, we will include the counting variable only in the MBS self-energies

(A8) as

¯ΣM ;ν(χ) = eiτ K

z (τz+τ0)χν /2ΣM ;νeiτ K

z (τz+τ0)χν /2 ,

(B2)

where τ K
is the Pauli matrix acting in the Keldysh space and χν the counting field variable for each electrode. The
z
counting field in Eq. (B2) only projects the first Nambu component, which is sufficient to determine the system state.
There are two different choices for the counting field at both sides of the junction. The first possibility, which is
used in the main text, corresponds to taking χL = χR = χ/2. This situation corresponds to projecting the system
wavefunction onto a state with well defined joint parity of left and right MBSs. Alternatively, the counting field
variable can be set to zero on on side and to χ on the other one. This situation corresponds to the projection of the
state of one TS onto a state with well defined parity for χ = π. In this case, however, the charge-transfer operation
is affected by the measurement process, since an instantaneous projection of the state on one side will set the MBS
parity either to even or odd, avoiding the formation of quantum superpositions. As an example, this choice will
prevent the system from returning back to its original state after the protocol described in Fig. 4 of the main text.

Independently from the choice of counting field, the GF in the discrete time mesh can be computed as

det(cid:2)g−1
0 − Σ(χ)(cid:3)
0 − Σ(χ = 0)(cid:3) .
det(cid:2)g−1

Z(χ, t) =

mulants by taking successive derivatives of the GF as (cid:104)ck(t)(cid:105) = ∂k/∂(iχ)k Log[Z(χ, t)]χ=0 and(cid:10)I k(t)(cid:11) = ∂/∂t (cid:104)ck(t)(cid:105),

Finally, it is worth commenting that the same expression can be used to compute the transferred charge and current cu-
for χL = −χR = χ/2.

Appendix C: MBS parity oscillations

The charge-transfer based operations are not protected by topology. Therefore, they can suffer from decoherence
and processes affecting the MBSs parity. This is the case for the parity oscillations shown in the right panel of Fig.
2 of the main text. They occur for any superconducting phase difference, except for φ = π (mod 2π), where the final
state after an adiabatic operation at zero temperature does not depend on how it is performed. In this section of the
SI we analyze the absence of parity oscillations at this particular phase, discussing the effect of small deviations from
φ = π (mod 2π). In the following we will consider an adiabatic operation and focus on the zero temperature case, i.e.
no excited quasiparticles above the superconducting gap.

We consider the effective Hamiltonian

where T is the time ordering operator. The different terms in the right hand side of Eq. (C6) describe all the possible
tunneling events between the QD and the TSs. The linear term in HT describes the process in which the QD charge
state is transferred to the TSs during the charge-transfer based operation, while higher order terms describe undesired
effects such as the MBS parity oscillations shown in Fig. 2 of the main text. At second order in Eq. (C6), the only
terms affecting the MBS parities are the ones involving the transfer of an electron between the left and right MBSs.

(cid:105)(cid:27)

These processes give as a consequence an electron transferred from the left to the right TS, changing the MBS parity
at both sides of the junction. For a phase difference φ = π (mod 2π), the two contributions in Eq. (C7) cancel
each other, negating the undesired parity changes between the MBSs. A similar cancellation can be found for the
remaining second order terms affecting the MBSs parity state. In a similar way, for any higher order term in HT,M BS
in Eq. (C6), there is always another one of the same order cancelling its contribution for φ = π (mod 2π).

At zero temperature, the continuum of states outside the superconducting gap start to contribute to the MBS parity
at fourth order in HT in Eq. (C6). It describes processes where electrons (or holes) coming from the continuum of
states can tunnel to the MBSs, mediated by the QD. Two of these processes leading to the same final state are
described by

(C8)

which cancel each other for φ = π (mod 2π). It can be demonstrated that, for any other higher order term affecting
the MBSs parity state, there exists another one of the same order cancelling it for this phase difference. It implies
that the states above the superconducting gap do not induce changes on the MBSs parity state at T = 0 for φ = π
(mod 2π). Therefore, the main errors occurring during the operation for these parameters are due to non-adiabatic
effects. We note that dephasing is not important in the analyzed parameter regime, as shown in Fig. 4.
For φ (cid:54)= (2n + 1)π, the higher order contributions in HT in Eq. (C6) do not cancel. They give rise to a time
oscillation of the MBSs parity as shown in Fig. 2 of the main text, leading to an oscillating current [26] in time, due
to the breaking of degeneracy between the even and odd parity states of the non-local fermion formed by γA
L and γB
R .
Because of these oscillations, the final state depends on the details of the operation (such as sweep rate), even in the
adiabatic limit. Also, they can lead to a result similar to the fully dephased situation when the QD energy is not
far enough above the superconducting gap, if the characteristic measurement time on MBS parity is larger than the
oscillation period.

time scales given by(cid:112)2

Slightly away from the ideal condition, φ = (2n+1)π +δφ, the higher order terms in the expansion of Eq. (C6) start
to contribute. In order to minimize their contribution, the manipulation time should be faster than their characteristic
R)/(4VLVRδφ) for δφ (cid:28) 1. It defines an upper limit for the operation time scale,

0 + 4(V 2

L + V 2

illustrating the importance of accurately control the phase difference between the TSs.

Finally, it is worth commenting that this demonstration is based on several assumptions. Firstly, we have assumed
that the electrons tunneling from a given lead have a well-defined phase. Additionally, the demonstration is based
on the assumption that adding and removing electrons from the MBSs lead to the same final state, as there is no
charging energy in the TSs. Therefore, it is important that superconductors are grounded. Furthermore, a coupling
between the MBSs in the same TS, lifting the even-odd ground state degeneracy, can be detrimental for the charge-
based operations, as shown in the next section using a simplified version of the effective Hamiltonian (D1). Finally,
a non-zero temperature or a non-adiabatic operation can induce errors during the QD manipulation, as discussed in
the main text.

manipulation. Results are showed for an asymmetric coupling between MBSs in the left and right lead, ηL = VL/10, ηR = ηL/2
and δη = ηL − ηR. The remaining parameters are VL = VR and φ = π.

Appendix D: Low energy model: overlap between MBSs.

In this section, we introduce a simplified model that includes only the low energy degrees of freedom. It disregards

the electronic degrees of freedom outside the superconducting gap. The low energy Hamiltonian is given by

is described by Eq. (C4). Finally, Ho,M BS =(cid:80)

(D1)
where HQD = 0(t)d†d with 0(t) the time-dependent energy level and the tunneling between the MBSs and the dot
ν describes the overlap between MBSs at the same wire.
Using the low energy Hamiltonian of Eq. (D1), the time evolution of a given initial state, Ψ(0)(cid:105), is described by

HLEM = HQD + HT,M BS + Ho,M BS ,

ν=L,R ηνγA

ν γB

unitary evolution as

Ψ(t + δt)(cid:105) = exp (−iHLEM δt)Ψ(t)(cid:105) ,

(D2)

where δt has to be taken much smaller than the smallest inverse energy in the model to ensure convergence. The
simplified model provided in Eq. (D1) correctly describes the time evolution of the system for adiabatic manipulations,
as shown in the top panel of Fig. 4 of the main text. However, it does not describe the effect of thermally excited
quasiparticles in the TSs and the relaxation of QD charge to the continuum of states for non-adiabatic manipulations.
In agreement with the full calculation, for VL = VR, φL − φR = 2nπ and ην (cid:54)= 0, the Hamiltonian of Eq. (D1)
describes the existence of dark states partially decoupling subspaces with different total MBS parity states. They are
given by (1, 1(cid:105) − i−1,−1(cid:105))/
2 for the even and odd MBS parities respectively. These
states are decoupled from each other, limiting the success probability to P = 1/2 for an initial state with a well defined
MBS parity at both sides of the junction. In a more general situation with φL − φR (cid:54)= 2nπ, the probability can reach
values close to unity. However, the manipulation time depends strongly on the superconducting phase difference, as
shown in the right panel of Fig. 2 of the main text.

The model in Eq. (D1) allows us to easily incorporate the coupling between MBSs in the same wire, which lifts
their ground state degeneracy. For ηL = ηR and starting from the ground state of the two TSs, an adiabatic QD
level manipulation also leads to a coherent superposition between even and odd MBS parity states for each electrode.
In contrast, for ηL (cid:54)= ηR an adiabatic manipulation leads to a convergence to the global ground state of the system,
as illustrated by the blue lines in Fig. C.6. Therefore, 1/δη defines a lower bound for the manipulation rate, with
δη = ηL − ηR.

Another question of interest that can be analyzed using the model of Eq. (D1) is related to the signatures of the
quantum state degradation. This is analyzed in Fig. C.7, where we consider an adiabatic evolution of the QD from
negative to positive energies, returning back to its original value at long times. Given 1,−1(cid:105)i as the initial state for

VReiφR/2 1, 1(cid:105) for an adiabatic manipulation. To simulate the effect from decoherence, we include a random phase
factor in one of the terms. The state before the second manipulation is thus given by ∝ VLe−iφL/2 −1,−1(cid:105) +
VRei(φR/2+ξ) 1, 1(cid:105). The phase factor ξ is taken as a random variable with all the values equally distributed within
an interval. The result for different ranges of ξ is shown in Fig. C.7 (in the lower panel of Fig. 4 of the main text
we have taken ξ ∈ [−π/2, π/2]), demonstrating the convergence to (cid:104)pν(cid:105) = 0 for a case where the system coherence is
completely lost in the process.
