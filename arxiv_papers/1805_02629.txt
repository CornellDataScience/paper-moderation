We study entanglement dynamics in the nearest-neighbour fermionic chain that is subjected to
both DC and AC electric fields. The dynamics gives the well known Bloch oscillations in the DC
field case provided that the system size is larger than the Bloch length whereas in the AC field
case the entropy is bounded and oscillates with the driving frequency at the points of dynamic
localization, and has a logarithmic growth at other points. A combined AC + DC field yields super
Bloch oscillations for the system size larger than the super Bloch length which puts a constraint
on the device size in a typical non-equilibrium set-up to observe super Bloch oscillations where the
device is connected to the leads. Entanglement entropy provides useful signatures for all of these
phenomena, and an alternate way to capture the various length scales involved.

INTRODUCTION

A charged particle under the influence of a static elec-
tric field would be expected to undergo accelerated mo-
tion towards infinity. However, in the presence of a pe-
riodic lattice potential and electric field the motion of
a quantum particle is oscillatory. These oscillations are
known as Bloch oscillations [1 -- 4]. The time period of
these oscillations is inversely proportional to the field
strength. Although theoretically well-understood, Bloch
oscillations are hard to control experimentally in normal
crystals where lattice imperfections often wash out this
effect altogether [5]. However, the advent of semicon-
ductor super-lattices, optical lattices, and temperature-
tuned wave guides has made it possible to realize Bloch
oscillations experimentally [6 -- 10].

The study of Bloch oscillations in a tight-binding
framework gives the well known Wannier-Stark ladder as
the energies and Wannier-Stark states as the eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian [11]. These states are extended over
a length called Bloch length. Hence, to observe Bloch
oscillations, the system size must be greater than this
length [12]. Also, the equispaced energy spectrum re-
sults in recurrence of any initial state. Thus an initially
localized state will again be localized after a Bloch pe-
riod.
By making the electric field time dependent: F(t) =
A cos ωt, with time period T = 2π/ω, one would expect
that the same periodicity can be seen in the dynamics.
However contrary to this expectation, only at certain spe-
cial ratios of the amplitude and the frequency of the drive
the periodicity can be seen. This phenomenon is called
dynamic localization [13 -- 15] and the special ratios are
the roots of Bessel function of order zero.

A more general form of the electric field, which in-
cludes both AC and DC field gives other interesting ef-
fects such as coherent destruction of Wannier-Stark lo-
calization [16, 17], which occurs when the DC field is

resonantly tuned with the AC drive, and super Bloch os-
cillations [18 -- 20] which occurs for slight detuning from
the resonant drive. The time period of these oscillations
is very large in comparison to Bloch oscillations. Similar
to the static field case, a super Bloch length [21, 22] is as-
sociated with the super Bloch oscillations and in order to
observe these oscillations the system size must be greater
than this length.

Entanglement [23 -- 25] quantifies the quantum correla-
tions in a state between two parts of a system.
In re-
cent times, it has emerged as a unique tool to capture a
vast variety of phenomena ranging from quantum phase
transitions [26 -- 28],
localization/de-localization transi-
tions [29 -- 33], trivial to topological transition [34 -- 36] etc.
in closed systems to the correlations between a quantum
dot and the baths in open quantum systems [37, 38].

The entanglement in a Wannier-Stark ladder [39] and
various types of quench dynamics has been studied be-
fore, both numerically [40, 41], and using CFT calcula-
tions [42]. However, the connection to various phenom-
ena associated with electric field was not made explic-
itly. From the time evolution of an initially half filled
state where all the particles are filled in the left half of
the chain, we find the appearance of Bloch oscillations
and super Bloch oscillations in the entropy dynamics
when the system size is larger than the respective length
scales: Bloch length and super Bloch length. Hence, a
device length greater than the super Bloch length is re-
quired if one has to observe super Bloch oscillations in a
non-equilibrium set-up where the device is connected to
metallic leads fixed at different chemical potentials and
temperatures. Also, oscillatory behaviour of the entropy
is observed at the dynamically localized point whereas a
logarithmic growth in entropy is seen for the situations
where a resonant drive destroys the Wannier-Stark local-
ization.

To the best of our knowledge, the extraction of the var-
ious length scales that arise in the dynamics of a tight-
binding chain subjected to electric field, from a study of
entanglement is being reported for the first time in this
paper. Furthermore, well-known associated phenomena
like Bloch oscillations, dynamic localization, coherent de-

struction of Wannier-Stark localization and super-Bloch
oscillations are viewed from an entanglement perspective.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In the next
section, we describe the model Hamiltonian with a gen-
eral time-dependent field. The subsections present the
different forms of the field and the associated phenom-
ena. The following section provides the quench protocol
and the entanglement dynamics with numerical results.
The summary and conclusions are given in the last sec-
tion.

finite system of size 2L sites with electric field is

where F(t) is the electric field and a is the lattice pa-
rameter. The numerical work is done in units where
 = 1, c = 1, e = 1, J = 1, a = 1 (unless otherwise
stated). For a constant electric field F(t) = F , the dy-
namics gives the well known Bloch oscillations, while
a sinusoidal driving F(t) = A cos ωt can give rise to
dynamic localization when A and ω are tuned appro-
priately.
In the presence of a combined AC+DC field
F(t) = F + A cos ωt, the phenomenon of coherent de-
struction of Wannier-Stark localization is seen at reso-
nance whereas a slight detuning from the resonant con-
dition yields super Bloch oscillations.

A. Bloch Oscillations

For F(t) = F , the exact eigenstates in the n → ∞

limit are the Wannier-Stark states:

Ψm(cid:105) =

Jn−m (2J/aF )n(cid:105).

(2)

m

The single particle energies form a ladder with equal
spacing Em = maF , where m = 0,±1,±2, ..... However,
for finite system sizes one observes non-linear behaviour
at the ends of the spectrum - these end effects are dimin-
ished on increasing system size.

A natural length scale of the problem is the Bloch

length [11]

LB =

4J
F

.

(3)

One can observe Bloch oscillations with the frequency
ωB = aF/ in the dynamics if the system size is greater
than the Bloch length. This can be easily seen by study-
ing the time evolution of the mean square single particle
width

σ2(t) = (cid:104)n2(t)(cid:105) − (cid:104)n(t)(cid:105)2,

FIG. 1. Mean square single particle width of the wave-packet
at t = 5TB (top) and t = 2TSB (bottom) as a function of
system size rescaled to Bloch length and super Bloch length
respectively. The transition shows the requirement of a device
size greater than Bloch length and super Bloch length to ob-
serve the oscillations.(Parameters are: A = 2.0 and ω = 1.0.)

when the initial state is a single particle localized at the
centre of the chain. Time evolution for a time equal
to an integer multiple of TB must return the system
back to where it started, if Bloch oscillations are present.
Fig. 1(a) shows the mean square width of the wave-packet
calculated for different field strengths at a time which is
an integer multiple of TB (we show data for the specific
case of 5TB), as a function of the system size rescaled
by the Bloch length. Since the initial state is a localized
state with σ2 = 0 and the same state will reappear after
a Bloch period (see appendix), the mean square width at
t = nTB should also go to zero. However, this happens
only when the system size is larger than the Bloch length.

B. Dynamic Localization

For a time dependent electric field, the solution of the
time dependent Schrodinger equation for the Hamilto-
nian H is given by the Houston states or accelerated

The dispersion E(qk) ≡ −2J cos(qka) is that of the
nearest-neigbour tight-binding model, but with implicit
time-dependence from the quasi-momentum. For a si-
nusoidal driving F(t) = A cos(ωt), the quasi-momentum
is

qk(t) = k +

sin(ωt).

(7)

Although the quasi momentum qk(t) is periodic in time
with period T = 2π/ω, the Houston states however are
not T -periodic due to an extra contribution coming from
the integral appearing in the exponential. The one cycle
average of that contribution is

The effect of the drive is thus the well-known re-
normalization of the hopping parameter. The Houston
states can now be decomposed in Floquet notation with
the quasi-energies (k) as

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

ψk(t)(cid:105) = uk(t)(cid:105) exp

− i

,

 (k)t

(9)
where uk(t)(cid:105) is T -periodic function which is obtained by
removing the extra contribution term of the exponential.
Hence, the time evolution of any initial state is given
by a periodic function uk(t) and the phase factors
exp (−i(k)t/). However, the phase can be tuned to
unity by choosing ( Aaω ) to be a zero of the Bessel func-
tion of order zero thereby collapsing the band. In such
a scenario, the initial state will reappear after time T
and a localized wave-packet remains localized. This phe-
nomenon is known as dynamic localization.

C. Coherent Destruction of Wannier-Stark

Localization and Super Bloch Oscillations

Although a static electric field destroys band formation
and leads to Wannier-Stark localization and an AC driv-
ing gives dynamic localization, a combination of these

3

two can give rise to the counter-intuitive phenomenon
of coherent destruction of Wannier-Stark localization.
At resonant tuning, the effective model is the nearest-
neigbor tight-binding model, and an initially localized
wavepacket delocalizes according to the usual mecha-
nism. When a slight detuning from resonance is imposed,
super Bloch oscillations whose frequency is determined
by the detuning are seen.
The formalism is the same as given in the previous sec-
tion, however the net force is now F(t) = F + A cos(ωt).
The quasi momentum given by

qk(t) = k + F t +

It can be seen that AC driving leads to the formation of
bands with the hopping parameter getting renormalized.
Hence under such a resonant driving the particle can de-
localize even though the static electric field is present.
However, once again at the zeros of the Bessel function
of order n, there is dynamic localization.

A slight detuning from the resonant drive gives rise to
super Bloch oscillations. The off-drive condition can be
written as

F a = (n + δ)ω.

(14)

Under this condition an initially localized wave-packet
starts oscillating with the time period TSB = 2π
δω [18, 44].
These oscillations are known as super Bloch oscillations.
Similar to the Bloch length, a super Bloch length is as-
sociated with super Bloch oscillations

LSB =

JJn( Aaω )

.

(15)

The super Bloch oscillations can be seen if the system
size is greater than this length. The same is shown in

4

entanglement measure is the von Neumann entropy.

Let ρ be the density matrix which describes the full
state of the system. The von Neumann entropy of the
any subsystem A is defined as

SA = −Tr(ρAlogρA),

(16)

where ρA is the reduced density matrix of subsystem A,
i.e. ρA = TrB(ρ) with TrB denoting the partial trace with
respect to subsystem B. When the overall state ρ is pure,
the von Neumann entropy SA is also the entanglement
entropy between A and B.

In a non-interacting quadratic fermionic system, the
von Neumann entropy can be directly computed from
the two point correlation matrix [48] of the subsystem A:
mcn(cid:105). The von Neumann entropy is given in
Cmn = (cid:104)c†
terms of the eigenvalues nα of the subsystem correlation
(cid:88)
matrix as

[− (1 − nα) ln (1 − nα) − nαln nα] .

(17)

S =

α

A generalization of the above result facilitates the study
of the dynamics of entanglement. The system is initially
prepared in the ground state of an unperturbed Hamil-
tonian and then suddenly a suitable quenching Hamil-
tonian is switched on, and the resulting time-evolution
governed by the new Hamiltonian is tracked. The time
dependent correlation matrix is then directly constructed
from the time evolution of the state. Finally, from the
time-dependent eigenvalues of the subsystem correlation
matrix, we have access to the dynamics of entanglement
entropy.

The time evolution of the initial state is given by

ψ(t)(cid:105) = e−iHt/ψ(0)(cid:105)

(18)

Cmn(t) = (cid:104)ψ(t)c†

mcnψ(t)(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψ0c†

The time dependent correlation matrix can be written as
m(t)cn(t)ψ0(cid:105), (19)
where we have switched to the Heisenberg picture. Using
†
the time evolution of fermionic operators c
j and cj, we
can simplify the expression for correlation matrix as (see
appendix)

where Ujk(t) = (cid:80)

C(t) = U†(t)C(0)U (t),

(20)
jn exp(−int/)Dnk and the ma-

n D∗

trix D diagonalizes the new Hamiltonian.

In a quenching protocol, where the final Hamiltonian
includes a static electric field, the form of the unitary
matrix U can be written as [11]

Unn(cid:48) (t) = Jn−n(cid:48)

ei(n−n(cid:48))(π−ωB t)/2−in(cid:48)ωB t,
(21)
Since, U (t) is periodic in time with the Bloch period,
the correlation matrix also follows the same periodicity.
Now, the correlation matrix can be written as

all the particles are filled on the left half of the chain. The
entropy becomes zero when the system size is larger than the
Bloch length and super Bloch length, respectively.

calculated as a function of L/LSB.

To summarize this section, we have made a review of
the phenomena of Bloch oscillations, dynamic localiza-
tion, coherent destruction of Wannier-Stark localization,
and super Bloch oscillations. We have shown how the
length scales LB and LSB can be extracted from a study
of wave-packet width. This section sets the scene for how
these phenomena may be viewed from an entanglement
perspective in the next section.

III. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY AND

QUENCH DYNAMICS

Quantum entanglement quantifies the lack of informa-
tion of any subsystem despite full knowledge of the over-
all system, and is also a measure of how one part of the
system is correlated with another part. Although vari-
ous measures of entanglement are available in the litera-
ture [37, 45 -- 47], the one that is most widely used as an

A/ω (left), whereas it is bounded and periodic when A/ω is a root of the Bessel function of zeroth order (centre)(parameters
are L = 100 and ω = 1.0). Entanglement entropy (right) for half filled localized state. For ω = 0.0, the entropy shows Bloch
oscillations, whereas for other values the entropy is bounded/unbounded depending on the ratio of A/ω. (Parameters are

which in conjunction with Eqn. 17 yields the time-
dependent entanglement entropy. For a time dependent
Hamiltonian, we discretize the time interval into tiny re-
gions where the Hamiltonian does not change apprecia-
bly, and the same procedure as above follows within the
tiny intervals. In this case, the time evolution operator
consists of a series of unitary operators.

The entanglement entropy between the two subsystems
for the Wannier-Stark problem was studied in [39]. The
contribution to the entanglement entropy comes from the
interface width which is created by the potential gradi-
ent. Also the dynamics after turning off the electric field
was studied and a logarithmic growth of the entropy was
observed. However, here we entirely focus on the dynam-
ics of the entanglement entropy after the electric field
is turned on. The entropy as a function of system size
rescaled by the Bloch length and super Bloch length at
t = 5TB and t = 3TSB respectively, are plotted in Fig. 2.
The initial state can be thought of as the ground state of
a half filled nearest neighbour tight binding chain with
a large electric field, where all the particles are localized
to the left of the chain. A transition signifies the min-
imum system size to observe Bloch oscillations and su-
per Bloch oscillations. The requirement of device length
larger than the Bloch length has been given in recent
work [12] where the device is connected to two metallic
leads in a non-equilibrium setting and a transition from
DC regime to Bloch oscillations regime is observed on
varying the device size. Our finding is that a similar re-
sult holds for the super Bloch oscillations in the presence
of a combined AC and DC field where the device size has
to be greater than the super Bloch length.

For the case of AC driving, Fig. 3(a,b) shows that the
mean square single-particle width of the wave-packet is

unbounded in time at arbitrary ratios of A/ω. In con-
trast, it remains bounded and oscillatory at the special
ratios which are the roots of the Bessel function of order
zero. The time evolution of entropy is shown in Fig. 3(c)
for various parameters. One can see the Bloch oscilla-
tions in the dynamics of entropy for ω = 0.0 and dy-
namic localization for the ratio A/ω = 2.405, which is
a root of Bessel function of order zero. For all other
cases the entropy is unbounded in time, thus signifying
de-localization. The coherent destruction of Wannier-
Stark localization is shown in Fig. 4(a) for a combined
AC and resonantly tuned AC field. The entropy keeps on
increasing for a resonantly tuned AC, even in the pres-
ence of the DC field. However again the periodicity of
the drive can be seen in the entropy at the special ratios
which are now the roots of the Bessel function of order
n (Fig. 4b). Super Bloch oscillations are observed in the
entropy dynamics for the cases of a slight detuning from
the resonant condition (Fig. 4c). The chief findings of
this section are that entanglement entropy offers a useful
alternative perspective for each of the phenomena associ-
ated with the application of a general (static or dynamic)
electric field.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

To summarize, we studied the dynamics of many body
entanglement in a nearest neighbour tight binding chain
with different forms of electric field. For the static elec-
tric field we find that the dynamics captures the well
known Bloch oscillations with the constraint that the sys-
tem size must be greater than the Bloch length. A sys-

shows a transition from a DC regime to Bloch oscilla-
tion regime. For an AC field we find that the entropy
oscillates with the driving frequency at the dynamically
localized point whereas at other points it is unbounded.
For a combined AC+DC form of the field we find that at
resonantly tuned DC field, the unboundedness of entan-
glement entropy verifies the coherent destruction of the
localization caused by DC field whereas a slight detuning
from the resonance condition leads to super Bloch oscil-
lations in the entropy dynamics. From the system size
scaling of the super Bloch oscillations, we find a transi-
tion from DC regime to super Bloch oscillations regime
which demands a minimum system size to observe super
Bloch oscillations.

Our results in a closed system suggests that if one has
to study super Bloch oscillations in an open system which
includes a set-up where a device is coupled to the metal-
lic leads, the device size has to be greater than the super

Bloch length to observe super Bloch oscillations. We be-
lieve that the same experimental set-up, as put forward
in Ref. 12 can be generalized for this purpose. Further-
more, time-dependent phenomena in a nonequilibrium
set-up have mostly been studied with a small number
of degrees of freedom (like a quantum dot for example).
Therefore, it would be interesting to build on our current
work and extend it to study non-equilibrium properties of
the nearest-neighbour chain that is subjected to a time-
dependent electric field.

Appendix A: Time evolution of any general quantum State

At t = 0, a parameter of the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed. The time evolution of the initial thermal state is now
govern by new Hamiltonian H1 as

where Ψn(t)(cid:105) can be written in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H1 as

Ψn(t)(cid:105) = e−iH1t/Ψn(cid:105) =

Φm(cid:105)e−iEmt/(cid:104)ΦmΨn(cid:105),

H1Φn(cid:105) = EnΦn(cid:105)

(cid:88)

where En are the eigenvalues of H1. Now the time evolution of the density matrix can be written as

In case of quenching from no electric field to some finite value of field F in the free Fermionic Hamiltonian, the
eigenvalues of the final Hamiltonian are given by Em = maF , where m = 0,±1,±2, .....Hence the time evolution of
density matrix can be written as

Since, exp(2πi(m(cid:48) − m)) = 1, we get

So, the density matrix is also periodic in time with the time period of Bloch oscillations.

ρ (t + TB) = ρ (t) .
