We  report  on  a  simple  method  to  fabricate  high-frequency  nanotube  mechanical  resonators 

reproducibly.  We  measure  resonance  frequencies  as  high  as  4.2  GHz  for  the  fundamental  eigenmode 

and  11  GHz  for  higher  order  eigenmodes.  The  high-frequency  resonances  are  achieved  using  short 

suspended  nanotubes  and  by  introducing  tensile  stress  in  the  nanotube.  These  devices  allow  us  to 

determine  the  coefficient  of  the  thermal  expansion  of  an  individual  nanotube, which  is  negative  and  is 

about 

1/K  at  room  temperature.  High-frequency  resonators  made  of  nanotubes  hold  promise 

for mass sensing and experiments in the quantum limit.

5107.0Mechanical  resonators  have  attracted  considerable  interest  as  ultra-sensitive  detectors  of mass  1-5  and 

force 6-8, and as macroscopic objects  can be cooled to the quantum motion limit 9-11. A key parameter in 

these experiments is the resonance frequency f0, which is often desirable to have as high as possible. For 

instance,  a  high  resonance  frequency  is  expected  to  improve  the  sensitivity  of  mass   sensing;  it  also 

makes  the  temperature  at  which  quantum  phenomena  appear  within  reach  of  standard  refrigerators . 

Flexural motion at f0 higher than 1 GHz was detected using single- and doubly-clamped microfabricated 

resonators  12,13.  Single-wall  carbon  nanotubes  have  allowed  the  fabrication  of  nanoelectromechanical 

resonators  endowed  with  excellent  properties  2-5,8,14-20,  but  the  highest  reported  resonance  frequency  is 

rather modest (below 600 MHz).  

 

In  this  Letter,  we  report  on  a  simple  and  reliable  method  to  fabricate  high-frequency  nanotube 

resonators  where  f0  can  be  as  high  as  4.2  GHz  for  the  fundamental  eigenmode  and  11  GHz  for  higher 

order  eigenmodes.  The  high-frequency  resonators  are  achieved  using  a  device  layout  in  which  the 

suspended nanotube  is  short. The  resonance  frequency  is  further  increased by  lowering  the  temperature 

T. We  attribute  the  latter  behavior  to  the  thermal  expansion  of  the metal  electrodes  (used  to  clamp  the 

nanotube), which increases the tensile stress in the nanotube upon lowering T.  

 

Nanotube  resonators were  fabricated  using  conventional  nanofabrication  techniques. Nanotubes were 

grown by  chemical  vapor deposition on  a  highly-resistive  silicon wafer  coated with  a 1 µm  thick oxide 

layer.  In  order  to  achieve  high-frequency  resonators,  care  was  taken  to  (1)  design  contact  electrodes 

with  a  short  separation  ranging  from  100  to  700  nm  and  (2)  select  straight  segments  of  nanotubes  by 

atomic  force microscopy  (AFM)  to minimize  slack  once  the  nanotube  is  suspended. We  used  electron-

beam  lithography  and  Cr/Au  evaporation  to  pattern  contact  electrodes  as  well  as  a  side-gate  electrode 

(Fig.  1a).  (For  those  devices whose  electrode  separation  is more  than  600  nm,  we  used  a  highly-doped 

Si wafer as a backgate.) The nanotubes were  suspended by etching ~250 nm of  the oxide with  fluoridic 

acid.

modulated  voltage  VFM    is  applied  to  the  device.  The  motion  is  detected  by  measuring  the  mixing 

 

current Imix.  

 

 

Figures  2a,b  show  two  mechanical  resonances  at  4.2  and  11  GHz  for  a  device  whose  contact 

electrodes  are    ~110  nm  apart.  The  motion  was  driven  and  detected  using  the  frequency  modulation 

(FM)  mixing  technique  18  (Fig.  1b).  The  resonances  consist  of  a  central  peak  flanked  by  two  lobes, 

which  is  consistent  with  the  typical  lineshape  of  a  mechanical  resonance  in  a  FM  measurement  18  (the 

observed  asymmetry  in  the  resonances  is  probably  due  to  the  Duffing  force).  The  properties  of  the 

resonator  slightly  changed  during  the  X  cool-downs  experienced  by  the  device.  That  is,  the  lower  f0 

fluctuates between 3.8 and 4.3 GHz and the higher f0 between 11 and 11.2 GHz. 

 

These  resonances  correspond  to  flexural  eigenmodes,  since  other  eigenmodes  are  expected  to  have 

much  larger  resonance  frequencies  (f0 ≈  240 GHz  for  the  lowest  longitudinal and  twisting  eigenmodes 

of a 110 nm long nanotube 21). We assign the 4.2 GHz resonance to the fundamental eigenmode, since it 

is  the  lowest  in  frequency  and  shows  the  largest  current  signal  at  resonance.  Accordingly,  the  11  GHz 

resonance corresponds to a higher-order eigenmode, which is likely the 3rd mode, since the 2nd mode is 

expected  to  be  driven  weakly  due  to  the  symmetry  of  the  device  (the  gate  electrode  is  symmetrically 

 

3 

placed  with  respect  to  the  nanotube).  The  ratio  between  the  11  and  the  4.2  GHz  frequencies  is  rather 

close  to  3,  the  value  expected  for  a  nanotube  under  tension.  One  reason  why  the  ratio  is  not  exactly  3 

could be related to the influence of the clamping electrodes (I. Wilson-Rae, private communication).  

 

We  confirmed  the  mechanical  origin  of  these  resonances  by  depositing  xenon  atoms  onto  the 

nanotube  in situ and observing a drop  in  the  resonance frequencies (Fig. 2e). The reason  for  the drop  in 

f0  is  that  Xe  atoms  adsorb  on  the  nanotube  surface  and  thus  increase  the  mass  of  the  mechanical 

resonator (these results will be  further discussed elsewhere). Another signature of  the mechanical origin 

is the strong temperature dependence of  f0 (Fig. 1e); we indeed studied dozens of mechanical resonators 

with  the FM mixing  technique and occasionally observed some  low-amplitude resonances whose origin 

was purely electrical, but whose  f0 would not change with temperature.

pinhole  doser.  (f)  Resonance  frequency  as  a  function  of  the  nanotube  length  at  4  K  for  d ifferent 

resonators. [JULIEN: Double check les valeurs de VFM] 

 

 

Figure 2d shows  that  the quality factor Q  increases upon  lowering  temperature and  is as high as 1200 

at  4  K  and  for  a  driving  excitation  VFM  =  4  mV. We  emphasize  that  the  quality  factor  varies  with  the 

driving  excitation  (Q  increases  by  a  factor  ~3  upon  increasing  VFM  from  1  to  10  mV).  It  is  not  clear 

whether this variation is due to nonlinear damping 8,20 or is related to Joule heating (which is induced by 

the large applied voltage).  

 

Two  important parameters  that  allow us  to  tune  the  resonance  to  high  frequency  are  the  length of  the 

suspended  nanotube  segment  (LNT)  and  the  temperature.  Indeed,  Fig.  2f  displays  the  resonance 

frequency  of  the  fundamental  eigenmode  at  4  K  for  the  7  resonators  that  were  fabricated  with  the 

method  described  above;  the  resonance  frequency  increases  as  LNT  decreases,  as  expected  for 

mechanical  resonators.  In  addition,  the  resonance  frequency  dramatically  increases  upon  lowering  T  as 

shown  in Fig. 2c and  in  the upper curve  in Fig. 3a. The  latter behavior  is related  to  the T dependence of 

the  tensile  stress within  the  nanotube:  in  our  device  layout  (inset  of  Fig.  3a)  the  suspended  parts  of  the 

clamping  Au  electrodes  contract  upon  lowering  T,  thus  they  increase  the  tensile  stress  within  the 

nanotube (the estimated contraction 22 of Au from 300 to 4K is  

lAu ≈ 1.6 nm and is larger than that of 

Si 23 which is 

lSi ≈ 0.2 nm in Fig. 3a). By contrast, the resonance frequency is weakly sensitive to the 

voltage applied on the gate (see supplementary information).   

 

From  the  T  dependence  of  f0,  we  evaluate  the  elongation 

l  imposed  on  the  nanotube  using  the 

relation

valids  for  a  beam  under  tensile  stress  and  using  Hooke´s  law 

  for  a 

hollow  cylinder  with  built-in  tension  T0.  Here  m=  2.6  ag  is  the  mass  of  the  nanotube,  LNT=640  nm  its 

length, r=0.85 nm its radius, and E=1.25 TPa its Young’s modulus (LNT and r were measured with AFM 

before  the nanotube  suspension).   Figure 3b  shows  that  the  elongation  and  its variation  with T  are  very 

small (of the order of 100 pm).  

 

We  are  now  in  a  position  to  estimate  the  thermal  expansion  coefficient  (TEC)  of  an  individual 

nanotube, a property that has not been measured thus far. For this, we use the definition of the TEC

together  with  the  hypothesis  of  the  conservation  of  length 

.  Figure  3c  shows  that 

the  TEC  of  the  nanotube  is  negative  and  that  its  magnitude  is  rather  large  (

1/K).  We  obtain 

similar  results  for  the  other  nanotubes  (for which  f0  could  be measured  from  300  to  4 K).  Interestingly, 

this TEC is similar to what was recently measured  in graphene 24,25 and also to the TEC estimated using 

numerical simulations on unclamped nanotubes 26.

the  lowest  resonance  of  a  nanotube  with  slack  (T0  <  0)  whose  length  is  about  1  m  (the  device  is 

fabricated  as  in  Ref.  [15]).The  upper  inset  shows  the  schematic  of  the  nanotube  resonator.  (b)

In  conclusion, we  have  reported  on  a  simple method  to  fabricate  high-frequency  nanotube  resonators 

under  tensile  stress.  The  tensile  stress  increases  upon  lowering  temperature,  since  the  suspended  Au 

electrodes contract. High-frequency resonators made from nanotubes hold promise for various scientific 

and  technological applications, such as mass sensing and experiments  in  the quantum  limit. Finally, our 

device  layout  allows  us  to  estimate  the  TEC  of  an  individual  nanotube.  In  future  high-speed,  high-

density  nanotube  circuits,  a  knowledge  of  the  nanotube  TEC  will  help  address  thermal  management 

issues.

Figure  1Sa  shows  the  resonance  frequency  as  a  function  of  Vg  (applied  on  the  backgate)  at  different 

temperatures and  for  a device  fabricated with  the process described  in  the main  text and having contact 

electrodes  separated  by  ~640  nm.  The  resonance  frequency  is  weakly  sensitive  to  Vg.  This  Vg 

 

11 

dependence  of  f0  differs  greatly  from  what  is  measured  in  nanotube  resonators  with  slack  (Fig.  1Sb) 

where 

 is much larger and positive. The latter behavior is well-documented and is attributed to the 

tension Te  that builds  in  the nanotube  as  it bends  towards  the backgate upon  increasing Vg

  1,2,3. The  fact 

that  this  behavior  is  not  observed  in  the  resonators  fabricated  with  the  process  described  in  this  paper 

(Fig.  1Sa)  is  an  indication  that  the  nanotube  is  under  tensile  stress  and  that  the  built-in  tension  T0  is 

much  larger  than  Te  (T0  >>  Te  since 

for  a  beam  under  tensile  stress  and  that  f0  is  not 

affected by the tension induced by the electrostatic force).
