Abstract. We study the coherent mixing between two-particle (single exciton)
and four-particle (biexciton) states of a semiconductor nanocrystal resulting from
the coulomb coupling between states with different numbers of electron-hole pairs.
Using a simple model of the nanocrystal wave functions and an envelope function
approach, we estimate the efficiency of the multiple exciton generation (MEG)
process resulting from such coherent admixture mechanism,
including all the
relevant states in a very broad energy interval. We show that in a typical ensemble
of nanocrystals with 3 nm average radius, the onset of the MEG process appears
about 1 eV above the lower edge of the biexciton density of states and the efficiency
of the process reaches 50% for photon energies around 5 eV. The MEG onset shifts
to lower energies and the efficiency increases as the radius grows. We point out
that the energy dependence of the MEG efficiency differs considerably between
ensembles with small and large inhomogeneity of nancrystal sizes.

Efficiency of the biexciton admixture mechanism for MEG

1. Introduction

Confining the carriers to a nanometer-scale volume of a semiconductor nanostructure
not only leads to qualitative modification of the energy spectrum but also changes
the relative role of various kinetic processes that take place in these systems.
In
particular, it has been proposed [1] that an enhancement of impact ionization processes
in nanostructures can be exploited to increase the efficiency of solar cells by enabling
multiple exciton generation (MEG) upon absorption of a single high-energy photon.
In spite of the initial controversy concerning the actual efficiency of this process
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which arouse from the experimental difficulty in extracting the real
MEG yields [8, 9, 10], direct measurements of photocurrent from nanocrystal-based
structures [11, 12] confirm the initial expectation that efficiency enhancement due to
the MEG process is feasible.

In the single-particle picture, only the transitions leading to creation of a single
electron-hole pair (exciton) are optically active. Therefore, the MEG process requires
Coulomb interactions that couple configurations with different numbers of excitons.
Such inter-band Coulomb couplings are indeed present in semiconductor nanocrystals
and can be theoretically computed by various methods [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24]. In their presence, there are various scenarios that can lead to the MEG
effect. For instance, one can think of a sequential process in which the initially created
high-energy exciton subsequently decays into the biexciton states that form a quasi-
continuum with very high density of states at sufficiently high energies. The rates for
such a process have been calculated using atomistic methods [16, 13, 14]. On the other
hand, biexciton states can be created coherently due to the Coulomb-induced mixing
between the single-exciton (X) and biexciton (BX) states [25, 26].
In this picture,
admixture of BX states to X states increases the average number of excitons in the
resulting few-particle eigenstate, while admixture of certain X states to BX states can
make the latter optically active. As a result, the nanocrystal state emerging from a
single photon absorption can involve more than one electron-hole pair on the average.
In this paper, we estimate the efficiency of MEG resulting from the admixture
mechanism in an InAs nanocrystal. We use the method for calculating the Coulomb
couplings between X and BX states based on the envelope function (k · p) approach
developed in our previous paper [25], which is a low-cost approximate method that
allows us to build statistics over very many X and BX states in a broad energy window
and for a distribution of nanocrystal sizes. The predicted efficiencies are in the range
of several up to 50% for photon energies below 5 eV, which is roughly consistent with
experimental findings [27, 9].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we present the model and the method
used to estimate the efficiencies. The results are discussed in Sec. 3. Sec. 4 concludes
the paper.

2. Model and method

We use the simple model of a spherical nanocrystal as in Ref. [25]. The carrier states
are modeled by single-band wave functions with envelopes corresponding to a simple
spherical potential well with infinite barriers, with a constant hole effective mass and
a self-consistent, energy-dependent electron mass [28, 25]. Thus, each single particle
state is characterized by the band and the three quantum numbers (n, l, m) for the
envelope wave function. Two kinds of few-particle configurations are relevant here:

Efficiency of the biexciton admixture mechanism for MEG

The first group are optically active (bight) states with one electron-hole (e-h) pair,
referred to as single exciton (X) states. In our model, for such states to be bright
(in the sense of a dipole-allowed transition), the quantum numbers n, l of the electron
and the hole must be the same, while the values of m must be opposite. In addition,
the band angular momentum ("spin") projection of the hole must be specified to fully
characterize the state. Only the states with holes from the j = 3/2 valence band can be
bright. The second group are states with two e-h pairs, referred to as biexciton (BX)
states. These are labeled by the full set of quantum numbers for the two electron and
two hole states, as well as the spin (singlet-triplet) configuration of the two electrons
and the subband ("spin") configuration of the two holes.

Only the diagonal (first order) Coulomb correction to the energies of X and BX
states as well as the electron and hole exchange energies for the BX states are taken
into account. This is done on the usual mesoscopic level of envelope functions. In
addition, the intraband Coulomb coupling (i.e., coupling between configurations with
a different number of e-h pairs), which is relevant for the effect to be discussed here,
is included. On the mesoscopic level, these Coulomb terms vanish in the single band
approximation due to orthogonality of Bloch functions [25, 26], hence they are taken on
the microscopic level involving the Bloch functions, in the first order of the expansion
in terms of a/R, where a is the lattice constant and R is the nanocrystal radius (see
Refs. [25, 26] for details). All the Coulomb couplings taken into account include both
the direct interaction term as well as interaction mediated by surface polarization
which is due to the dielectric discontinuity on the nanocrystal border. Here we only
include couplings corresponding to creation of an e-h pair with electron intraband
relaxation, with the other hole being a "spectator". The values of all the parameters,
corresponding to an InAs nanocrystal, are as in Ref. [25].

An inhomogeneous ensemble of nanocrystals is modeled by assuming a Gaussian
distribution of nanocrystal radii f (R), with the average R0 and standard deviation
σR. In practice, the size dependence of the Coulomb couplings is given by a simple
1/R or 1/R2 scaling [25], while the energies have been computed for 7 values of R
in the range (2.7, 3.3) meV and approximated by a quadratic fit, which yields a good
quantitative approximation in the required range of nanocrystal radii.

The BX admixture to an X state Xji in a nanocrystal of a given radius is
obtained (as in Ref. [25]) by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian including only the X state
in question and the BX sates BXii directly and sufficiently strongly coupled to Xji.
The criterium for the selection of these "sufficiently strongly coupled" BX states out of
the infinite number of such states is as follows: If hji is the magnitude of the coupling
matrix element between the two states and ∆Eji is the energy separation between
them, then a given state BX is included if the ratio qji = hji/∆Eji is larger than
0.01. Note that qji2 is the perturbative measure of the admixture of a given state BX
to X. After diagonalization of the Hamiltonian constructed in this way, we select the
eigenstate Ψ(j)
0 i with the highest X contribution as the new nominally single-exciton
state and its BX admixture is determined as

In the calculation of the MEG efficiency as a function of the photon energy,
we need the relative absorption by a given state and the resulting number of e-h
pairs. For a nominally single-exciton state, the former is proportional to the brightness

BX/X)sj of this state, where the nominal brightness sj = 1 for a heavy-hole
exciton and sj = 1/3 for a light-hole exciton. The contribution of this state to the
overall absorption of an inhomogeneous ensemble is f (R)Sj. On the other hand, its
relative contribution to the e-h pair production is f (R)Sj(1 + x(j)

BX/X).

The X admixture to bright BX states is determined in a similar way. We
diagonalize the Hamiltonian containing only the BX state in question (denoted BXji)
and all the bright X states Xii directly and sufficiently strongly coupled to the BX
state (those for which q ≥ 0.01). We identify the eigenstate Φ(j)
0 i which has the
biggest BX component and treat it as the new, corrected BX state. The single-exciton
admixture to this state is equal to

admixtures of various X states and their nominal brightness, respectively (in the vast
majority of cases, there is only one sufficiently strongly coupled X state). The relative
contribution to the absorption is f (R)Sj and the relative contribution to the e-h pair
production is f (R)Sj(2 − x(j)

X/BX).

In practice, since the largest Coulomb couplings found for our model of the
nanocrystal with a 3 nm radius are around 40 meV, we include admixed states
with energies up to 10 eV (in the whole relevant range of radii) in order to provide
quantitatively correct results in the 5 eV energy range of interest.

We then simulate an inhomogeneous nanocrystal ensemble by sampling the radius
distribution at 0.003 nm intervals and compute the dependence of the MEG efficiency
on energy as a histogram with the energy axis divided into finite bins of δE = 20 meV
width.
In the energy bin l with a central energy El, the total absorption rate is
calculated (up to a constant factor) as

f (Rn)Sj(Rn)Θ(δE/2 − El − Ej (Rn)),

where n numbers the nanocrystals in the simulated ensemble, j runs through all the
X and BX states, Θ is the Heavyside step function, and we have explicitly witten the
R-dependence of the energy and brightness of the state j. The e-h pair production
rate is

and ±1/2, respectively. In (a,b) selected low-energy states are shown. In (c,d) we
show some states of higher energy.

3. Results

We begin the discussion of the results from an overview of the typical values of X and
BX admixtures to the BX and X states, respectively, as well as their dependence on
the nanocrystal radius.

In Fig. 1(a,b) we show the BX admixture to a few selected low-energy states
(the exact information on the energies is contained in the Appendix) as a function
of the radius R. The value of this admixture remains very low even for states up to
1 eV above the lowest BX state, which is due to selection rules that exclude coupling
between excited bright X states and the lowest BX states [25]. The admixture to X
states with ±1/2 hole spin projection is typically slightly higher than to those with
±3/2 hole spin.

Fig. 1(c,d) presents the BX admixture for selected states with higher energies. In
general, much higher values are obtained in this case. The R dependence clearly has
a resonant character and peaks for some nanocrystal radii, when the coupled X and
BX states cross. As shown in Fig. 1(c,d), there is only very weak dependence on the
value of the quantum number m and on the hole spin projection in the X state.

Fig. 2 shows the admixture of X states to BX states. In most cases, this value
does not exceed 0.01, irrespective of the energy of a given BX state (see Appendix for
detailed information on the states selected for this figure) hence these states remain
nearly completely dark. However, as illustrated by the case (3) in Fig. 2, resonant
enhancement of the admixture may happen in the case of a resonance between the
chosen BX state and one of the X states. Then, in a relatively narrow peak, admixture
reaches 0.5. In spite of the large number of states sufficiently strongly coupled to one
of the bright states with energy below 5 eV (about 7500 BX states for R = 3 nm in
our model), there are only several tens of such resonances in this energy window.

Finally, Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the MEG efficiency on the photon energy.
In a nearly homogeneous ensemble of nanocrystals (Fig. 3(a)), the efficiency reaches

1 in certain energy intervals. Comparison with the absorption spectrum shows that
this happens only for energies where absorption is nearly absent. Clearly, the reason
for such an efficient biexciton generation is the discrete nature of the single exciton
density of states:
in a weakly inhomogeneous ensemble there are extended energy
intervals where no bright single exciton states are present so that all the absorption
originates from the quasi-continuous background of nearly purely biexcitonic states.
This picture is different in an ensemble of nanocrystals with a broader size
distribution (Fig. 3(b)). Now both the absorption and the MEG efficiency become
quasi-smooth functions of the photon energy and both grow nearly monotonically.
The onset of the MEG (the MEG threshold) is clearly marked at 3.5 eV, which should
be contrasted with the nominal onset of the BX density of states at ∼ 2.5 eV for

R = 3 nm.

The evolution of the energy dependence of the MEG efficiency with increasing
inhomogeneity is shown in more detail in Fig. 3(c). Here one can see that already
at σ = 0.04 nm the overlap of the inhomogeneously broadened absorption peak is
sufficient to suppress the large values of the efficiency, leafing only a few marked
maxima. These MEG efficiency peaks are then washed out as the inhomogeneity
grows further.

In Fig. 3(d) we show the MEG efficiency for three ensembles with different average
nanocrystal radii. The two features that can be noticed are the a shift of the MEG
threshold towards lower energies and larger overall values of the MEG efficiency for
larger nanocrystals.

4. Conclusions

We have estimated the quantum efficiency of the multiple exciton generation via
coherent, Coulomb-induced mixing of bright exciton and biexciton states. Although
the mixing is, in general, rather weak due to small values of the Coulomb coupling
elements (not exceeding a few tens of meV), it can become much stronger near the
crossing point between the X and BX energies at particular values of the nanocrystal
radius. The relatively low computational cost of the envelope function method used
in our calculations has allowed us to include all the relevant states in a 10 eV energy
window.

An interesting property that emerges from our calculations is the high MEG yield
in the energy intervals where the single exciton density of states vanishes in a weakly
inhomogeneous ensemble. Although this result has been obtained in our simple model
of nanocrystal wave functions, it essentially follows from the discrete nature of single-
exciton spectrum for moderate energies and the much more dense, quasi-continuous
spectrum of biexciton states. Therefore, it should be a general feature of highly
homogeneous nanocrystal ensembles. Whether this can be exploited in applications
depends on the technological feasibility of building a structure in which the very weak
absorption of biexciton states is accumulated to yield a considerable overall carrier
injection.

In contrast, for less homogeneous nanocrystal ensembles, both the absorption
and MEG efficiency are smooth functions of the photon energy, with a threshold at
about 3.5 eV for nanocrystals with 3 nm radius, which is 1 eV above the formal onset
of the biexciton density of states. The threshold shifts to lower energies for larger
nanocrystals. The efficiencies of the MEG process reach 50% for the photon energies
about 5 eV and average radius of 3.0 nm and increase for larger nanocrystals.

Appendix A. Information on the states used in the figures

In this appendix we present the detailed information about the states shown in Fig. 1
and Fig. 2.

Table A1 shows the energies of all the bright single exciton states with energies
below 5 eV at R = 3 nm. The values are shown for three nanocrystal radii. In our
model, bright states are those with identical quantum numbers n, l for the electron
and the hole (shown in the leftmost columns). Shifts induced by mixing with different
BX states lead to differences between the energies of X states with different values
of m as well as between states with different projections of the hole spin. However,

these differences are very small, within 10 meV, hence we show only the energies of
the state with 3/2 hole spin projection and m = 0.

Table A2 shows the full data on the states presented in Fig. 2. Here the first
four columns contain the quantum numbers nlm for the two electrons and the two
holes (negative values of m are denoted by a bar over the number) and the next two
columns show the spin configurations: For the electron, this is just singlet (S) or one
of the three triplet states (T0,±) with the total spin projection 0 or ±1. For two-hole
states with both holes with ±3/2 or with both holes with ±1/2 spin projection, the
basis configurations are also singlet or triplet, with the additional upper index (3/2)
or (1/2), respectively. In addition, configurations in which one hole has a 1/2 spin
projection and the other one has 3/2 spin projection appear in our calculations. For
these, we introduce the symmetrized and antisimmetrized spin states, denoted S↑⇑,
A↑⇑, etc, where thin and thick arrows correspond to hole states with the angular
momentum projection 1/2 and 3/2, respectively. The final three columns show the
energies of the state for three radii of a nanocrystal, as in the previous table.
