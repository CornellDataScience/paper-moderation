Abstract

Using multiband ~k · ~p theory we study the size and geometry dependence on the slow light prop-
erties of conical semiconductor quantum dots. We find the V -type scheme for electromagnetically

induced transparency (EIT) to be most favorable, and identify an optimal height and size for

efficient EIT operation. In case of the ladder scheme, the existence of additional dipole allowed

intraband transitions along with an almost equidistant energy level spacing adds additional decay

pathways, which significantly impairs the EIT effect. We further study the influence of strain and
band mixing comparing four different ~k · ~p band structure models. In addition to the separation of
the heavy and light holes due to the biaxial strain component, we observe a general reduction in the

transition strengths due to energy crossings in the valence bands caused by strain and band mixing

effects. We furthermore find a non-trivial quantum dot size dependence of the dipole moments

directly related to the biaxial strain component. Due to the separation of the heavy and light holes

the optical transition strengths between the lower conduction and upper most valence-band states

computed using one-band model and eight-band model show general qualitative agreement, with

exceptions relevant for EIT operation.

INTRODUCTION

InAs/GaAs quantum dot structures have recently received much attention due to their

relevance for optoelectronic devices.1 The discrete level nature of quantum dots offer im-

portant advantages over bulk and quantum well material for applications in conventional

devices like lasers and optical amplifiers, as well as devices for all-optical signal processing.

However, quantum dots also give the possibility of realizing solid-state implementations of

effects and functionalities so far only demonstrated in atomic systems. For instance, the

practical exploitation of slow light effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency

(EIT) demonstrated in ultracold atoms2 is naturally pursued using quantum dots.3 Impor-

tant aspects in this context are to accurately model the optical properties of the quantum

dots and to consider the influence of the lattice mismatch induced strain field and its effects

on the bandstructure and eigenstates. Apart from Refs. [4,5] that focus on the many-body

aspects of EIT operation most theoretical investigations of EIT induced slow light6 -- 9 have

been based on simple quantum dot models that do not take into account important contri-

butions from e.g. biaxial strain.

In this paper, we use ~k · ~p theory10,11 to determine the bandstructure of conical quan-
tum dots. A first popular ~k · ~p multiband calculation scheme for bulk materials is due to
Luttinger and Kohn12,13 which later on was extended to heterostructures by an ad hoc sym-

metrization procedure.14 In order to overcome this ad hoc procedure, Burt formulated the

so-called exact envelope function method15,16 and soon after Foreman17 used this method to

derive a six-band model for the valence bands of zincblende heterostuctures. Pokatilov et

al.18 have provided an eight-band model for the conduction and the valence bands. They

studied quantum dots using a spherical approximation and compared their model, based on

exact envelope-function theory, against the usual symmetrized approach. The asymmetry

parameter present in the Burt-Foreman formalism but not in the Luttinger-Kohn formalism
is shown to lead to changes of approximately ±25 meV in the electronic bandstructures of
InAs/GaAs.18

Optoelectronic properties of InGaAs zincblende quantum-dot with varying shape and
size based on ~k · ~p theory have already been studied by Schliwa et al.19 and Veprek et al..20
However, so far, only a small selection of all possible transitions have been studied. In this

work we apply the eight-band model based on Burt-Foreman formalism derived in Ref. [18]

3

to zincblende InAs/GaAs conical quantum dots. We choose the conical geometry because

(i) it introduces important symmetry lowering effects not present in the earlier spherical

models, and (ii) it mimicks closely the structures realized in experimental systems, e.g., in

Ref. [21]. We study the size and shape dependence. In particular, we show that some of

the, for EIT yet unexplored, interband transitions are highly relevant. Furthermore, we

investigate the effect of strain and band-mixing between the conduction band and valence
bands by comparing four different ~k · ~p models. Although the previous ~k · ~p bandstructure
studies do include these effects, their impact on optical properties, such as EIT, have not

yet been investigated.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the theory for EIT, bandstructure calcula-

tions and dipole moments is introduced. In Sec. III we present results for the bandstructure

and dipole moments calculations, addressing the volume and shape effects, while in Sec. IV

these results are used to develop level schemes that lead to an efficient EIT operation. The

paper is concluded in Sec. V.

II. THEORY

A. EIT

EIT refers to an artificially created spectral region of transparency in the middle of an

absorption line due to the destructive quantum interference arising from two transitions in

a three-level system.22,23 By virtue of the Kramers-Kronig relations a dip in absorption is

accompanied by a large positive slope of the refractive index which translates into a reduced

group velocity in vicinity of the resonance. Experimental realization of EIT in semiconductor

structures has been achieved for the case of quantum wells Ref. [24 -- 26], whereas for quantum

dots (QDs), to the best of our knowledge, only two reports exist.27,28

EIT effects in quantum dots and wells have mostly been studied using models that are

rooted in atomic physics assuming an archetypical EIT configuration in an ideal medium.3,6 -- 8

These models truncate the number of active levels in the system to consider only the 3 levels

being addressed by the laser fields. The generic EIT setup relies on a coupling and a probe
laser driving separate transitions (see Fig. 1). In case of the Λ-scheme, the ground state 1i
has the same parity as state 3i, and the transition is thereby dipole forbidden. State 2i

4

is of the opposite parity and dipole coupled to both 1i and 3i. An intense near resonant
continuous wave electromagnetic field, termed the coupling field, drives the 2i-3i transition.
Another also near resonant, but much weaker probe field, is applied to the 1i-2i transition.

FIG. 1: The three generic EIT schemes. ωp and ωc refer to the frequency of the probe and coupling

transitions, respectively.

The archetypical EIT schemes are native to the atomic physics literature and gener-

ally one seeks to avoid excitation of carriers. In semiconductors such non-carrier exciting

schemes involve a interband probe transition along with an intraband coupling transition.

The frequency for the coupling field lies within the deep infrared, a range for which high

intensity laser operation is very difficult. Carrier exciting schemes on the other hand involve

two interband transitions, where the coupling field is effectively pumping carriers into the

conduction band. The carriers interact via the Coulomb force, EIT schemes of this kind have

been shown to be favorable when the effect of such many-body interactions are included.4,5,29

The study of pulse propagation in a semiconductor slow light medium generally involves

solving the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations (see e.g. Ref. [30]). However, under certain

circumstances an analysis of the steady state properties of the semiconductor Bloch equations

(SBE) alone is adequate.29 If this is the case then the linear optical response extracted via

the SBE will be directly linked to the propagation characteristics of a wavepacket traveling

in an optically thick system.

A relevant figure of merit for slow light operation is the slowdown factor S, which is

defined as the ratio of the velocity of light in vacuum to the group velocity of a wavepacket

traveling through the slow light medium:

is largest. Notice that the slowdown factor obtained away from resonance ( ∂n

The maximum slowdown is found at the frequency for which the slope of the refractive index
∂ω ≈ 0) is given
by the background refractive index. The first order susceptibility, or linear system response,
is found from the induced macroscopic polarization P (ω) as χ(ω) = P (ω)

ǫ0Ep(ω) , where ǫ0 is the
vacuum permittivity and Ep(ω) is the amplitude of the probe field. In turn the time resolved

macroscopic polarization component in the direction of the probe field, P (t), is computed

from the microscopic polarizations according to semiclassical theory:31

where ρnm is the density matrix for localized dot states (n, m). Dipole matrix elements are

denoted µnm, Ndot is the two-dimensional density of the dots in the growth plane, and w is

the thickness of the active region. Within the 3-level, (non-carrier exciting) approximation

one can derive an analytical expression for the susceptibility χ(ω) (see e.g. Ref. [3]). When

both fields are resonant with their respective transitions (ω = ωp), the slowdown factor S

and the absorption α become:

of the probe and the uncoupled non-radiative transition, respectively. The above expressions

displays the significance of maximizing the transition strengths of the two light beams. In

case of the slowdown factor the dipole moment of the probe transition determines the largest

obtainable slowdown, while the dipole moment of the pump transition is related to the pump
power required to reach this maximum. The absorption drops as 1/µc2.

B. Bandstructure

The dipole moments which govern the EIT characteristics are determined using eight-
band ~k · ~p theory including strain effects. We study the conical quantum dots shown in
Fig. 2. The dot material is InAs and the barrier material is GaAs. Both InAs and GaAs are

zincblende materials so in order to reduce the problem to a two dimensional model we dis-

regard anisotropy effects. This entails that we disregard phenomena such as piezoelectricity

and atomistic anisotropic effects32,33. The atomistic anisotropic effects have been investi-

gated by Bester and Zunger34 showing that they lead amongst other things to a splitting

of states which in our model are degenerate. This splitting is however less pronounced for

cylindrical shaped quantum dots as studied here. Recently it has been shown that second

order piezoelectric terms effectively cancel linear piezoelectric effects for cylindrical shaped

quantum dots.

19,35,36 We have checked the isotropic assumption and found a maximum

error for the strain fields of 8% along the z axis, going rapidly to zero at the edges of the

dot.

We investigate both the effect of strain and band mixing. The effect of band mixing

is determined by comparing the eight-band results with one-band model results for the

conduction band and the heavy holes. Due to the lattice mismatch present in the systems

under consideration in this paper (InAs/GaAs quantum dots) the materials will be strained.

7

In the eight-band model the wavefunction ψn of the localized dot state n is given by a linear

combination of the eight Bloch states weighted by an envelope function,

ψn =

(5)

where φ(n)

i

are the envelope function and ui are the Bloch states. We use the eight-band

Hamiltonian described in Ref. [18], while for the strain-dependent part we follow Ref. [37].

In the following we explicitly present the one-band models as due to their simplicity

these are most open to interpretation. The one-band eigenvalue equation for the envelope

functions reads Hαφα = Eαφα where Hα, φα and Eα are the Hamiltonian, the envelope wave

function and the energy, respectively. α denotes either the conduction band or the heavy
holes, i.e., α = {e, hh}. The Hamiltonian is

Hα = H k

where H k

α(~rα) is the kinetic part, H b

α( ~rα) is the energy of the unstrained band edge, and
α( ~rα) is the strain dependent part. The solutions are spin degenerate in the one-band

model, i. e., ψ↑

e = φeS ↑i and ψ↓

e = φeS ↓i, and ψ↑

hh = φhhhh ↑i and ψ↓

hh = φhhhh ↓i.

In the one-band model the strain Hamiltonian for a zincblende crystal structure is given

by

(7)

(8)

where ac (av) and b are the conduction (valence)-band hydrostatic deformation potential and

b is the shear deformation potential,38 while the hydrostatic and biaxial strain components

read

εH(~r) = εxx(~r) + εyy(~r) + εzz(~r),

εB(~r) = εxx(~r) + εyy(~r) − 2εzz(~r),

(9)

(10)

where εik is the strain tensor. The strain fields are found by minimizing the elastic strain

energy.32

(11)

where N = 1 or 8. ~p (φ) and ~p (u) are the envelope and the Bloch parts of the momentum

matrix element, respectively.

It is usual to consider only the Bloch part ~p (u) since the

envelope part ~p (φ) is usually an order of magnitude smaller.39

As shown in Ref. [40], the evaluation of the momentum matrix element ~pnm is meaningful

while dipole matrix ~µnm elements are ill-defined in crystals involving extended Bloch states.

Thus, we first calculate ~pnm and then use the relation between the momentum and the

electric dipole matrix element given by Ref. [41]

~pnm =

where ωnm = En − Em, m0 is the free electron mass and e is the electronic charge.

For material parameters used in calculations we refer to Ref. [42].

III. RESULTS: BANDSTRUCTURE AND DIPOLE MOMENTS

The first results we present are related to a set of conical quantum dots where the aspect

ratio between the radius r and the height h of the dot has been fixed so that r = 2h. We

focused on the first twelve bound states for both bands. Since all the states are at least

doubly degenerate (spin degeneracy), we consider six energy levels (labeled from 1 to 6) for

both bands. In the one-band model, due to the conical quantum-dot symmetry and isotropy

assumption (giving an inversion symmetric model), level 2 and level 3 are degenerate for

both the conduction and the valence band, level 4 and level 5 are degenerate for the valence

band, and level 5 and level 6 are degenerate for the conduction band. In the upper part of

Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 we show the energy levels and the most relevant interband dipole moments

for EIT (µ22 is also included due to its relevance for other applications) corresponding to

9

a dot with h = 7.5 nm for the four different models: one-band model without strain, one-

band model with strain, eight-band model without strain and eight-band model with strain.

Throughout this paper we consider only right-handed circularly polarized light.

strongest interband dipole moments (bottom) for one-band (left) and eight-band (right) model

In Figs. 3 and 4 the thicknesses of the lines indicating the transitions are proportional

to the corresponding dipole moments. Obviously, an eight-band model calculation leads

to a higher valence-band density-of-states as compared to a one-band calculation. Hence,

also more interband transitions result, in a given energy range, when using an eight-band

model. We have chosen to show in the bottom part of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 only the strongest

eight dipole-matrix elements for both one-band and eight-band models. First, we observe

that there is a qualitative agreement between dipole-moment results for the one-band and

eight-band models with strain (Figure 4). This is due to the fact that in the eight-band

FIG. 4: Energy levels and the most relevant dipole moments for EIT (top) and values of the eight

model the biaxial strain component of Eq. (10) shifts heavy-holes (light-holes) to higher

(lower) energies. As a consequence the valence-band groundstate and the first excited states

are predominantly heavy-holes like giving rise to a general better agreement between the

one-band model and the eight-band model. The only notable discrepancies are observed for

the EIT relevant transitions µ46 and µ41. Second, the inclusion of strain reduces the strength

of the dipole moments significantly. This is because there is a non-trivial influence of strain

on dipole moments. The conduction-band states are only affected by the hydrostatic strain

component of Eq. (9) giving rise more or less to a constant shift in the effective potential

inside the dot while the valence band states, in addition to the hydrostatic strain, are also

affected by the biaxial strain component [see Eq. (10)]. The latter component is highly

inhomogeneous inside the dot. In the eight-band model there is a third contribution from

11

ǫxz and ǫyz strain components37 but this term is not as significant as the biaxial of Eq. (10).

In order to understand the influence of strain on the dipole moment we compare in Fig. 5
the valence-band groundstate probability density ψ2 (eight-band model) with and without
the influence of the strain field for a quantum dot with height h = 11.5 nm and radius

r = 23 nm. While in the case without strain the groundstate shows a s-like shape, the

biaxial-strain component modifies the hole wave function into a toroidal shape moving it

away from the center of the dot where the potential is stronger. This drastically reduces

the overlap between the envelope functions φi of the conduction and valence band and

consequently the corresponding dipole moments.

The reduction of the dipole moment due to strain is evident in Fig. 6 where we plot

the interband dipole moment µ11 between the conduction- and the valence-band ground

states for the four different models as a function of h. In the models with strain we have a

maximum around h = 5 nm while the dipole moments for the two models without strain grow

monotonically with increasing height and eventually reach a plateau value corresponding to
the bulk value of 16.8 Ae. The monotonic increase of the dipole moments can be understood

based on Eq. (12). Without strain the momentum matrix elements ~p (mainly determined by

~p (u)) remains constant with increasing height whereas the energy difference ωnm decreases.

The presence of strain reduces the overlap of electron and hole distributions as a result of

FIG. 7: Energies of the six considered levels in conduction (top) and valence (bottom) band as a

is also indicated (dashed-horizontal line).

In Fig. 7 we plot the energies of the first six levels in the conduction (top) and valence

band (bottom) as a function of the height h. The wave functions of the confined states are

characterized (in the eight-band model) by eight envelopes weighted differently depending

13

on the state. As mentioned above, the biaxial strain is inhomogeneous and this, combined

with the differently spatially distributed envelope functions, leads to a higher sensitivity

against strain as compared to a one-band model. Further, the inhomogeneity of the strain

field grows with volume, especially for the biaxial-strain component of Eq.

(10). These

coupled strain-band mixing effects lead to energy crossings in the valence band. We have

also indicated where the wetting layer continuum starts (WL). The WL dashed lines in Fig. 7

are computed using a Ben-Daniel Duke approach for a 0.5 nm InAs quantum-well embedded

in GaAs14. We observe that only the last three considered conduction-band levels for the

smallest quantum dot lay above the lower bound of the wetting layer continuum states.

The most relevant dipole moments for EIT for the eight-band model are shown in the

upper part of Fig. 8 as a function of h. The bottom part gives the related energy differences

∆E. The strain reduces the dipole-moment strengths with increasing volume because of the

decreasing wave function overlap (similar to what was found for µ11).

This geometry effect is indeed mainly a function of the dot volume as Fig. 9 shows. Here,

we refer to a second set of quantum dots with different aspect ratios (Asp = r/h) having
the same volume (V = 226.19 (nm)3). The interband dipole moments (top) and relative

energy differences (bottom) are depicted as a function of Asp and evidently results are rather

insensitive to the aspect ratio.

IV. RESULTS: EIT

A. 3 level vs. many levels

In this section we consider right-handed circularly polarized light for both the coupling

and probe fields and investigate the slow light characteristics upon propagation through

several stacked layers of QD material. We assume that one can disregard propagation effects

in the coupling field. In case of non-carrier exciting schemes, the coupling field is effectively

connecting two empty states, thus rendering the transition transparent. In the case where the

coupling beam is exciting carriers we consider a propagation through sufficiently thin device

so that the coupling intensity remains constant. We use a lattice temperature of 200 K, for
which the literature 43,44 gives dephasing rates around 1.5 · 1012 s−1. The system response is
calculated using a procedure similar to Ref. [29]. First we investigate a ladder-type scheme.

The ladder scheme is generally non-carrier exciting. We consider a situation where the probe

pulse connects the conduction band/valence band ground state (µ11) and the coupling beam

is tuned to the intraband transition in the conduction band between the ground state -

FIG. 10: Example of susceptibility calculated for a ladder scheme using the 3 level - or a full

multi level approach based on either the eight band strained or one band unstrained model. The

results are presented for dots of height 7.5 nm (top panel) and 9 nm (bottom panel), both Asp = 2.

The reason for the larger features in the one band calculations is that the strength of the probe

transition is larger within this model (see Fig. 6).

is recognized as a dip in the absorption spectrum symmetric around the probe frequency

and is present in the simple three level models, is absent from three out of four multi-level

calculations. The reason for this is that the additional level structure is dipole coupled to the

three level EIT system. In the particular ladder configuration considered here, due to the

relatively close spacing between the energy levels, higher lying states are also being addressed

by the coupling field thereby adding alternative decay pathways that effectively destroy the

destructive interference between the available paths, which is at the origin of EIT. In the

one band unstrained calculation the energy levels are almost equidistantly spaced resulting

in a peak in stead of a dip in the spectrum. The level structure is modified by strain and

the inclusion of additional bandstructure, in fact the multi-level model for the dot of 7.5 nm

height indeed displays the EIT effect. In this particular case the higher lying shells are not

16

in as close resonance with the coupling beam and a simple three level treatment is seen to

produce similar results as the full multi-level model. The eight-band multi-level calculation

for the larger dot (h = 9 nm) has reminiscence of the EIT effect but the spectrum is quite

far from the "ideal" spectrum predicted by the simple model. In general, ladder schemes in

rotationally symmetric dots are, due to the near equidistantly spaced energy levels, likely

subjected to the issue of the coupling beam being in resonance with other transitions. Carrier

exciting Λ or V - schemes connecting only inter-band transitions are due to their larger

transition energies much less likely to encounter this problem. Furthermore, the frequency

range of inter-band transitions is much easier accessible to industry lasers, than the near

infrared required by ladder-type schemes.

B. Size/geometry dependence

The possible interband EIT schemes are illustrated in Fig. 4 (top). By combining the

shown EIT relevant transitions a variety of different V as well as Λ-schemes can be accessed.

As noted in a previous section there are very few differences between dipole moments pre-

dicted by the one-band strained model and the eight-band strained model, however the

deviations that do exist, appears for transitions that could be used in connection with EIT.

The one-band strained model significantly overestimates µ46, a transition that would other-

wise seem attractive to use for EIT. Furthermore µ41 is very small in all but the eight-band

strained model. To illustrate the impact of these differences we have in Fig. 11 shown ab-

sorption spectra for an EIT scheme constructed using µ41 as probe and µ46 as coupling

transition. It is seen that using eight-band strained bandstructure results in an altered EIT

behavior. The signature feature, the split peaks, are higher and closer together, a direct

consequence of the magnitudes of the involved dipole moments. These significant differences

between the spectra justifies focusing on the results of the more exact eight-band strained

bandstructure model. A V and Λ scheme can be realized using µ41 as coupling transition

and either of the two transitions µ11 or µ46 for the probe field. Two similar schemes can

be accessed using the same probe transitions and µ16 for the coupling field. As is evident

from Fig. 9 the dipole moments are relatively unchanged by varying shape (aspect ratio), we

choose to focus on Asp = 2 since the common probe transitions (µ11 and µ46) are maximized

for this geometry and consider volume dependencies.

FIG. 11: EIT absorption spectrum calculated using µ41 as probe and µ46 as coupling transition for

different models: one-band unstrained (full line), one-band strained (dashed line) and eight-band

strained (dotted line). The additional feature in the eight-band strained calculation is due to the

nearby lying µ55 resonance.

We see that for small dots (h < 5 nm) the dipole moments addressed by the coupling

beam are relatively small (on the order of 1 nm) and therefore dots of this size are not

suitable for EIT operation. As the dot increases in size both coupling transitions become

stronger, the two probe transitions, however begins to decrease. The dipole µ46 is always

the smaller of the two probe transitions, and the fact that it drops off faster suggests that

one should aim at using µ11, ground state to ground state, as probe transition.

To quantify the above discussion we show in Fig. 12 the slowdown factor as a function

of coupling intensity calculated for three different dot volumes (h = 6.5 nm, 8 nm, 10 nm)

for each of the two remaining EIT schemes (for the h = 10 nm dot, in the case of the Λ

scheme no EIT behavior is found due to its weak coupling transition. Slowdown results

for this dot/EIT setup has therefore been omitted in Fig. 12.). For every dot type we see

that the V -scheme prevails, it has the lowest coupling power requirements and the largest

obtainable slowdown value. The first observation can be understood from Fig. 8 where the

V -scheme coupling transition µ41 is always the larger. Since both schemes utilize the same

probe transition one could be inclined to think that they should display the same maximum

slowdown value. The reason they do not, is that the coupling beam, although detuned, is

exciting carriers into the levels connected by the probe beam. The presence of the carriers

18

serve to block the probe transition. As indicated in the lower part of Fig. 8, the coupling

beam in the Λ case is less detuned from the probe transition than in the V case, and thus

more carriers are excited into the electron and hole ground states, resulting in a smaller

effective probe transition strength. It is apparent that the best tradeoff between maximum

slowdown and coupling intensity is found using the V scheme for dots having a relatively

large height, in the region around 8 nm. In the literature the V scheme has also been deemed

preferable due to its ability to overcome inhomogeneous broadening,9 and a favorable carrier

redistribution mechanism.29

V. CONCLUSION

For the investigated system we have shown that the strain field generally reduces optical

transition strengths as a function of the volume of the quantum dot for a fixed aspect

ratio. This is due to a decreasing overlap of the involved wavefunctions. This geometry

effect has been shown to be a volume effect rather than a shape effect. Moreover, the

combined influence of band mixing and strain entails state crossings in the valence band,

and a separation of the heavy and light holes. The latter leads to a qualitative agreement

between the lower conduction and upper most valence-band states computed using the one-

band model and the eight-band model. The observed discrepancies for µ46 and µ41 have an

impact on the choice of EIT scheme. We have investigated the importance of including the

19

full energy level structure and optical transitions in an EIT simulation. In particular we find

for a ladder type scheme that the additional transitions along with an almost equidistant

energy level spacing can severely impair the EIT effect. We have studied the effect of varying

dot size and geometry on EIT and identified a V -type configuration in a dot of aspect ratio
r = 2h with height h ≈ 8 nm to have the best possibilities for efficient EIT operation.
