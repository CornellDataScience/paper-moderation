We study the role of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) in the evolution of two-band quantum
systems. We show that all its components play an important role on the extra phase acquired by a
spinor and on the trajectory of an accelerated wavepacket in any realistic finite-duration experiment.
While the adiabatic phase is determined by the Berry curvature (the imaginary part of the tensor),
the non-adiabaticity is determined by the quantum metric (the real part of the tensor). We derive,
for geodesic trajectories, (corresponding to acceleration from zero initial velocity), the semiclassical
equations of motion with non-adiabatic corrections. The particular case of a planar microcavity
in the strong coupling regime allows to extract the QGT components by direct light polarization
measurements and to check their effects on the quantum evolution.

PACS numbers:

In 1984, Berry [1] has shown that the quantum evolu-
tion in a parameter space leads to the accumulation of an
extra phase in the wave function, the famous Berry phase
(already known in optics as the Pancharatnam phase [2]).
Over the last decades, this concept and its generaliza-
tion – Berry curvature – were understood to be among
the most general in physics. For instance, the topolog-
ical insulators [3] are classified by the Chern number[4]
– an integer topological invariant obtained by integrat-
ing the Berry curvature over a complete energy band.
Berry curvature also strongly affects the trajectory of an
accelerated wave packet (WP), creating a lateral drift:
an anomalous velocity, transverse to the acceleration.
This anomalous velocity is at the origin of many crucial
phenomena in physics such as the anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) [5–7], the intrinsic Spin Hall effect for electrons[8]
and light [9, 10], or the Valley Hall effect [11, 12] in Tran-
sition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs), the latter being a
pillar of the emerging field called "valleytronics" [13].

However, Berry curvature is actually a part of a more
general object: the quantum geometric tensor (QGT).
The gauge invariant QGT was introduced in 1980 by
Provost and Vallee [14] as a part of a geometric ap-
proach to quantum mechanics [15]. The imaginary part
of this Hermitian tensor corresponds to the Berry cur-
vature [1, 16], whereas its real part defines a Rieman-
nian metric, which allows to measure the distance be-
tween quantum states (Fubini-Study metric). Several re-
cent theoretical works discuss the properties of this quan-
tum metric for adiabatic quantum computation or to the
study of phase transitions [17–19]. In condensed matter,
the real part of the QGT has been shown to be linked
to the superfluid fraction of flat bands [20, 21], to cur-
rent noise in an insulator [19], to Lamb shift analog for
exciton states in TMDs [22], and to orbital magnetic sus-
ceptibility in Bloch bands [23, 24].

The two parts of the QGT play complementary roles
when the Hamiltonian of the system changes over time.

The imaginary part (Berry curvature) defines the addi-
tional Berry phase in the adiabatic limit, while the real
part (quantum distance) determines the non-adiabaticity
(NA), which, in turn, brings a correction to the Berry's
formalism. NA in quantum systems has been studied ex-
tensively since the pioneering works of Landau [25, 26],
Zener [27], Dykhne [28], and many others [29–31], con-
cerning the regime where the NA is exponentially small,
whereas configurations with power-law NA were gener-
ally considered as somewhat less interesting [28, 32]. The
Landau quasi-classical formalism allows to calculate the
final non-adiabatic fraction (transition probability) when
the perturbation smoothly vanishes at infinities. How-
ever, this approach cannot be applied to a simple yet
important situation of a spin following a magnetic field
rotating with a constant angular velocity, because the
perturbation does not vanish. Berry himself trusted that
the NA is exponentially small [1], but that is not the case
in the configuration he considered [33, 34], as we shall
see below. Moreover, the NA changes during the evo-
lution, and its final value (residual NA) is different from
the maximal one. The Landau-Zener formalism allows to
find only the former, while the latter is not exponentially
small even if the evolution is perfectly smooth.
In all
these cases, the real part of the QGT allows to quantify
the NA and brings an important correction to the Berry
phase.

In this work, we calculate the non-adiabatic correc-
tions (NAC) for the phases and trajectories of WPs
for a finite-time quantum evolution beyond the Landau-
Zener approximation, considering the important family
of geodesic trajectories, corresponding to acceleration
from zero initial velocity. We show that these NACs are
quantitatively described by the real part of the QGT,
whereas the adiabatic limit is described by the imagi-
nary part (Berry phase). We propose an example of ap-
plication of this formalism in a specific system: a planar
microcavity [35] in the strong coupling regime. We show

that the use of such photonic structures allows, through
simple light polarization measurements, a direct access
to the components of the QGT in reciprocal space, pro-
viding an answer to an important problem of the recent
years – the direct measurement of Berry curvature and
geometric quantities [36–44]. We consider a practical ex-
perimental situation showing how the real and imaginary
part of the QGT control the AHE.

Rotation of a spin. The Bloch sphere represents the
simplest 2-level system with Berry curvature: a spin, in-
teracting with an applied magnetic field. Any 2-level
Hamiltonian can be written as a superposition of Pauli
matrices, and thus considered as an effective field acting
on a pseudospin.

A spin, which follows a slowly rotating magnetic field,
is never perfectly aligned with it, and thus it exhibits
fast precession (with frequency Ω) about the magnetic
field together with the slow rotation (freq. ω) of both
of them in the azimuthal plane (see Fig. 1(a)). This
behavior is similar to the rotation of a small wheel at-
tached to a long shaft (Fig. 1(b)): the wheel, rotating
around its axis with the angular frequency Ω, at the same
time rotates with the frequency ω around the shaft fix-
ation point. For both the spin and the wheel, there is
an important rotational energy associated with the large
frequency Ω, but another part of the energy is associated
with the circular motion ω. Nobody could think of ne-
glecting the kinetic energy of the wheel's motion mv2/2.
However, the energy of the spin's slow rotation encoded
in the Berry phase has been less evident to see. It can be
obtained by applying the energy operator E = i∂/∂t to
√
2(e−iωt, 1)T eiΩt/2 (valid
the rotating spinor ψ(t) = 1/
in the limit ω → 0), which gives (cid:104) E(cid:105) = −Ω/2 + ω/2.
The first term in this expression is the usual energy of
the spin in the magnetic field ("dynamical phase"), and
the second is the energy associated with the Berry phase
which appears because of the time dependence of the
spinor. For the time T = 2π/ω of one full rotation of
the field it gives γB = ωT / = π. Taking into account
only the interaction of the spin with the magnetic field
−ΩS/2 is like going into the reference frame of the disk:
we should not forget that this frame is moving. One can
then take a derivative over the parameters of the wave-
function (WF), to get rid of the explicit time dependence
i(cid:104)ψ  ∂ψ/∂t(cid:105) = i(cid:104)ψ  ∂ψ/∂ϕ(cid:105) ∂ϕ/dt.

Because of the finite experiment duration, the spin
does not perfectly follow the field and gets out of the
azimuthal plane, tracing a cycloidal trajectory. The cor-
responding WF can be written as

energy. The average value of θ for the cycloidal trajectory
of Fig. 1(a) corresponds to the equilibrium polar angle
θ = π/2 − ω/Ω, at which the spin can follow the field
without precession [34, 45, 46], giving [45] E = −Ω/2 +
ω/2(1+2ω/Ω), and a final extra phase γ = π(1+2ω/Ω)
or ∆γ/γB = 4π/(ΩT ) for one full rotation time T .

The total extra phase after one full rotation of the mag-
netic field from the numerical solution of the Schrodinger
equation is plotted in Fig. 1(c) as a function of the rota-
tion duration T measured in units of precession periods
2π/Ω (equivalent to the frequency ratio Ω/ω). Larger
T means slower rotation and the adiabatic limit corre-
sponds to T → ∞ or ω/Ω → 0. We see that the extra
phase indeed converges to the value π, but the correction
is not negligible: ∆γ/γB > 30% for ω > Ω/10. The dif-
ference between the exact extra phase and the adiabatical
value of π is shown in a Log-Log plot on Fig. 1(d), again
as a function of T (black curve). We see that instead of
being exponentially small, this correction decreases only
as 1/T . The analytical NAC, ∆γ/γB = 4π/(ΩT ) (red
curve), fits the exact result very well [45].

Quantum Geometric Tensor. The QGT allows to gen-
eralize the above development to an arbitrary parameter
space and to unite both contributions to the extra phase
acquired by the WF in a single mathematical entity. In
general, a metric tensor gij determines how the distance
ds between two infinitesimally separated points depends
on the difference of their coordinates λi:

ds2 = gijdλidλj

(2)

tance is measured by the Fubini-Study metric, deter-
mined by the WF overlap ds2 = 1−(cid:104)ψ(λ)ψ(λ + δλ)(cid:105)2.
Minimal distance ds = 0 corresponds to a maximal over-
lap of 1, while maximal distance ds = 1 corresponds to
orthogonal states. At each point of the Hilbert space,
the metric is thus determined by the WF ψ(λ), and the
corresponding metric tensor is defined as the real part of

(cid:29)

where ψ is the WF, λi and λj are the coordinates in
the parameter space. Later, it was understood that the
imaginary part of this tensor is the Berry curvature [16]:

B = 2(cid:61)[Tij] = (cid:61)[∇λ × (cid:104)ψ(λ)∇λψ(λ)(cid:105)]

(4)

which determines the Berry phase for a closed path in
the parameter space.

Both components of the QGT contribute to the phase
of the WF in any finite-duration experiment: Berry cur-
vature determines the adiabatic value for the phase, while
the quantum metric allows to determine a correction due
to the NA. The average NA fraction (fraction of the ex-
cited state in the WF) for a spin on the Bloch sphere
can be found as fN A,eq = ω2/4Ω2 [45], which is gener-

alized by using ω (λ) = 2ds/dt = 2(cid:112)gλλ (λ)dλ/dt and

Ω = Ω(λ):

It determines the corrections to the Berry phase and also
to the AHE trajectory for finite-duration experiments in
a general parameter space.

QGT and WP trajectory. Berry curvature has been
shown to affect the trajectory of accelerated WPs, creat-
ing an anomalous velocity contribution in the AHE [5, 6].
The semiclassical equations of motion for the center of
mass of a quantum WP in presence of Berry curvature
can be derived using the Lagrangian formalism [6, 47–
50]):

where  is the energy dispersion, B(k) is the Berry curva-
ture and F is an external conservative force, accelerating
the wave-packet. For charged particles, F is an electric
force. Magnetic forces, known to affect the magnetic sus-
ceptibility [23, 24, 51], are not the subject of the present
work. Different types of corrections to these equations
have been considered in the past [52–54]. Non-adiabatic
corrections account for the fact that the WF is a superpo-
sition of two eigenstates ψ = f0ψ0 + f1ψ1 (where f12 =
fN A found above). Their respective energies contribute

both to the first term:  (k) = f020 (k) +f121 (k), ul-
timately providing a second-order correction to the group
velocity. Other NA corrections concern the second term,
and, in a general case, the first-order corrections found
in [53] should dominate.

Along geodesic lines, which is actually the most im-
portant case, corresponding to acceleration from v = 0
under a constant force F (the configuration of Hall ef-
fect), all first-order and second-order corrections cancel,
except one. This single correction appears because the
metric along the true trajectory of ψ is not the same as
the one along equator of the Bloch sphere (followed by
the eigenstates ψ0 and ψ1). Indeed:

The Berry connection above involves intra- and inter-
band terms [53]. For the Berry curvature appearing in
the AHE, the intraband terms add up to 1, while the
inter-band terms cancel out, giving simply B = B0/ sin θ,
where B0 is the Berry curvature of the instantaneous
eigenstate ψ0. The Lagrangian formalism provides [45]
the corrected equation for the trajectory:

This equation is the main result of our manuscript. It
shows that the anomalous velocity is a sum of the adia-
batic value (as in Eq. (6)) and a NAC (the second term
in the parenthesis). We stress that this equation is only
valid when the field follows a geodesic trajectory in the
parameter space, as in the AHE. In such case, while the
renormalized energy  brings second-order corrections to
the acceleration in the direction of the force, the anoma-
lous velocity only includes the correction from the varia-
tion of the metric due to the NA, because the other first
and second-order corrections to this term cancel out.

QGT in a planar cavity. Exploring the whole Bloch
sphere requires all 3 components of the effective mag-
netic field. If one deals with light, it means controlling
the splittings between linear and circular polarizations.
This is why we have chosen a model system consisting of
a microcavity in the strong coupling regime [35], where
the polariton modes appear from exciton and photon
resonances. The photonic fraction provides a βk2 in-
plane spin-orbit coupling (SOC) due to the TE-TM split-
ting [55, 56], while the exciton mode provides the Zee-
man splitting ∆ [57, 58] (under applied magnetic field or

thanks to spin-anisotropic interactions [59]). A remark-
able feature of this scheme is that the pseudo-spin can
be easily measured via the polarization of light [45].

We begin with the parabolic spinor Hamiltonian of the

lower polariton branch (LPB) of a planar cavity:

We have used ∆ = 60 µeV and β = 0.14 meV/µm−2.
While the system clearly shows no gap because of the
positive mass of both branches, and therefore is not an
example of topological insulator, it nevertheless exhibits
a non-zero Berry curvature, reflected by the pseudospin
texture (Fig. 2(b)). This dipolar pseudospin texture is
also typical for bilayer graphene around K points [60],
where quadratic degeneracies can be opened by a bias
voltage [61, 62]. We compute analytically the QGT for
the lower eigenstate in polar coordinates (k,φ):

These are plotted as solid curves in Fig. 3. Because of
the k2 dependence of the TE-TM SOC, the form of the
Berry curvature is different from the one of Rashba SOC
[7, 49] (with maximum at k = 0) and similar to the one
of bilayer graphene [63].

A very interesting opportunity to measure these QGT
components directly is offered by the radiative states of
photonic systems which allow to access all pseudospin

components S via polarization:

To demonstrate that the QGT components including the

To conclude, we derive a new correction to the semi-
classical equations of motion of an accelerated WP on
geodesic trajectories in two-band systems appearing in
any realistic finite-duration experiment. While the adi-
abatic limit is determined by the Berry curvature, the
NAC is determined by the quantum metric. The par-
ticular case of a planar microcavity in strong coupling
regime allows to extract the QGT components by direct
measurements and to check their effects on the quantum
evolution.

In Section III, we present
the computation of the average correction to the en-

Section IV, we derive the semiclassical equations of mo-
tion for a wavepacket on a geodesic trajectory using the
effective Lagrangian formalism. Section V shows that
the previously found first-order corrections cancel on the
geodesics. In Section VI, we provide details on the non-
adiabatic evolution in the particular case of polaritons.
We describe the experimental measurement of the non-
adiabaticity in such systems in Section VII. In Section
VIII, we present the analytical expressions for the po-
lariton anomalous Hall drift obtained using the corrected

nally, a movie (available as a separate file) of a numerical
simulation of the polariton anomalous Hall effect is dis-

angle of the magnetic field). We see that these equations
are similar to the Hamilton's equations for a harmonic
oscillator in rescaled coordinates (η plays the role of co-
ordinate q and ζ – the role of momentum p), but with
an extra term dη/dt = −ω, corresponding to a constant
velocity of the harmonic oscillator, meaning that we con-
sider it in a moving reference frame, or that the oscillator
itself is moving in our fixed reference frame. This falls
very well within the analogy with a rotating wheel con-
sidered in the main text.

First of all, we can find a stationary solution:

ζeq =

ω
Ω

(19)

It means that if the magnetic field rotates with a con-
stant angular velocity ω, the spin is able to follow it with
the same angular velocity if it is deviated from the equa-
torial plane towards the pole by ω/Ω. In this case, η = 0.
This solution is very important, because it allows us to
estimate the non-adiabaticity in a general case considered
below. The fraction of the excited state in the wavefunc-
tion is given by:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:28) cos(cid:0) 1

This fraction is complementary to fidelity F = (cid:104)ψψ0(cid:105),
where ψ0 is the ground state in which the system is ex-
pected to remain:

=

fN A + F 2 = 1

(21)

If at t = 0 the spin is not in the position corresponding
to the stationary solution (the equilibrium point ζ = ζeq,
η = 0), it will precess about the equilibrium position,
exactly as the harmonic oscillator with some initial dis-
placement oscillates around the equilibrium point. Since
the system of equations is the same as for the harmonic
oscillator,
its solutions belong to the same family of
curves in the phase space (represented here by θ,η): for
small angles, these are circular orbits around the equi-
librium position, where the radius of the circle is deter-
mined by the energy. For example, if at t = 0 the spin
is in equatorial plane, it will oscillate around the equi-
librium position ζeq = ω/Ω, that is, between ζ = 0 and
ζ = 2ζeq. Its average non-adiabaticity will be given by

fN A =

Angular acceleration and residual non-adiabaticity

magnetic field is changing? Changing the ratio ω/Ω cor-
responds to modification of the equilibrium position of

supplemental material and in the main text: θ (polar angle
of S, ζ (latitude of S), η (difference between the longitudes of
S and Ω), and ξ (angle between S and Ω). Red dashed line
shows the cycloidal spin trajectory.

Equations for spin dynamics in a rotating field

We begin with the precession equation for the spin
dynamics, which can be obtained from the spinor
Schrodinger equation. This equation reads:

= Ω × S

dS
dt

(17)

Here, Ω(t) is the magnetic field vector, which can vary
both in direction and magnitude in the general case, and
S is the spin vector. To be specific, we consider the ro-
tation of the magnetic field in the equatorial plane (a
geodesic trajectory on a sphere). The scheme of the
Bloch sphere with the spin and the magnetic field and
their relative angles is shown in Fig. S5.

Since we are going to study small deviations from the
adiabatic regime, the motion of the spin vector is limited
to small angles close to the equator of the sphere. We can
rewrite the equations using two new variables: the angle
between the spin and the equatorial plane ζ (latitude),
and the azimuthal angle between the spin projection on
this plane and the magnetic field η. These equations
read:

dζ

dt = −Ωη

dt = Ω(cid:0)ζ − ω

dη

Ω

(cid:1)

(18)

Here, Ω is the magnitude of the magnetic field, while ω
is its angular velocity: ω = dφ/dt (φ is the azimuthal

zxqhWSthe harmonic oscillator, which is possible under the ac-
tion of a force. This is not a periodic driving force, con-
trary to the well-known driven damped oscillator prob-
lem, but rather a slowly-varying or stepwise-constant
force.

To make this force appear in the equations, let us in-
troduce a new variable ζ(cid:48) = ζ − ω/Ω. It allows to rewrite
the system of equations as follows:

dt = −Ωη − d
dζ(cid:48)
dt = Ωζ(cid:48)
dη

dt

ω
Ω

(23)

We see that now the term d(ω/Ω)/dt appears in the equa-
tion for the momentum derivative, and therefore it indeed
plays the role of a force, which determines the equilibrium
position. Of course, if a harmonic oscillator is moving (as
a whole) and then suddenly stops, or is not moving and
then suddenly set into motion, this sudden change excites
it and increases the amplitude of its oscillations.

Since the system is not damped, these oscillations can-
not decay, and if the angular velocity of the magnetic
field is slowly reduced to 0, they will remain and pro-
vide a residual non-adiabaticity, which is not exponen-
tially small, but is instead proportional to the derivative
d(ω/Ω)/dt. The fact that if a n-th order derivative of
the perturbation experiences a jump, the final transition
probability (which is the residual non-adiabaticity in our
terms) is not exponential, but proportional to the height
of this jump power n, has been obtained in the 30ies
within the approach of Landau [32] and is quite well-
known, although considered as less interesting than the
exponentially small transition probability for a smooth
perturbation.

In our case, the residual non-adiabaticity will not play
an important role, because it corresponds to oscillations
around the equilibrium position. The contribution of
these oscillations averages out over time and does not
contribute to the wavepacket trajectory (see further sec-
tions).

On the other hand, the equilibrium position ζeq gives a
non-vanishing contribution to the final phase and to the
wavepacket trajectory via Berry curvature. It is there-
fore more important in our case to calculate the equilib-
rium non-adiabaticity as a function of time and to take
into account its effects, than to study the residual non-
adiabaticity (final transition probability), contrary to the
cases considered in the previous works.

Finally, we note that the difference between the exact
extra phase (black) and the analytically found solution
(red) in Fig. 1d of the main text might be due to the
fact that the length of the non-adiabatic cycloidal tra-
jectory is different from the length of the trajectory of
the magnetic field [34].

Averaging for the spinor

In the main text, we calculate the average correction
to the energy due to the deviation of S from Ω. There
are two contributions to the energy correction: one from
the cos θ/2 term in the spinor (that is, from the non-zero
latitude of the spin), which modifies directly the Berry
phase, and one from the magnetic energy term −ΩS,
which can also be integrated into a correction for the
Berry phase, as we shall see.

The energy operator applied on the spinor gives
ω cos2 θ(t)/2, which should be averaged over one preces-
sion period 2π/Ω. The time dependence of θ(t) is found
from the equations for the spin dynamics: it is simply a
harmonic oscillation.

The averaged contribution to the energy reads:

This is the Berry phase plus a part of the non-adiabatic

The magnetic energy also has to be averaged over time.

The angle ξ(t) between S and Ω is given by

which brings together both non-adiabatic corrections to
the Berry phase. While both are important for Fig. 1c,d
of the main text, only the spinor part plays a role for the
wavepacket trajectory (Fig. 4 of the main text), since
the latter is determined by the Berry curvature, as we
will show below.

Semiclassical equations of motion

In 1999, Niu and Sundaram derived the semiclassical
equations of motion of an electron wavepacket in Bloch

bands [6]. Their approach allowed to confirm the anoma-
lous Hall effect predicted by Karplus and Luttinger [5]
and to express this effect in terms of Berry curvature.
Following this approach, we derive our corrected equa-
tions up to the second order in external constant force for
a two-band system using perturbation theory. We con-
sider the case of geodesic trajectory of the wavepacket,
corresponding to the evolution of the effective field on
the equator of the Bloch sphere. We show that in this
configuration, all first-order and most of the second-order
corrections to the semiclassical equations of motion are
zero, except the particular correction due to the differ-
ence of the metric on the equator and at the equilibrium
deviation angle of the spin.

We define the two-band wavepacket wavefunction with

a well defined center of mass position rc by:

(cid:90)

W(cid:105) =

a(k, t)(f0 ψ0k(cid:105) + f1 ψ1k(cid:105))dk

(30)

mentum space centred at k = kc and (cid:82) a(k)2dk = 1.

Where a(k) is the distribution of the wavepacket in mo-

Then, the eigenfunctions of the two bands ψ0,1 (which
are the aligned and anti-aligned states in the effective

field formalism) can be decomposed on the basis of the
Bloch waves:

9

ψik(cid:105) = eik.r ui(cid:105) ,

f02 + f12 = 1

(31)
where ui(cid:105) are the Bloch eigenstates. The effective La-
grangian of the wave packet can then be written as
dt − H)W(cid:105). The Hamiltonian
[6, 48, 49]: L = (cid:104)W (i d
can be expanded around rc using gradient correction in
external electric potential V (the second order gradient
correction is zero since we consider a constant external
force):

H = Hc − e(r − rc).∇V (r)

= Hc − e(r − rc).E

(32)

(33)

Hc is the exact quantum Hamiltonian evaluated at rc

Hc = H0 − eV (rc)

(34)
where H0 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian (H0 ψn(cid:105) =
n ψn(cid:105)).

Let us look on the first term of the Lagrangian:

rc

(35)

where ni,j = ni,j(kc). For a general two-level sys-
tem, we can map the spinor Bloch wave function on
the Bloch sphere. Then, we analyze the configuration
where the wavepacket is moving on a geodesic in momen-
tum space which means that the effective magnetic field
is moving on a great circle (the equator) in the Bloch
sphere picture. A general wave function can be writ-
ten as a superposition of the instantaneous eigenstates
√
which are aligned and anti-aligned with an effective field
(u0,1(cid:105) = 1/

2(e−iφ,±1)T ).

u(cid:105) = f0 u0(cid:105)+f1 u1(cid:105) = (cos θ/2e−i(φ+η), sin θ/2)T (36)

We are interested in the mean correction which is com-
puted by considering the equilibrium position (θ = θeq,
η = 0). In this equilibrium regime, the deviation of the

spin from the magnetic field is constant which means that

dfi
dt

= 0.

(37)

We can hence simplify the previous equation.

connection:

one has

The time derivatives in this expression are to be re-

placed by the derivatives in the parameter space, and an

important step to take into account the non-adiabaticity
correctly, is to keep in the equation the equilibrium devi-
ation of the spin from the magnetic field (i.e. keep track
of the fact that the spin is not on the equator). In order
to do this, using the Bloch sphere picture as discussed in
the main text, we can rewrite:

(cid:104)ui d

uj(cid:105) dss

uj(cid:105) = (cid:104)ui ∂
∂ss

uj(cid:105) dss

(41)
where dss corresponds to the metric of the sphere. For
small non-adiabaticity, the deviation of the spin from the

equator is small and we can expand the correction in
Taylor series:

1/ sin θeq = 1/ sin(π/2 − ζeq) ≈ 1 + ζ 2

eq/2

(42)

(cid:113)

Moreover, we can express ω in term of the quantum

dt = 2 dsq

distance dsq: ω = dφ
. Using
these developments, and the fact that here Ω = 0 − 1
we can write the effective Lagrangian of the wavepacket
in momentum space as:

We can see that the correction term which takes into
account the non-adiabaticity appears in the second or-
der of the momentum derivative. As a consequence, we

need to use perturbation theory up to the second order
in the external force in order to make the computation
self-consistent. These results are well known:

Other terms (like GyyEy) disappear because Ey = 0.
Note, that the indices of the tensor correspond to the
coordinates in the reciprocal space, but are written as
x, y to save space. The "real space" component of the
electric field actually represents the time derivative of the
wave vector as well: Ex = dkx/dt. We need to analyze
each of these two terms. First, we show that the off-
diagonal components of the metric tensor are zero when
the basis vectors are chosen tangential and perpendicular
to the geodesic curve, along which the system propagates.
The first term is therefore zero. Then we show that the
second term is zero as well. The first order contribution
thus disappears.

First-order corrections on geodesics

Metric tensor along geodesic lines

First-order non-adiabatic corrections to the semiclas-
sical equations have been found in the previous works
[23, 53, 54]. Here, we show that these corrections from
the semiclassical equations of motion disappear if the sys-
tem evolves along the geodesic trajectories (for example,
accelerated from zero average initial velocity by a con-
stant force, as in the Hall effect configuration).

We want to analyze the first-order contribution of the
real part of the quantum geometric tensor to the tra-
jectory along the geodesic lines in the parameter space.
This contribution to the dynamical equation reads:

r = k × B(cid:48)

We choose the basis vector xi to be tangential to the

latter means that dxj/dt = 0. Indeed, if we imagine that
a certain object is propagating along the X axis, it nec-
essarily has zero velocity in the perpendicular direction,

otherwise it would not be propagating along X. In this
basis, we have therefore a simplified expression for the
length of the curve:

The latter gives us the residual non-adiabaticity mea-
sured at large wavevectors and times. We see that it
is not exponential in F , but linear, because the con-
figuration of the experiment is different from that of

which is quite natural. We suppose that this paramet-
ric curve is a geodesic one, which means that it has the
smallest possible length. Now, let us consider a curve
which deviates slightly from the geodesic curve: dxj/dt
is not zero, but much smaller than dxi/dt. The fact that
the geodesic curve has the smallest possible length means
that dL is minimized with respect to dxj , and therefore
its derivative should be zero:

(64)

and therefore the first contribution of Eq. (56) is zero.

Transverse derivative of the metric tensor

This contribution to Eq. (56) is also zero along a geodesic
line.

Polariton non-adiabatic evolution

Now, we can apply the new equations to determine the
non-adiabaticity of a polariton wavepacket, accelerated
in combined TE-TM and Zeeman fields. In this case the
total magnetic field energy reads:

(cid:113)

Ω =

∆2 + (βk2)2

(70)

(62)

(63)

When the polaritons propagate in a constant gradient,
their wave vector increases linearly with time: k = F t/,
where the force can be obtained for example by apply-
ing a gradient F = −∇U . The angular velocity of the
rotation of the total magnetic field can be obtained as:

Figure 1 shows the agreement between the nonadia-

simple spin dynamics equation, Eq.
given by the component of the QGT, Eq.
(75) (red
dashed). We see that the latter captures very well the
behavior of the full system, and that the spin dynamics
equation for small angles is sufficiently precise. The fig-
ure is plotted for β = 0.14 meV/µm−2. The inset shows
the residual non-adiabatic fraction fN A,0 (blue) and the
analytical value given by Eq. (74) (red dashed).

Another option to measure the non-adiabaticity could
be to analyze the spectrum of the wavefunction, because
the energy of the ground and excited states is differ-
ent. However, this approach encounters difficulties in
the experimental setting that we propose because of the
spatial gradient which accelerates particles. Indeed, dif-
ferent points of the wavepacket have different potential
energy at a given moment of time. Moreover, since
the wavepacket propagates down the slope, its energy
changes quite rapidly over time. Still, it is possible to use
a time window and see the excited state in the energeti-
cally and spatially resolved emission intensity ψ(x, E)2,
as shown in Fig. S7.

The anomalous Hall effect with Rashba-type SOC (lin-
ear in k) is quite well-known, and the corresponding

Landau-Zener: instead of slowly increasing the perturba-
tion with time (when we approach the "coupling region"
from −∞), we suddenly turn it on at t = 0.

Since the residual non-adiabaticity corresponds to pre-
cession around θeq = 0, it does not contribute to the extra
phase or to the wavepacket trajectory, and does not ap-
pear in the dynamical equations in the main text. For
realistic parameters of microcavities, the residual non-
adiabaticity looks to be inacessible, requiring long prop-
agation distances. Therefore, the expression for the non-
adiabaticity is simplified, and one can write it as:

fN A (k) =

F 2gkk
2Ω2

(75)

We stress that the non-adiabatic fraction and the cor-
responding correction are calculated from the adiabatic
metric.

Experimental measurement of non-adiabaticity

In the precise configuration we consider, the non-
adiabaticity of the wavepacket can be measured via the
diagonal polarization degree. For this, one should orient
the cavity in such a way that the wedge points in the
X direction. Then, the "horizontal" polarization should
be chosen parallel to this X axis. In this case, the adi-
abatic evolution means that the spin rotates from the Z
axis (circular eigenstate at k = 0) to the X pseudospin
axis (horizonal polarization), while the deviation from
this rotation is necessarily towards the Y pseudospin axis
(diagonal polarization).

a)b)3Grad. (µeV/µm)Berry curvature and trajectory (without non-adiabatic
corrections) have been calculated before. This configu-
ration corresponds both to Dirac Hamiltonian describing
an electron in vacuum [50] and to electrons in 2D ma-
terials (like Transitional Metal Dichalcogenides), which
obey to an effective Dirac Hamiltonian [64].

At the same time, the case of k2 TE-TM SOC with
double winding has not been studied, although it is quite
important for photonics. In this section, we present the
detailed results concerning the trajectory of an acceler-
ated wavepacket (under the effect of a force F ) in pres-

ence of the TE-TM SOC and a constant magnetic field
providing Zeeman splitting, solving equations (6) and (9)
of the main text.

We see that increasing the lateral shift requires increasing

The importance non-adiabatic correction can be esti-
mated by the maximal value of the non-adiabatic fraction
fN A behaves as:

fN A,max ∝ β
∆3

(80)

To reduce the maximal non-adiabaticity, it is therefore
important to have a sufficiently large Zeeman splitting ∆.
To have a maximal displacement and a good adiabaticity
at the same time, it is better to increase the TE-TM SOC
β instead of reducing the magnetic field ∆, because the
non-adiabaticity behaves as 1/∆3.
