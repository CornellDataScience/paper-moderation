We study the influence of the polarization angle of linear radiation on the radiation-

induced magnetoresistance oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems, and ex-

amine the polarization immunity on the temperature and quality of the sample. We

have applied the radiation-driven electron orbits model obtaining that the magne-

toresistance is affected by the orientation of the electric field of linearly polarized

radiation when dealing with high quality samples and low temperatures. Yet, for

lower quality samples and higher temperature we recover polarization immunity in

the radiation driven magnetoresistance oscillations. This could be of interest for

future photoelectronics in high quality mesoscopic devices.

Important and unusual properties have been discovered when two-dimensional electron

systems (2DES) are subjected to external AC or DC fields1. We can highlight the recently

measured effect of microwave-induced resistance oscillations (MIRO)2,3 and zero resistance

states (ZRS)2,3. They are obtained when two-dimensional electron systems, in high mobility

samples at low temperature (∼ 1K), are subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field (B)

and radiation (microwave (MW) band) simultaneously. In these experiments, for an increas-

ing radiation power (P ), one first obtains longitudinal magnetoresistance oscillations which

evolve into zero resistance states at high enough P . Early experiments obtained similar

MIRO when radiation is linearly polarized either in the transport direction or perpendicular

to it5. A recent study utilizing a new setup has shown, however, a marked linear polar-

ization sensitivity6,7 Other experiments obtained that the magnetoresistivity response ρxx
is independent of the direction of the circular polarization of radiation4. Some theoretical

contributions8 -- 14 have been presented trying to explain such striking effects but to date,

there is no consensus on the physical origin . In this paper we present a theoretical model

to treat the physical problem of a 2DES subjected simultaneously to a static, moderate

and uniform magnetic field (B) and radiation8,15 linearly polarized at any angle. We study

how the polarization immunity first detected in previous experiments can be altered when

dealing with higher quality samples and lower temperatures. We propose that under such

conditions, radiation-driven magnetoresistance can be affected depending on the different

angles of linearly polarized radiation. The theory and results presented here are important

to understand, more in deep, the coupling between matter and radiation and in the presence

of static B and it could be of interest for the development of future photoelectronics in high

quality mesoscopic devices.

We consider a 2DES (x − y plane) subjected to a perpendicular (z direction), static B, a

DC electric field Edc, responsible of the electron transport through the sample (x direction).

The system is also subjected to linearly polarized MW radiation. The electric field

−→
E (t)

of MW can be in different polarization angles (α) (see Fig. 1). This field is given by:

E (t) = (E0x

vector potential of B, (

m∗(wc/2)2 is the center of the orbit for the electron cycloidal motion, wc is the cyclotron
frequency, Lz is the z-component of the electron total angular momentum. Remarkably, the

exact analytic solution of the Hamiltonian H can be obtained8,15:

Ψ(x, y, t) ∝ φN [(x − X − a(t)), (y − b(t)), t]

(2)

where φN are the well-known Fock-Darwin states16. The most important result with a deep

physical meaning is that, apart from phase factors, the wave function Ψ is proportional to a

Fock-Darwin state where the guiding center of the 2D oscillator is displaced by a(t) in the

x direction and b(t) in the y direction, i.e., describing an approximately circular motion in

the x − y plane. This motion is reflected in the x direction as harmonic oscillatory with the

MW frequency w. The magnitude and nature of this displacement and its physical effects

will depend on the type of the time-dependent force.

The expression for a(t) and b(t) can be obtained for a definite polarization angle of the

MW electric field with respect to the x direction, α,8:

γ is a material and sample-dependent damping factor which dramatically affects the move-

ment of the MW-driven electronic orbits17. Along with this movement interactions occur

between electrons and lattice ions, yielding acoustic phonons and producing a damping ef-

fect in the back and forth electronic orbits motion. This parameter γ is going to play a

crucial role in how the polarization angle affects the magnetoresistance. Now we introduce

the scattering suffered by the electrons due to charged impurities randomly distributed in

the sample8,18. Firstly we calculate the electron-charged impurity scattering rate 1/τ , and

secondly we find the average effective distance advanced by the electron in every scatter-

ing jump: ∆X M W = ∆X 0 + A cos wτ where ∆X 0 is the effective distance advanced when

there is no MW field present. Finally the longitudinal conductivity σxx can be calculated:

, being E is the energy. To obtain ρxx we use the usual tensor relationships

σxx ∝R dE ∆XMW

ρxx = σxx

, where σxy ≃ nie

B and σxx ≪ σxy.

According to our model, the ρxx response under MW excitation is governed by the term

A cos wτ : ρxx ∝ A cos wτ . Therefore we would expect different results of ρxx depending on

the angle α since ρxx depends on α through the amplitude A (see equation 3). However if

the damping factor γ is larger than the MW frequency, γ > w, γ would become the leading

term in the denominator of A. In this situation, γ is able to quench the influence of the

other terms. Therefore similar values are obtained for the amplitude of the orbit center for

different α. For GaAs and typical experimental MW frequencies2,17,19, a value for γ about

1 − 2 × 1012s−1 is enough to obtain a similar ρxx response irrespective of the value of α.

In Fig.2 we show the calculated ρxx as a function of B for linearly polarized radiation and

for different polarization angles. MW frequency w = 90 GHz. ρxx response is practically

immune to the polarization angle, specially for B below cyclotron resonance (see vertical

dashed line, Fig. 2a).

In the same way we would be able to obtain an entirely different scenario lowering

the parameter γ and making the frequency term the leading part in the denominator of

A. We have to remember that the polarization angle α is part of the frequency term in A

and in this new scenario different values of α will be reflected in the frequency term and

eventually in the obtained magnetoresistance. We have developed a microscopical model

for γ8,20 that summarizes the interaction of electron with lattice ions giving rise to acoustic

phonons as:

where Ξ is the acoustic deformation potential, ρ the mass density, kB the Boltzman constant,

the total sum inside brackets is carried out we obtain21 after some algebra:

The latter expression expresses the physical

fact that for high quality samples the

Landau level width gets smaller and in an inelastic scattering event (phonon emission) is

increasingly difficult to find a final Landau state where to get to. Then, the term inside

brackets decreases, when compared to a lower quality samples.

In other words, for high

quality samples , the damping parameter γ will decrease, making increasingly difficult the

damping by acoustic phonon emission and the release of the absorbed energy to the lattice.

Therefore, we have a bottleneck effect for the emission of acoustic phonons. On the other

hand, γ is linear with T and the use of lower temperatures will make smaller the damping

parameter too. Summarizing, the joint effect of high quality samples plus lower tempera-

tures makes possible to reach a situation where the frequency term is more important than

the damping term, (γ < w) making visible a clear effect of the polarization angle on the

magnetoresistance. For GaAs high quality experimental parameters and T < 1K, we obtain

that γ ≃ 1 − 2 × 1011s−1. In Fig. 3 we present calculated magnetoresistivity as a function

of B for linearly polarized radiation with polarization angles α = 0 and α = 90 regarding

the transport direction (x direction). These results correspond to a scenario of high quality

sample and lower temperature (T = 0.7K). We observe that the ρxx polarization immunity

can be clearly altered in function of the angle. This theoretical results have been confirmed

by recent experiments on linearly polarized MW-induced resistance oscillations6,7. We

consider that the results presented here are important to understand the coupling between

matter and radiation when an static B is present and it could be of interest for the

development of future photoelectronic mesoscopic devices.
