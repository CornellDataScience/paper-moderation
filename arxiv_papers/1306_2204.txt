We present the first experimental microwave realization of the one-dimensional Dirac oscillator,
a paradigm in exactly solvable relativistic systems. The experiment relies on a relation of the Dirac
oscillator to a corresponding tight-binding system. This tight-binding system is implemented as a
microwave system by a chain of coupled dielectric disks, where the coupling is evanescent and can
be adjusted appropriately. The resonances of the finite microwave system yields the spectrum of the
one-dimensional Dirac oscillator with and without mass term. The flexibility of the experimental
set-up allows the implementation of other one-dimensional Dirac type equations.

The relativistic version of the harmonic oscillator has
been touched upon occasionally [1, 2], but became a
widely used model for relativistic equations with the ap-
pearance of the seminal paper [3]. Originally it was
known as the Dirac oscillator (DO) [4, 5]. Indeed since
then the number of papers using this model has increased
rapidly, mainly in mathematical physics [6 -- 19], but also
in nuclear physics [20 -- 22], subnuclear physics [23, 24]
and quantum optics [25 -- 28].
In mathematical physics
it has become the paradigm for the construction of co-
variant quantum models with some well determined non-
relativistic limit, but has also attracted much attention
in the environment of exactly solvable models and sym-
metries; it is amusing to mention that even the Higgs
symmetry has been considered in this context [29].

While this model

is a paradigm of mathematical
physics, it does not describe a known physical system,
as is the case for the Dirac equation for the hydrogen
atom. Thus an experimental realization by other means
is highly desirable. There are two proposals to realize
analogue experiments. One in the realm of quantum op-
tics [26 -- 28] and the other one using a classical microwave
setup [30]. In this paper we shall present a microwave re-
alization for the 1-D DO. Beyond its intrinsic interest,
the experiment is also a starting point for further exper-
imental exploration of Dirac-like equations.

We will mainly follow the proposition of Ref. [30] but
use a slightly different mechanism to appropriately take
into account the finiteness of the experimental system.
The experimental idea is based on a mapping of the DO
to a tight-binding model with dimers. In this model it
is important that only nearest neighbor interactions are
present.
It consists of a chain of coupled disks with a
high index of refraction sandwiched between two metal-
lic plates. The coupling constants between the disks have
to be adjusted properly, to obtain a spectrum which is

equivalent to the DO spectrum. This set-up has been
used to investigate the Dirac points [31], disorder effects
[32] and topological transitions in graphene [33]. We start
with a short introduction to the DO and its relation to
a tight-binding Hamiltonian with nearest neighbor cou-
pling only. Thereafter we introduce the experimental
setup and present the experimental results.

Dirac oscillator.- The system that we now call the DO
was proposed more than 20 years ago [3, 34 -- 37], and its
properties and possible applications have been studied
extensively. The original formulation was presented in
Hamiltonian form. Covariance was easily achieved and
the physicality of such a system could be attained by
means of a Pauli coupling [3]. In the present paper we will
use the 1 + 1 dimensional version of the Dirac oscillator
[4], which can be treated analogously and yields a two-
component spinless structure.

The system in question can be conceived in its sim-
plest form by writing the corresponding Hamiltonian as
a function of the spectrum generating algebra. Let a, a†
be the ladder operators of a non-relativistic harmonic os-
cillator and σ± = σx ± iσy the creation and annihilation
operators of spin 1/2 in terms of Pauli matrices. The
1 + 1 dimensional DO Hamiltonian is

H = σ+a + σ−a† + µσz,

where the spectrum is given by

ǫ±,n = ±pn + µ2

(1)

(2)

where the sign denotes particles and antiparticles. The
dimensionless commutator [a, a†] = 1 ensures, that for
a particle of mass m and an oscillator of frequency ω,

we have µ = pmc2/¯hω. Thus in the appropriate units,
variable scales as t 7→ pωmc2/¯ht.

µ gives the mass of the particle directly, and the time
In a certain limit,
the DO can also be reduced to the Weyl equation with

extracted by virtue of the algebraic relation [b, b†] = ∆2.
As before, we have

FIG. 1. A chain of resonators in dimeric configuration, with
atoms of type A and B. The index n stands for the dimer
number, ∆ is the coupling between elements of the same dimer
(intra-dimer coupling, kept constant throughout the array)
and ∆n is the coupling between the right end of dimer n
and the left end of dimer n + 1 (inter-dimer coupling). Have
in mind that here we present the couplings only, later on
∆ ≤ ∆n, which means that in the experiment the intra-dimer
distance is the largest distance in the chain.

a linear potential, thus one may call this system even a
Weyl oscillator. Taking m → 0 leaving mω = constant 6=
0 leads to µ → 0 and the following massless Hamiltonian
(3)

H = σ+a + σ−a†,

with the simplified spectrum

ǫn = ±√n.

(4)

Note here that for n = 0 there is a double degeneracy,
where one of the states is given by −, 0i. Both Hamilto-
nians (2) and (3) can be described within a tight-binding
model with dimers.

Description as a tight-binding model.- The eigenvalue
problem resulting from the Hamiltonian (1) can be writ-
ten as two coupled tight-binding equations of the form

have established that this model can be emulated in a
one-dimensional chain with nearest neighbor interactions
where the spin (± superscripts in the equations above)
can be represented by A and B sites in a linear chain. By
defining the new operators

b = ∆(1 + a),

b† = ∆(1 + a†),

(7)

the Hamiltonian for a tight-binding chain of two species
can be written as

Hchain = σ+b + σ−b† + µσz

(8)

and µ is now the energy difference between the resonances
sitting upon A and B sites giving rise to a spectral gap.
The constant ∆ is nothing else than the coupling be-
tween two sites, and the spectrum of the system can be

ǫn = ±p∆2n + µ2

(9)

The map between the DO and the coupled linear chain of
two species is therefore quite natural. Finally we can see
that the resulting array comprises dimers AB, e.g. sites
A is always equally coupled to site B by ∆ independently
on n, whereas the coupling between the dimers ∆n has
to follow a specific law derived below. The requirements
for a realization of b, b†, on the other hand, introduce
the following restrictions: For the inter-dimer coupling
∆n = ∆√n.

An appropriate cut-off.- Till now we assumed a semi-
infinite array which terminates at one end with the value
∆0 = 0 (no more dimers to the left). Therefore, couplings

of the form √n range from 0 to limn→∞ ∆n = ∞. How-

ever, experimentally accessible couplings always have an
upper limit ∆sup determined by the physical situation
and such a restriction introduces a natural cut-off in the
array by means of the relation ∆sup = ∆√nsup. Thus we
arrive at a finite chain with a total number 2nsup of sites.
A previously proposed finite realization [30], although
well conceived for the infinite case, did not take into ac-
count cut-off effects appropriately. Any configurations of
type b = ∆a + δ for arbitrary δ fulfills the algebraic re-
lations, but to keep edge effects small δ must be smaller
than any other coupling in the system. Choosing δ = ∆
is sufficient for this purpose. The preferred tight-binding
models are such that the successive couplings are in-
creased till a maximal coupling is reached, which is in
contrast with the previous proposition.

∼ ∆min. Numerical inspection of the tight-

The generation of mass.- Our scheme so far contem-
plates the appearance of a spectral gap corresponding
to a finite mass in the DO to result from an inherent
asymmetry within the dimer, i.e. A and B have different
eigenenergies. This produces the term µσz in the Hamil-
tonian [eq. (1)]. However, in practice an alternate option
to generate a gap occurs due to finite size effects: We
choose the smallest inter-dimer coupling to be slightly
smaller, rather than equal to the intra-dimer coupling,
i.e. ∆′ >
binding model shows that, while a gap opens, the effects
on the relative position of the eigenvalues on both sides
of the gap have finite size errors similar to the ones in
the gapless case. Note that the gap depends on the num-
ber of sites and vanishes as this number goes to infinity;
therefore a large array will not describe a DO with mass,
in compliance with the chiral symmetry of the system
[38]. Yet for finite sizes we do get the desired spectrum
and we can make appropriate aproximations or numeri-
cal calculations in the tight-binding model to explain this
satisfactorily. Nevertheless we suggest to adapt the gap
size to the experimental one rather than to get it from a
tight-binding model as there will always remain discrep-
ancies between the model and the experiment, which are

one changes the inter-disk couplings and obtains the 1D-
DO.

For the sake of simplicity let us assume an exponential
law which is a good approximation of the coupling in
terms of the distance in the range of interest. Then the
distances dn between the dimers in the massless case are

entirely unrelated to the DO. If we wish to take advan-
tage of this finite size effect we should thus replace eq. (8)
by

exp,

(10)

where µexp refers to the parameter determined by the
experiment.

Experimental results.- For the experimental realiza-
tion of the DO we use the techniques that have been
developed to investigate the band structure of graphene
[31 -- 33]. The realization of the DO is achieved as tight-
binding system with nearest neighbor coupling and small
higher order ones. A set of identical dielectric cylindrical
disks (5 mm height, 4 mm radius and a refractive index
of about 6) is placed between two metallic plates (see
fig. 2). Close to one disk we placed a kink antenna con-
nected to a vectorial network analyzer allowing to ex-
cite both transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse elec-
tric (TE) modes. The individual disks have an isolated
TE resonance at 6.65 GHz. Restricting our investigation
to frequencies around this value, where each disk con-
tributes only one resonance. The electromagnetic field
for this TE mode is mostly confined within the disks and
spreads evanescently outside. A sketch of the experimen-
tal setup is shown in fig. 2 and a detailed description is
presented in ref. [32].

In contrast to refs. [31, 32] we adjusted the height be-
tween the two plates to h=13 mm, to reduce the higher
order neighbor couplings. The coupling parameter ∆
between two adjacent disks depends on the distance
between centers of the disks d and can be given in
terms of a modified Bessel function K02, as described
in [31, 32]. Thus, by changing the distance between disks,

(11)

The intra-dimer distance is d and we chose d1 = d. The
distances between the dimers are decreasing monotoni-
cally, thus the smallest possible distance dinf determined
by the diameter of the disks dD defines the largest pos-
sible coupling ∆sup and the largest allowable number of
dimers nsup giving the largest admissible size of our dimer
chain. The number of energy levels is therefore equal to
2nsup. The eigenfrequencies for the 1D-DO without mass
is then given by

νn = νc ± ∆√n,

(12)

where νc is the eigenfrequency of a single disk. We used
an intra-dimer distance d of 13, 14 and 15 mm and chains
of 12, 18, 24 and 30 disks. In fig. 3 we show the reflec-
tion spectra for d=13 mm and 30 disks for two different
antenna positions. The height of the resonances depends
on the antenna site, as it is proportional to the inten-
sity of the wavefunction at the disk. By measuring at
different sites it is possible to extract all resonance po-
sitions. The vertical lines correspond to the theoretical
predictions and a good agreement is found. Deviations
increase at the edges of the spectrum, as designed by the
choice of the cutoff.

We now investigate the dependence on the chain
length. The measured eigenfrequencies as a function of
the mode number is shown in fig. 4. The continuous
curve corresponds to the analytical prediction (12). As
the number of dimers increases, we find that the low lev-
els are best reproduced by the theoretical curve (12) and
the point of departure from theory moves further away
from the center of the spectrum as the number of dimers
increases. For dimer distances of 14 and 15 mm we got
similar results. Thus we experimentally measured the
spectrum of the Dirac oscillator without mass in a finite
approximation.

As we only have disks of the same type, meaning hav-
ing approximately the same resonance frequency, we can-
not directly generate the 1D-DO with mass as originally
introduced. But, as mentioned above, for a finite chain
one can introduce a mass term by setting the intra-dimer
coupling ∆′ larger than the smallest coupling between
the dimers ∆min. Thus we only have to set the intra-
dimer distance d to be smaller than the maximal inter-
dimer distance d1. We used a chain of 15 dimers with
an initial inter-dimer distance d1=15 mm and a smallest
inter-dimer distance d14 = dmin ≈10.81. As intra-dimer
distances d we choose 10, 11, and 12 mm. In fig. 5 we
present the reflection spectra and the theoretical predic-
tion (eq. (2)) for d=10 mm. We observe the expected
gap at the center and find a good agreement for the reso-
nances close to the gap. Again the outer resonances show

FIG. 6. Dirac oscillator with mass for different number of
dimers, where the last dimers are removed. The intra-dimer
distance is d=10 mm. Displayed are 6 (dmin ≈12.32 mm, Cir-
cles), 9 (dmin ≈11.61 mm, squares), 12 (dmin ≈11.15 mm, di-
amonds), and 15 (dmin ≈10.81 mm, triangles). Additionally
the corresponding theoretical curves resulting from (9) are

larger deviations. Next we removed step by step the last
dimer, thus increasing the minimal inter-dimer distance
dmin starting with dinf .

In fig. 6 the resonances for different chain lengths are
shown. We observe a good agreement for the upper spec-
trum with eq. (2). The two bands behave slightly differ-
ently, especially their width is different, due to the sec-

ond nearest neighbor couplings, as was also observed in
square and graphene lattices [39]. Furthermore the gap
is observed to increase monotonically with dmin.

In conclusion, we have experimentally realized the 1-D
DO based on the correspondence of the DO to a tight-
binding model. Within this model effects of finite size
are small at the center of the spectrum. Furthermore,
we have produced a gap in the spectrum which can be
interpreted as the mass of the fermion. This was done
by a distortion that applies only to finite arrays, as the
infinite limit of the system makes such a gap vanish. We
hope for the future to investigate wavefunctions and pulse
propagation as well. Both are accessible for the setup if
one uses a movable antenna with an additionally fixed
antenna and measure the transmission [33, 39]. Addi-
tionally we would like to realize a 2D-DO as mentioned in
Ref. [30]. The model assumes a logarithmically deformed
hexagonal lattice with only nearest neighbor couplings.
To respect this coupling condition a realization of the 2-
D DO is not possible with our distance-coupling relation.
However, microwave graphs seems to be a promising can-
didate [40, 41].
