We study the magnetic field response of the Majorana Kramers pairs of a one-dimensional time-reversal
invariant (TRI) superconductors (class DIII) with or without a coexisting chirality symmetry. For unbroken TR
and chirality invariance the parameter regimes for nontrivial values of the (Z2) DIII-invariant and the (Z) chiral
invariant coincide. However, broken TR may or may not be accompanied by broken chirality, and if chiral
symmetry is unbroken, the pair of Majorana fermions (MFs) at a given end survives the loss of TR symmetry
in an entire plane perpendicular to the spin-orbit coupling field. Conversely, we show that broken chirality may
or may not be accompanied by broken TR, and if TR is unbroken, the pair of MFs survives the loss of broken
chirality.
In addition to explaining the anomalous magnetic field response of all the DIII class TS systems
proposed in the literature, we provide a realistic route to engineer a "true" TR-invariant TS, whose pair of MFs
at each end is split by an applied Zeeman field in arbitrary direction. We also prove that, quite generally, the
splitting of the MFs by TR-breaking fields in TRI superconductors is highly anisotropic in spin space, even in
the absence of the topological chiral symmetry.

Introduction: Majorana fermions (MF), quantum zero en-
ergy particles with operators γ = γ†, are particles which can
be identified with their own anti-particles [1 -- 3]. Because of
their non-local topological nature they have been proposed to
be useful in potential implementation of fault-tolerant quan-
tum computation [4, 5]. Although MFs were first predicted
in the context of high energy physics [1], in low tempera-
ture systems they have been recently proposed as emergent
quasi-particles in fractional quantum Hall systems [6, 7], 2D
[7] and 1D [4] spinless p-wave superconductors, naturally-
occurring chiral p-wave superconductors such as strontium
ruthenate [8], and systems closely analogous to spinless p-
wave superconductors such as heterostructures of topological
insulators (TI) and s-wave superconductors [9], cold fermion
systems with Rashba spin orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and
an attractive s-wave interaction [10, 11], and also, most re-
cently, heterostructures of spin-orbit coupled semiconductor
thin films [12 -- 14] and nanowires [14 -- 16] proximity coupled
to s-wave superconductors and a Zeeman field. There have
been recent claims of experimental observation of MFs in the
semiconductor heterostructure, attracting considerable atten-
tion [17 -- 27]. In concurrent developments, recent work [28 -- 
30] has established that the quadratic Hamiltonians describing
gapped TI and topological superconductors (TS) can be clas-
sified into 10 distinct topological symmetry classes each of
which can be characterized by a topological invariant. Ac-
cording to this classification, the experimentally investigated
semiconductor heterostructures are in the topological sym-
metry class D with MFs protected by the particle-hole (p-h)
symmetry Ξ (ΞHkΞ−1 = −H−k where Hk is the quadratic
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian).

Recently, a completely different class of 1D time reversal
(TR) invariant topological superconductors (in class DIII) has
been proposed where a pair of MFs exist on each end of a
quantum wire [31, 33 -- 39]. Even though a pair of zero energy
states are localized at the same end, they are protected against
hybridization (and acquiring finite energies) by the TR sym-

metry. These systems are characterized by a DIII class Z2
invariant which takes a non-trivial value (indicating the exis-
tence of the pair of MFs at the same end) when the pairing
potential has a negative sign on an odd number of Fermi sur-
faces each of which encloses a TR-invariant momenta [40].
In Ref. [36] this is achieved by having a quantum wire with
Rashba spin-orbit coupling proximity coupled to an uncon-
ventional s± wave superconductor with the superconducting
pair potential ∆k changing sign between the two Fermi sur-
faces.
In the appropriate parameter regime the presence of
the non-trivial value of the Z2 invariant implies that no pertur-
bation respecting the TR symmetry can remove the MF pair
from the wire ends without closing the bulk gap. Conversely,
it is expected that perturbations that do break the TR symme-
try can split the pair of MFs to higher energies by hybridiza-
tion. Surprisingly, however, in all the examples of the DIII
class TS systems proposed in the literature so far, the pair of
MFs at each end continues to exist even in the presence of TR-
breaking Zeeman fields in some directions in the spin space.
In this paper we first show that 1D TR-invariant (TRI) TS
systems in class DIII frequently possess a co-existing chiral
symmetry allowing to define an integer Z topological invari-
ant in addition to the DIII class Z2 invariant. For unbroken TR
invariance the parameter regimes for nontrivial values of the
Z2 invariant and the Z invariant coincide, each indicating the
presence of the Kramers pair of MFs. However, broken TR
may not be accompanied by broken chirality, and if the chiral
symmetry is unbroken, the pair of MFs at a given end can sur-
vive the loss of the TR symmetry. We show that, in this way,
the existence of the chiral symmetry explains the persistence
of the MFs even in the presence of magnetic fields in a plane
perpendicular to the spin-orbit coupling (the chiral symmetry
was used earlier to explain the robustness of the zero modes to
Zeeman fields in a specific direction in spin space in Rashba-
coupled d-wave superconductors [32, 33]. Conversely, we
find that broken chirality may also not be accompanied by
broken TR symmetry, and in this case also the MFs remain un-

split due to the persistence of the Z2 invariant. By numerically
solving the appropriate BdG equations for a s±-wave TRI su-
perconductor we find that only those physical perturbations
that simultaneously break both TR and chiral symmetries can
hybridize the MFs and split them to finite energies. In addi-
tion to solving the problem of the anomalous magnetic field
response of all the DIII class TS systems proposed in the liter-
ature so far [33 -- 39] (we have checked that analysis similar to
what follows applies to all of them), our results also provide
a realistic route to engineer a "true" TR-invariant topological
superconductor whose Majorana Kramers pairs are split by an
applied Zeeman field in any direction. However, even in this
case, and quite generally in TRI superconductors, we prove
that the splitting of the MFs by TR-breaking Zeeman fields
is highly anisotropic in spin space, and this can be taken as a
"smoking-gun" signature of TRI superconductivity and Majo-
rana Kramers pairs.

Theoretical model and topological invariant: Let us con-
sider a TR-invariant topological superconductor given by the
kHkΨk

following mean field BdG Hamiltonian H = Pk Ψ†

where,

Hk = (ǫk − µ)σ0τz + αR

k (a · σ)τz + ∆s

kσ0τx

(1)

where ǫk = −2t cos(k) is the single particle kinetic energy,
k = αR sin k is the Rashba-type spin orbit interaction, and
αR
k = ∆0 + ∆1 cos(k) represents the spin-singlet supercon-
∆s
ducting pair potential with a conventional s-wave order pa-
rameter (∆0) and a s± [36] or d-wave component ([33]) (∆1).
The matrices σi,τi indicate spin 1/2 Pauli matrices in the spin
and the particle-hole spaces, respectively, and we have used
the Nambu basis, Ψk = (ck↑, ck↓, c†
−k↑)T . The vec-
tor a indicates an arbitrary spin orbit coupling direction in
the spin space. Selecting a along y, Eq. (1) reduces to the
1D Hamiltonian used in [36]. We solve the corresponding
lattice BdG equations for a finite wire setup, and find zero
energy quasiparticle modes which satisfy the Majorana con-
dition (γ† = γ) for the second quantized operators γi. The
wavefunctions for the zero energy modes are localized at the
wire ends which is illustrated in Fig. 1 panel (a). The MFs
exist for the chemical potential satisfying µ < 2αR, as seen
in panel (b), corresponding to the range for which the Z2 TR
invariant takes a non-trivial value [36].

In addition to the particle hole symmetry, with the operator
Ξ = σyτyK, the above Hamiltonian satisfies the TR condition
ΘHkΘ−1 = H−k with the TR operator Θ = iσyτ0K where K
is the complex conjugation operator. For the parameter range
µ < 2αR the TR Z2 topological invariant has a non-trivial
value and the system constitutes a topological superconductor
with a pair of MFs localized at each end of the nanowire. Note
however, that there exists an operator O = (a·y+i(a×y)·σ)K
with O2 = 1 which acts on the Hamiltonian similarly to the
TR operator, OHkO−1 = H−k. Due to the existence of O
and the presence of Ξ, there exists a chiral operator which is
simply the product S2 = O · Ξ = (a · σ)τy. The opera-
tor S2 anti-commutes with the Hamiltonian, {Hk, S2} = 0
which can be easily shown by explicitly operating with Ξ and

cle and hole character satisfying the Majorana condition. (b) The low

(µ < 2αR, non-trivial regime) winds about the origin twice as k is
varied through the Brillouin zone yielding a chiral invariant W = 2.
Upon increasing the chemical potential, the blue curve (µ > 2αR
topologically trivial regime) winds about the origin 0 times indicat-
ing a decrease in the chiral invariant from W = 2 to W = 0 which
is consistent with the disappearance of the MFs in (b) as well as the
TR-invariant Z2 value.

then O on Hk. Note that it is trivial to show that the operator
S1 = σ0τy also anti-commutes with the BdG Hamiltonian as
σ0 (τy) commutes (anti-commutes) with each term in Eq. (1).
However, invariants calculated with this operator (see below)
are inconsistent with the behavior of the BdG spectrum and
we note that S1, S2 form a two dimensional vector space of
chiral operators anti-commuting with Hk.

The existence of the S2 symmetry allows us to compute an
integer Z chiral invariant which counts the number of topo-
logically protected MFs at each end of the wire. Because of
the anti-commutation relation between the chirality operator
and Hk, the BdG Hamiltonian takes the off-diagonal form in

FIG. 2. (Color online) (a) Winding curves for the bulk BdG Hamil-
tonian given by Eqs.
(1,4) which preserves the chiral symmetry
(b ⊥ a). The red, blue, and green curves yield chiral invariants
W = 2, 1, 0 connected by gap closures and topological phase transi-
tions. (b) Low energy BdG quasiparticle spectrum corresponding to
the winding curves in panel (a). The chiral invariant gives the number
of topologically protected MF modes at each end of the nanowire.

The integer W counts the number of times the angle θ(k)
winds about the origin in the complex plane. This quantity
is invariant under smooth deformations and cannot change
without Det(Ak) going to zero, indicating a gap closing and
topological phase transition. As shown in Fig. 1 panel (c)
the winding number in the regime (µ < 2αR) is 2, while
in the topologically trivial regime the winding number be-
comes 0. This corresponds exactly with the parameter regime
for which the DIII class Z2 invariant takes a non-trivial value
[33, 36]. Thus in the non-trivial topological regime the Hamil-
tonian given by Eq. (1) is characterized by the coexistence of
TR and chiral symmetries.
In the following discussion we
investigate the behavior of the Majorana Kramers pair while
breaking one symmetry and maintaining the other, and finnaly
in the presence of terms which destroy both symmetries.

TR-breaking perturbations maintaining chirality invari-
ance: We consider the effect of TR-breaking perturbations
such as Zeeman splitting in an arbitrary direction on the low
energy BdG spectrum for a finite wire. The Zeeman splitting
is written as,

HZ = V (b · σ)τ0.

(4)

The total BdG Hamiltonian is a sum of Eq. (1) and this term.
Note that for b ⊥ a this term anti-commutes with S2, pre-
serving the chiral symmetry of the system. As expected, the
MFs are topologically protected and immune to splitting by
Zeeman fields in the two directions (and on the entire plane
formed by them) perpendicular to the spin-orbit field. Increas-
ing the magnitude of the splitting removes one Fermi surface
and the system is driven through a topological quantum phase
transition into a state which is effectively a spin-less p-wave
superconductor, characterized by one MF at each end of the
wire. Further increasing the Zeeman splitting removes the
second Fermi surface driving the system into a phase asso-
ciated with no MFs. At each of these topological phase transi-
tions the chiral invariant W decreases by one from W = 2 to
W = 1 and finally W = 0 as seen in Fig. 2 panel (a). Panel

(b) shows the low energy BdG spectrum with parameters cor-
responding to those used for the winding curves. Thus, in
the presence Zeeman splitting discussed above, it is appropri-
ate to classify the system as a chiral topological superconduc-
tor with an integer Z invariant characterizing the topological
phase. Note that a Zeeman splitting b k a commutes with S2,
breaking both TR and chiral symmetries. In this case the MFs
do in fact couple as a result of the broken symmetries and the
zero energy modes are split to finite energy (Fig. [3], panel
(a)).

TR-
invariance: Conversely, we consider terms in the BdG
Hamiltonian which break the chiral symmetry while pre-
serving TR-symmetry. For example, one may examine the
response of the zero energy modes to the inclusion of a
TR-invariant next nearest neighbor spin-orbit coupling. In the
absence of Zeeman splitting the total Hamiltonian is written
as a sum of Eq. (1) and

HSO′

k = α′ sin(2k)(c · σ)τz.

(5)

Here the vector c indicates the axis of the next-nearest neigh-
bor spin-orbit coupling. Regardless of this direction Eq. 5
respects the TR condition, ΘHkΘ−1 = H−k. If c k a the
spin-orbit coupling has a fixed axis and the chiral S2 sym-
metry is maintained as well. In this case, the results of the
preceding section are applicable and the MFs are robust to the
application of magnetic fields in the plane perpendicular to
a. However, for c ⊥ a, the extra spin-orbit coupling com-
mutes with S2, breaking the chiral symmetry. Physically, the
next-nearest neighbor spin-orbit coupling corresponds to the
spin quantization axis being different at the different spin-split
fermi points. Such a difference in spin-polarizations between
the two fermi points is natural in the limit where the fermi
points are sufficiently separated to allow a different sign of
the pairing potential. Since such a difference in sign in the pair
potential between the two spin-split Fermi points is achieved
in the topological regime (µ < 2αR) [36] the next-nearest
neighbor spin-orbit coupling is expected in this regime. Since
the perturbation HSO′ does not break time-reversal symmetry,
Kramers theorem dictates that Majorana fermions can only
occur in Kramers pairs and a single Kramers pair of Majorana
modes at either of the ends of the nanowire cannot be split by
HSO′.

Zeeman splitting in a spin-nonconserving time reversal
Hamiltonian: construction of a "true" TR-protected topolog-
ical superconductor: The addition of the HSO′ to break the
chiral symmetry leads to a topological state in which spin is
not conserved. (Note that, in the absence of such a term the
spin operator a · σ commutes with the Hamiltonian whereby
this component of spin is conserved.) We find that the addition
of HSO′, which has no chiral symmetry but is TR-invariant,
leads to a Kramers pair of MFs that are split by Zeeman split-
ting in all directions. However, as argued below, even in this
general time-reversal invariant case, where no chiral symme-
try is present, the splitting of the MFs at small Zeeman fields
is still highly anisotropic in spin space, and this property can

be used as a diagnostic signature of Majorana-Kramers pairs
in experiments.

To understand the splitting in more detail, we consider the
response of the MFs on the right end of the wire to an applied
magnetic field. To simplify the situation we assume that the
MFs on the left end have been gapped out by a localized mag-
netic field, which does not affect the right end of the wire. The
splitting and crossing of the MFs on the right end as a function

of the magnetic field V = Pa=x,y,z Baσa can be analyzed by

studying the Pfaffian of the BdG Hamiltonian

Q(B) = P f (σyτyHBdG(B)),

(6)

where we have taken advantage of the fact
that based
on particle-hole symmetry of HBdG, σyτyHBdG is anti-
symmetric and allows the definition of a Pfaffian. The Pfaffian
Q defined here is related to the Majorana number defined by
Kitaev [4], and therefore corresponds to the fermion parity
of the ground state. More importantly, Hermiticity of HBdG
dictates that Q(B) is real and since Q(B)2 = Det(HBdG),
Q(B) can only change sign when an odd number of pairs
of energy levels cross zero-energy. Therefore, in our system,
where only the energy levels on the right side can cross zero-
energy when a small B is applied, the splitting and crossing
of MFs is determined by Q(B). The MFs are unsplit only
when Q(B) = 0. Since the MFs are unsplit at B = 0,
Q(B = 0) = 0. Applying the time-reversal operator iσyK
to Eq. (6) we observe that Q(B)2 = Q(−B)2. This allows
two choices Q(B) = ±Q(−B) where only the case with the
− sign corresponds to having an odd number of MFs that are
split by the Zeeman field. This case corresponds to the Z2
non-trivial TRI superconductor so that in this case Q satisfies

Q(B) = −Q(−B).

(7)

At small B, one can expand Q(B) as

Q(B) = Xa

[ρaBa{1 +Xb,c

ρabcBbBc(1 +Xd,f

(ρabcdf BdBf

+ . . . )}],

(8)

where ρa, ρabc, and ρabcdf are coefficients that in principle
can be determined in perturbation theory.

Using Eq. 8, we note that there is a unique direction b1 par-
allel to ρ, where the MFs split linearly as long as B is not
in the plane perpendicular to b1. This is similar to the chiral
case where the Zeeman potential is applied along the axis of
the spin-orbit field. The existence of a unique axis with such a
strong splitting of MFs is a general feature of the TR-invariant
state. In general the MF splitting when B is in the plane per-
pendicular to ρ is of order B 3. However, varying B along the
circle with B · ρ = 0 and B held fixed we conclude that
since Q(B) is odd in B, the splitting must vanish at some
point on the circle. Along this direction b3, the cubic coeffi-
cient also vanishes and the splitting of the MFs is expected to
be even slower i.e. of order B 5. The splitting in the perpen-
dicular direction b2 = b1 × b3 is of order B 3. By considering

with strength α′ = α, and calculating numerically the MF
energies in the plane perpendicular to the direction where the
MFs split linearly, we see in Fig. 3 that the MFs in this model
split in all directions.

In conclusion, We study the magnetic field response of
the Majorana kramers pairs of one-dimensional TRI super-
conductors with or without a coexisting chirality symme-
try. When the chiral symmetry is present, in addition to TR,
the Majorana Kramers pairs are topologically robust to TR-
breaking fields on a plane perpendicular to the spin-orbit cou-
pling. Apart from explaining the anomalous magnetic field re-
sponse of all the DIII class systems proposed in the literature
[33 -- 39] (for instance, the chiral operator for the Hamiltonian
in Ref. [35] is S2 = szσ0τy, where σi(si) is a Pauli matrix
in channel (spin) space), we provide a realistic route to engi-
neer a "true" TRI TS system whose Majorana Kramers pairs
are split by a Zeeman field applied in any direction. However,
even in this case, and quite generally in TRI superconductors,
we prove that the splitting of the MFs is highly anisotropic in
spin space, which can be used in experiments as a "smoking-
gun" signature of Majorana Kramers pairs.
