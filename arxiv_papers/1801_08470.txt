We study the response of a conical metallic surface to an external electromagnetic (EM) field by
representing the fields in basis functions containing integrable singularities at the tip of the cone. A
fast analytical solution is obtained by the conformal mapping between the cone and a round disk.
We apply our calculation to the scattering- based scanning near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM)
and successfully quantify the elastic light scattering from a vibrating metallic tip over a uniform
sample. We find that the field-induced charge distribution consists of localized terms at the tip
and the base and an extended bulk term along the body of the cone far away from the tip.
In
recent s-SNOM experiments at the visible-IR range (600nm - 1µm) the fundamental is found to be
much larger than the higher harmonics whereas at THz range (100µm − 3mm) the fundamental
becomes comparable to the higher harmonics. We find that the localized tip charge dominates the
contribution to the higher harmonics and becomes bigger for the THz experiments, thus providing
an intuitive understanding of the origin of the near-field signals. We demonstrate the application
of our method by extracting a two-dimensional effective dielectric constant map from the s-SNOM
image of a finite metallic disk, where the variation comes from the charge density induced by the
EM field.

Scattering-type near-field optical microscope

(s-
SNOM) has made great advances over the past decade
by combining the well-developed atomic force micro-
scope (AFM) techniques with a wide range of tunable
and broadband light sources. By gathering the scat-
tered light from an AFM tip (see Fig. 1a), s-SNOM
effectively probes the near-field interactions between the
nanometer-sized tip apex and the sample surface, pro-
viding a spatial resolution of 10 nm, far beyond the
diffraction limit of traditional optics[1, 2]. It has shown
to be extremely useful in probing phase inhomogeneities
in strongly correlated electron materials[3 -- 8], polari-
tonic waves in 2D materials[9 -- 11], charge concentra-
tions in semiconductor nanostructures[12 -- 14] and molec-
ular nano-fingerprints in organic and soft materials[15 -- 
17]. The central task of quantitatively understanding
the near-field signals comes down to solving a non-
trivial scattering problem, of which light of frequency
ω elastically scatters from a cone-shaped AFM tip os-
cillating vertically on the sample surface at the me-
chanical resonance frequency Ω << ω of the can-
tilever. Approaches from simple models such as the point
dipole[18] and rp models[19] to state-of-the-art finite ele-
ment calculations[20] have been applied to this problem.
Because of the singularity at the tip, current approaches
have not been able to consistently predict the phase of
the signal accurately (See Fig. 3 below). We find that
the inverse extraction of the physical properties of the
sample from the scattering data with current numerical
approaches does not always produce unique results.
It
is also extremely time consuming to solve the problem
without simplifying approximation and this has limited
the reliable real time interpretation of the experimental
data.

Here we overcame the difficulty of the singularity at
the apex by using our recently developed technique[25 -- 
27] of representing the fields in basis functions containing
integrable singularities at the tip obtained by conformal
mapping between the cone and a round disk and suc-
cessfully quantify the elastic light scattering from a vi-
brating metallic tip. We found the field-induced charge
distribution to consist of a bulk term along the body of
the cone far away from the tip and localized terms at the
tip apex and the base. The scattering at the fundamen-
tal frequency ω + Ω comes from both the bulk and the
localized charges. The near field higher harmonics at fre-
quencies ω +nΩ experimentally observed is dominated by
contributions from the localized charge at the tip. In re-
cent s-SNOM experiments at the optical to mid infrared
range[2] and in the THz range (> 1mm) the fundamental
is much larger than and comparable to the higher har-
monics respectively. Our calculation is in agreement with
the empirical measurements where we found that the tip
charge at THz frequencies is much larger than that at
IR frequencies. To mimic the conical AFM tip, there
have been work with different less singular tip geome-
tries such as the spherical[18], the spheroidal[21 -- 23] and
the pear-shaped[24]. These calculations implied differ-
ent induced charge distributions. Our approach provides
a more systematic way to calculate the charge distribu-
tions for different experimental conditions.

Our calculation is also orders of magnitude faster than
current approaches and makes this study suitable for ef-
ficiently calculating the near-field signals and tip-sample
interactions over a wide range of frequencies all the way
from visible to terahertz with a fast and effective theoret-
ical treatment. We demonstrate the back-extraction of a
two-dimensional map from the s-SNOM image of a finite

metallic disk which effectively quantify the charge den-
sity of a finite metallic surface induced by an EM field.
We now described our results in detail.

FIG. 1: (a) Schematic representation of the scattering near-
field setup. (b) Schematics of the conformal mapping of the
cone shaped tip to a round disk.

We are interested in the current flow on a finite film
caused by an external electromagnetic (EM) wave. We
assume that the film is thin enough that there is no cur-
rent in the direction perpendicular to it. The current
density j in the presence of an external electric field Eext
is governed by the equation

ρj + Eem = Eext.

(1)

where ρ is the resistivity, Eem is the electromagnetic field
generated by the current.We impose the boundary con-
dition of no current flow perpendicular to the boundary
of the film with a large boundary resistivity ρs which we
take to approach infinity[25 -- 27]. The total resistivity ρ
is a sum of this boundary term and a metal resistivity
ρ0.

Because of the singularity at the tip, it is difficult to
treat the problem. Here we represent the currents and
the fields not in terms of finite elements on a mesh but
in terms of a complete set of orthonormal basis functions
with the integrable singularity of the system built in.
This rigorous approach was shown to be very efficient[25 -- 
27]. For the simple case of an annnulus of radii R1, R2,
the basis functions are the well known vector cylindrical
functions[26, 27] Mm Nmof angular momentum m and
with components Xr and XΦ (X=M, N) in the radial
and the angular directions. Here we are interested in a
conical film of height h, base radius a with the cone angle
θ = tan−1 a/h, thickness t and a small flat tip of radius b.
This geometry is closest to the experimental setup among
all the theoretical models. A point on the conical surface
and a point inside the annulus are characterized by the
cylindrical coordinates r and φ and R and Φ respectively.
As is illustrated in Fig. 1b, these can be mapped into
each other via a conformal harmonic map[28]

function of a circular annulus as

cX(r) = α {Xr[R(r)]e1 + XΦe2}

(2)

where X = M, N , α = 1/J 1/2 = R/r. The tangent vec-
tors on the surface of the cone are in the cylindrical basis
(r, φ, z): e1 = 1/(1 + h2)1/2er − h/(1 + h2)1/2ez, e2 = eφ
With this choice, the new basis functions are orthonormal
with the corresponding measure: R d2r(cXn)∗ · cYm =
R d2RJα2Xn · Ym = δX,Y .

The electromagnetic field Eem can be represented as
Eem = Z0j where the "impedance" matrix Z0 is just the
representation of the Green's function in this basis[25 -- 
27]. Just as in our previous studies, when the basis func-
tions are orthonormal, the off-diagonal elements of the
impedance matrix is much less than the diagonal ele-
ments. Furthermore the magnitude of the impedance in-
creases rapidly. These greatly facilitate the convergence
of the solution and provide for a much better understand-
ing of the physics.

In this notation, the circuit equation becomes

Zj = Eext + Es

(3)

where Z = Z 0 + ρ0. The boundary electric field Es is
the product of the normal component of the current at
the boundary js and ρs, i.e. Es = jsρs . They behave
like Lagrange multipliers. Their values are determined
from the condition that the normal boundary currents
become zero. Physically, as the external field is applied,
the current is stopped at the boundary and charges of
surface density σs are getting accumulated. A boundary
field is generated until it reaches a value to oppose further
current arriving there.

In the experiment, there is an additional sample sur-
face of dielectric constant ǫ underneath the cone. The
EM field induced charges of density n on the surafce. In
the presence of the plane at a distance d = d0(1−cos Ωt)+
dm from the tip, there will be image charges of density
ni(r − 2dez) = −βn(r), β = (ǫ − 1)/(ǫ + 1). Because d
is much less than the wavelength the method of images
is a good approximation. The total EM field now has
additional contributions from the image charges. The ef-
fective impedance Z is modified. We have calculated the
additional image circuit parameters and included them
in the circuit equations.

Because of the image charge, the tip surface field Es2 =
Esa+Esb is now a sum of a field Esa from a surface charge
of density σs at the tip and a field Esb from the image
charge density −βσs at a distance −d below the surface.
From Gauss's law Esa = σs/2ǫ0, Esb ≈ −βσs/ǫ0I(2d)
where I(x) =< Ecz > is the z Coulomb electric field
from the image charge density on the tip averaged over
the tip. From these equations, we get

R = r1/ sin θ, Φ = φ.

σs = 2ǫ0Es2/[1 − 2βI(2d)].

(4)

The Jacobian of the transformation is J = R2 sin θ−2. We
construct the basis function for this surface from the basis

We have calculated I(x) numerically and tabulated it for
a mesh of 4000 points in the region 0 < x/d0 < 2.

Recent experiments have been carried out at IR fre-
quency with λ = 10µm, h = 20µm, a = 5µm, b = 10nm,
d0 = 60nm, t = 20nm, dm = 0.6nm and at THz fre-
quency with λ centered at 300µm, h = 70µm, a = 20µm,
b = 50nm,, d0 = 150nm, dm = 0.6nm. In the latter case,
the tip is solid; the effective thickness of the film is thus
the skin depth ξ. For this case t/a ≈ 0.01 whereas for
the IR case, t/a = 4 × 10−3. We have carried out calcu-
lations for these parameters. The incoming field is at an
angle of 60 degrees with respect to the surface normal.
This field is nearly uniform across the tip. The coupling
is thus dominated by the m=0 mode which we focus on.
We have calculated the circuit parameters Z for the
m=0 modes with the basis functions cXm=0(kir) for up
to 16 wave vectors ki. As usual, the magnitude of Z
increases as ki is increased. This makes the problem
rapidly convergent in our approach. The expansion co-
efficients for the current density in the basis cN0(kir)
are shown in Fig. (2) (right panel) where the nature of
convergence of our expansion is illustrated. The current
density j = jcju is in units of ju = Eext/ρu where the re-
sistivity unit is ρu = Z0ωat/c, Z0 is the resistance of the
vaccum. The IR experiments were carried out at a higher
normalized wave vector and thus have more intermediate
components. The magnitude of the current densities as a
function of the normalized position on the cone for both
the IR and the THz experiments are shown in Fig. 2 (left
panel). The charge density contains a bulk contribution

bulk current density jc (right panel) in terms of the normal
modes wave vectors index i and (left panel) as a function of
its normalized distance from the tip for parameters for two
sets of experiments in the IR and THz regime. (right panel)

from currents inside the cone given by n = −i∇ · j/ω.
Because the current density is nearly zero around the
tip at z/h ≈ 0, its spatial derivative and hence this bulk
charge density is only nonzero away from the tip at a dis-
tance much larger than d since d/h << 1. Thus this bulk
charge will not contribute to near field results. The total
"bulk" charges in units of Qu = ǫ0Eexta2 for the THz
case [ (-0.07+0.04i) ] and the IR case [ (-0.16+0.007i) ]
are comparable in magnitude.

There are additional contributions to the charge from
the surface charge densities localized at the tip (σs2) and

3

the base (σs1). σsi = Esiσu where σu = 2ǫ0Eext, For
the IR vase, Es1/Eext = 0.163 − 0.0168i, Es2/Eext =
4.374+6.23i. For the THz case Es1/Eext = 0.142+0.188i,
Es2/Eext = −28.52 − 14.70i. The magnitude of the sur-
face charge at the tip in the THZ case is five times bigger
than that for the IR experiments. This comes about be-
cause the wavelength of the external field is much closer
to the size of the cone for the THZ experiments, Ei,ext is
dominated by the component with i=1, as is illustrated
in Fig. 2.

We next look at the scattered field Sn at the modulated
frequencies ω + nΩ from the moving bulk and surface
charges. The scattered fields at a distance r from the
tip are proportional to the vector potential given by[29]
A(r) = iωµ0eikr R dr′j(r′)/r. The total current density
of the vibrating tip is a sum of a current induced by
the incoming field and a current jd = n∂td from the
induced charge n and the vibration of the tip ∂td. n
contains both bulk and boundary charge contributions.
The "bulk" charges contribute mainly to the fundamental
with n=1. The contributions to the higher harmonics
with n > 1 is dominated by near field contributions when
the tip is close to the surface and comes mainly from the
localized charge at the tip. The radiation electric field
Sn is proportional to the Fourier transform at frequency
ω + nΩ of the contributions jdl to jd from the localized
charges at the tip. From Eq. (4) we get

E ∝ eiωt(1 + β) cos(Ωt)/[1 − 2βI(d)].

(5)

As a test, we have calculated the amplitude S2 and its
phase as a function of frequency using as input dielectric
constants corresponding to a uniform surface of SiO2.
The experimental result together with ours are shown
in the left panel Fig.
(3). The overall magnitude of
the amplitudes and the baseline for the phase depend
on the experimental geometry and thus are the two ad-
justable parameters. The agreement is very good. For
comparison, results obtained with commonly used simple
tip modelling as well as CST simulation with a similar tip
geometry are shown in the right panel. The agreement
with the experimental phase is not as accurate.

The fundamental is comparable and much larger than
the higher harmonics respectively in recent experiments
carried out at the THz and the IR frequencies. The local-
ized tip charge dominates the contribution to the higher
harmonics and becomes much bigger for the THz experi-
ments, providing an intuitive understanding of the origin
of the near-field signals.

We close with an example of the inverse problem of
extracting the physical properties from the measured[30]
higher harmonics response for a gold disk of diameter
approximately 1.3 µm and thickness ≈ 50nm. We calcu-
lated a table of S3 and φ3 as functions of −0.1 < Re[β] <
1.4, −0.5 < Im[β] < 0.5 from eq. (5) for a mesh of 6400
grid points .This takes 2.7 sec with a conventional Intel
processor. For a pixel at position r, we go through the
entries in our table and identify β(r) as the one such that
S3(β(r)) − Sexpt
(r) is minimized.

plitude and phase of the third harmonics (top panels)
are well reproduced. This substantiates the calculation
reported in this paper. The extracted β are shown in
the bottom panels. We found that Re[β] ≈ 1.2 (0),
Im[β] ≈ 0.07 (0) inside (outside) the disk. This tech-
nique may also be a new tool for mapping of the changes
induced by external fields. The detailed analysis of this
will be discussed in a separate paper.

of the third harmonics as a function of position on the disk.
Bottom Panels: The extracted values of β.

Two dimensional plots of β, S3 and φ3 are shown in
Fig. 4. Even though the material exhibits the same in-
trinsic ǫ independent of position, there is a variation in
the extracted β from the average value. We believe that
is due to charge densities on the disk induced by the EM
field . More precisely, β is determined from the condition
that the change of the perpendicular component of the
displacement field D⊥ at the disk-air interface is equal
to the surface charge denisty σdisk: ∆D⊥ = σdisk. Our
study of the EM scattering on disks[26] suggests that
there is an edge electric field and its associated charge at
the perimeter of the disk. The variation of the physical
quantities is indeed dominated by changes at the perime-
ter, in agreement with our expectation.

To get a more quantitative picture of our results, we
plot the physical quantities as a function of the position
across a diameter of the disk along the direction of the

These are as a function of position across a diameter of the
disk.

In conclusion, we study the elastic scattering of an EM
wave by a conical metallic surface via representing the
fields on the surface in basis functions containing the in-
tegrable singularities at the tip. We apply our calculation
to s-SNOM and found good agreement with experimen-
tal results from a vibrating metallic tip over a uniform
sample. We found the field-induced charge distribution
consists of a bulk term along the body of the cone and
localized terms at the tip apex and the base. The bulk
charge is far away from the tip and contributes little to
the near-eld higher harmonics in the scattered field. The
localized boundary charges at the tip apex contribute to
the near-field signal and correspond to the charge accu-
mulation effects previously discussed in pn junctions and
on the surface of capacitor plates in AC experiments[31 -- 
33].
In these treatments, the additional physics of the
diffusion of the electrons are included and a finite width
in the localized charge distribution of the order of the
screening length is found. This localized boundary charge
provides new insight into the physics of the scattering
problem, which can be related to the distinct S1/S2 ra-
tio found in recent experiments at IR and THz frequen-
cies.
In addition, we also demonstrate the application
of our technique by extracting a two-dimensional effec-
tive dielectric constant map of a finite plasmonic metallic
disk from experimental data, which is non-uniform due
to the induced charge density distribution under the illu-
mination of EM field. Our calculations of the scattering

signal and the back-extraction process are more realistic
and much faster compared to the prevailing analytical
and numerical approaches. Future studies will include

the calculation of near-field scattering signal of nonuni-
form samples.
