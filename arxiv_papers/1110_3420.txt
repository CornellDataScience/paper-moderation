We investigate interaction effects in three dimensional weak topological insulators (TI) with an
even number of Dirac cones on the surface. We find that the surface states can be gapped by a surface
charge density wave (CDW) order without breaking the time-reversal symmetry. In this sense, time-
reversal symmetry alone can not robustly protect the weak TI state in the presence of interactions.
If the translational symmetry is additionally imposed in the bulk, a topologically non-trivial weak
TI state can be obtained with helical edge states on the CDW domain walls. In other words, a CDW
domain wall on the surface is topologically equivalent to the edge of a two-dimensional quantum
spin Hall insulator. Therefore, the surface state of a weak topological insulator with translation
symmetry breaking on the surface has a "half quantum spin Hall effect", in the same way that the
surface state of a strong topological insulator with time-reversal symmetry breaking on the surface
has a "half quantum Hall effect". The on-site and nearest neighbor interactions are investigated in
the mean field level and the phase diagram for the surface states of weak topological insulators is
obtained.

INTRODUCTION

Topological insulators (TIs) have recently attacted a
lot of interest in the condensed matter physics com-
munity due to its fundamental novelty and potential
application1 -- 4. Unlike normal insulators, TIs possess
gapless modes with linear Dirac dispersion at the edge
or surface as a direct physical consequence of the bulk
topology and the time reversal symmetry. TIs have been
realized in both two dimension, such as HgTe quan-
tum wells5,6, and three dimension, including Bi1−xSbx
7,
Bi2Se3 family8 -- 10 and TlBiSe2 family11 -- 15. Within the
non-interacting band theory, it is proposed that the TIs
can be further classified into two classes16 -- 18, one is the
strong TI, which possesses odd number of Dirac cones at
the surface and has been realized in experiment as men-
tioned above, while the other one is the so-called weak
TI, which has even number of Dirac cones. The weak TI
is topologically equivalent to a stack of two dimensional
TI (quantum spin Hall insulator) and is unstable against
the translation breaking term16. It is also proposed that
one dimensional helical liquid can exist along the dislo-
cation line of the lattice in a weak TI, which is believed
to be protected by time reversal and stable against the
weak disorder19,20. Recently, it is predicted that weak
TI surface states are stable under time-reversal-invariant
disorder21,22.

In the presence of interactions, the strong TI can be
defined in terms of the topological field theory23 with
a quantized axion angle of θ = π. Since the bulk ax-
ion topological term can be expressed in terms of the
Chern-Simons term on the surface, the axion angle of
θ = π implies a "half quantum Hall effect" on the surface,
when time reversal symmetry is broken on the surface but
preserved in the bulk. The half quantum Hall effect is

responsible for the topological magneto-electric effect of
the strong TI23. The time reversal symmetry breaking
on the surface can be realized by Ising type magnetic
moments oriented along the surface normal. A single
chiral mode exists on the domain wall of the magnetic
moments. Strong TI can be generally defined this way
as long as the time reversal symmetry is present inside
the bulk, without specific reference to the translational
symmetry of the lattice and the periodic band structure.
However, weak TI is not generally robust when only time
reversal symmetry is present in the bulk, in fact we shall
show that it is possible to open up a gap on the surface
without breaking the time reversal symmetry. Therefore,
lattice translation symmetry must also be imposed in the
bulk for the weak TI to be topologically well defined. In
this case, it is natural to ask what is the physical effect
associated with breaking the translational symmetry on
the surface of a weak TI. In this paper, we investigate
interaction effects in weak TI by first writing a minimal
four band model for weak TIs. Then we show that the
weak TI phase, possessing two Dirac cones at the (0, π)
and (π, 0) of the surface Brillioun zone respectively, can
be obtained by properly tuning the parameters of the
four band model. The surface staggered potential ((π, π)
charge density wave) can induce the scattering between
the two Dirac cones and gap the surface states without
breaking time reversal symmetry. Interestingly, a helical
liquid, identical to the edge states of the 2D topological
quantum spin Hall insulator5,6, emerges at the domain
wall for the staggered potential. Consequently, the gaped
surface state of weak TI can be regarded as a half quan-
tum spin Hall state, in analogy to the half quantum Hall
state for the gaped surface state of strong topological in-
sulators. We propose such a "half quantum spin Hall
effect" as a robust defining feature of weak TI. Since the

quantum spin Hall state is stable upon electron interac-
tion, so is the half quantum spin Hall effect. As long as
the translation symmetry in the bulk is preserved, the
weak TI is a well-defined topological state defined by the
helical liquid on the domain wall of a surface CDW or-
der. To find the condition for the surface CDW order, we
further investigate the effect of repulsive interaction for
the surface states of weak TIs. Our results show that the
surface CDW state with half quantum spin hall effect is
realized when nearest neighbor repulsion dominates the
on-site repulsion, while a ferromagnetic quantum anoma-
lous Hall state is induced in the opposite limit. We find
the surprising result that the antiferromagnetic order is
not favored by the on-site repulsion on the surface of a
weak TI, in sharp contrast to conventional 2D systems.

II. HALF QUANTUM SPIN HALL STATE

The four band model introduced by Zhang et al has
been successfully used to describe the strong topological
insulator of Bi2Se3 family of materials8. For simplicity,
we use the tight-binding regularization to re-write the
four band model in the cubic lattice

ψ†(k)H(k) ψ(k)

H = Xk
H(k) = M(k)Γ5 + A Xi=1,2,3

Γi sin ki

(1)

where M(k) = M0 + 6B − 2BPi cos ki, Γ1 = σ1 ⊗ τ1,
Γ2 = σ2 ⊗ τ1, Γ3 = σ3 ⊗ τ1, Γ4 = 1 ⊗ τ2 and Γ5 =
1 ⊗ τ3. Here M0, B and A are model dependent param-
eters, and for simplicity, we take B > 0. We consider
two orbitals, as well as spin, so that the field operator
ψ(k) = [ca,↑, cb,↑, ca,↓, cb,↓]T (a and b are orbital indices).
Pauli matrices σ denote spin and τ denote orbital. The
model is assumed to be isotropic and preserve inversion
symmetry P = 1 ⊗ τ3. Due to the inversion symme-
try, the Z2 topological nature of the system can be eas-
ily extracted from the parities of the occupied states at
the time reversal invariant points according to Fu-Kane
criterion16. There are totally eight time reversal invariant
points in the whole 3D Brillioun zone (BZ), denoted as
Λi = (κ1, κ2, κ3) (i = 1 . . . 8) where κ1,2,3 = 0 or π. The
parities of the occupied bands can be easily obtained from
the sign of the mass term M(k) for the above Hamilto-
nian (1), denoted as δΛi = −sgn (M(k = Λi)). Then the
strong TI Z2 index is defined as16
(−1)ν0 = ΠiδΛi

(2)

and three weak TI Z2 indices are given by

(−1)νk = Πκk=πδ(κ1,κ2,κ3).

(3)

The strong TI index is determined by the product of the
parities of all the eight Λi point in BZ while the weak TI
index νk is given by the product of the parities of the four

2

Λi in the κk = π plane (k = 1, 2, 3). With the above defi-
nition, the topological property of the Hamiltonian (1) is
determined by (ν0; ν1ν2ν3), and we find the following dif-
ferent parameter regimes for the system. When M0 > 0
or M0 < −12B, the system is a trivial insulator with the
Z2 index (ν0; ν1ν2ν3) = (0; 000); when 0 > M0 > −4B
or −8B > M0 > −12B, the system shows the strong
TI phase with the Z2 index (1; 000) or (1; 111); when
−4B > M0 > −8B, the system stays in the weak TI
phase with Z2 index (0; 111). Since here we are only in-
terested in the weak TI phase, we focus on the parameter
regime −4B > M0 > −8B.
To investigate the surface state of weak TI, we consider
the Hamiltonian (1) in a semi-infinite configuration (only
z < 0 region) with open boundary condition at z = 0, so
that the surface is normal to (100) direction (z direction).
It should be noted that the detailed form of surface state
for weak TI will depend on the direction of the surface.
The surface states can be calculated numerically with
the iterative Green function method24 and the obtained
surface local density of state is shown in Fig 1. In the
regime −4B > M0 > −8B, it is found that there are
two Dirac cones, located at ~Q1 = (π, 0) and ~Q2 = (0, π)
of the surface BZ. At the momentum ~Qj (j=1,2), the
eigen states of the Hamiltonian (1) can also be solved
analytically with the eigen wave function given by

Ψσ

where ~ρn = (nx, ny), σ denotes spin index and N is the
normalization factor. The spin part of the wave function
is given by

0 (cid:19)
ϕ↑0 = (cid:18) ξy

ϕ↓0 = (cid:18) 0

(λ − λ−1) + M0 + 6B − B(λ + λ−1) = 0.

(6)

It is found that only in the regime −4B > M0 > −8B,
λ1,2 will satisfy λ1,2 > 1, hence a normalizable wave
function (z → −∞ limit) exists, which agrees with the
parity criterion discussed above. With the eigen wave
function of the surface states, we project the Hamiltonian
(1) into the sub-space spanned by Ψσ
Qj , which can be
done by expanding the operator ψ(~n) as

ψ(~n) ≈ Xj,σ

Ψσ

Qj (~ρn, nz)cj,σ(~ρn)

(7)

where the new operator cj,σ(~ρn) is assumed to slowly vary
with ~ρn. Substituting (7) into (1), we find the effective
Hamiltonian for the surface state

). Here σ and τ denote
Pauli matrices in spin and the two Dirac cones at ~Q1,2 of
the surface BZ. This Hamiltonian satisfies time reversal
symmetry T = ΘK with Θ = iσy ⊗ 1 and K complex
conjugation.
The next question is which kind of scattering can open
a gap for the surface states without breaking time re-
versal. With a single Dirac cone, it is found that the
two components are related to each other by time rever-
sal symmetry, therefore it is not possible to open a gap
without breaking time reversal by the scattering within
a single Dirac cone. Consequently, we need to consider
the scattering between two Dirac cones, as shown in Fig
2 (b). The only mass term which can gap both Dirac
cones while preserving time reversal symmetry is

H1 = DZ d2rΨ†1 ⊗ τ1Ψ.

(9)

To identify the physical meaning of H1, we can re-
write this term in the lattice model and obtain the form

H1 = DPn(−1)nx−ny c†(~n)c(~n), which is nothing but

the staggered potential (or (π, π) charge density wave)
at the surface. The staggered potential breaks transla-
tion symmetry, enlarges the lattice unit-cell and reduces
the surface BZ. In the new surface BZ, as shown by the
dashed line in Fig 2 (b), two Dirac cones can be related
to each other by the reciprocal lattice vector, therefore
they actually correspond to the same point and can be
gapped in the reduced BZ. Thus the weak TI requires the
protection of translation symmetry and can be adiabati-
cally connected to the normal insulator if the translation
symmetry is broken.

However there is still a non-trivial physical conse-
quence for the gapped system. For the surface staggered
potential, there are two possiblilities, as shown by the left
side and right side of Fig 2 (a), which are related to each
other by a shift of one lattice constant and correspond
to the mass term D > 0 and D < 0 in the Hamilto-
nian (9), respectively. Now the surface states are de-
scribed by Dirac equations, and when a mass domain
wall forms between two possible staggered potentials,

3

zero modes are expected to emerge at the domain wall,
as shown in Fig 2 (a). To see this, we consider a mass
domain wall along x direction, namely D(x) = D0 > 0
when x > 0 and D(x) = −D0 < 0 when x < 0. At
ky = 0 point, the eigen equation for the zero modes (with
zero eigen-energy) reads ∂xψ(x) = D(x)(σ2 ⊗ τ2)ψ(x),
which leads to the normalizable domain wall solution
Aψs(x) = 1√N
e−D0x/Aξs− (s = ±), where N is normal-
ization factor and ξst is the eigen-state of (σ2 ⊗ τ2) with
(σ2⊗τ2)ξst = tξst. s = ± denotes the additional degener-
acy for the solution ψs(x) and because [σ1⊗ τ3, σ2⊗ τ2] =
0, we can take ξst also as the eigen-state of σ1 ⊗ τ3 with
(σ1⊗ τ3)ξst = sξst. Because T (σ1⊗ τ3)T −1 = −(σ1⊗ τ3),
(σ1 ⊗ τ3)T ξst = −T (σ1 ⊗ τ3)ξst = −sT ξst, which indi-
cates that ξ+− and ξ−− are two Kramers' partners. We
can project the Hamiltonian (8) with nonzero ky into
the subspace spanned by ψ±(x) and obtain the effective
−ky c−(cid:17) where
Hamiltonian H1D = APky (cid:16)c†+ky c+ − c†
c± and c†
± denote the annihilation and creation operator
for the zero modes ψ±(x). From the form of the effective
Hamiltonian, the zero mode solution at the mass domain
wall is exactly the helical liquid, consisting of only one
left mover and one right mover, which are related to each
other by time reversal, identical to the edge states dis-
covered in the 2D quantum spin Hall state5,6. A direct
numerical calculation of the surface states with the mass
domain wall exactly gives the above physical picture, as
shown in Fig 2 (c). Here we can furthermore make the
analogy to the surface state of the strong TI. When the
top and bottom surfaces of a strong TI slab are covered
by magnetic materials with the magnetization direction
as shown in Fig. 14 of Ref.23 and reproduced here in
Fig 3 (a), the system has one chiral edge mode and ex-
hibit the Hall conductance of e2
h . Since two surfaces con-
tribute equally to the e2
h Hall conductance, each surface
is expected to contribute half of the Hall conductance
e2
2h , leading to the so-call half quantum Hall effect16,23.
Here similarly, consider the weak TI slab sandwiched by
two (π, π) charge density wave materials, then the system
will become a quantum spin Hall insulator with a helical
mode along the edge, as shown in Fig 3 (b). Again the
top and bottom surfaces contribute equally to the quan-
tum spin Hall insulator, consequently we can regard one
surface state as a half quantum spin Hall state.

INTERACTION EFFECT

In this section we hope to investigate the effect of the
interaction on the surface states of weak TI within the
mean field approximation. Here the on-site and nearest
neighbour interaction are taken into account, with the

The phase diagram of the system can be obtained by

The last term gives the chemical potential which deter-
mines the density n, and when the chemical potential is
at the Dirac point of the surface states, the density n is
taken to be zero.

Next let's analyze the possible non-trivial phase in-
duced by the interaction Hamiltonian HU and HV . First
we only consider the nearest neighbour interaction HV .
From Eq. (15), we can see that V2 term prefers (π, π)

with the high energy cut-off Λ. For the above equation,
a self-consistent solution only exists when V2 > V2c =
. When this condition is satisfied, there is
2(Λ−√2πn)
(π, π) charge density wave in the system, which induces
the half quantum spin Hall state.

For HU , the situation is a little more complicated
since there are three different order parameters:
ferro-
magnetism m3, anti-ferromagnetism S3 and charge den-
sity wave D. Charge density wave D has been discussed
above and here we focus on the competition between the
ferromagnetic order m3 and anti-ferromagnetic order S3.
Interestingly, we find that the ferromagnetic order m3
will induce a gap of the system but the anti-ferromagnetic
order S3 can not. Consequently we expect that the ferro-
magnetic order will win, which is different from the usual
two dimensional electron gas where the on-site Hubbard
interaction will induce the anti-ferromagnetic order. In-
deed, the minimum of the total free energy is determined
by the self-consistent equations

U =

2Λ2 (cid:18)qA2Λ2 + (2 U m3)2 + 2 U m3(cid:19) , S3 = 0. (18)
Non-zero ferromagnetic order requires U > Uc = πA
2Λ .
In such case, the time reversal symmetry is sponte-
nously broken and the ferromagnetic order open a gap
for each Dirac cone separately. Since each Dirac cone
will contribute half quantized Hall conductance when it
is gapped, the surface state has Hall conductance e2
h .

Now let's discuss the coexistence of the on-site and
nearest neighbour interaction, where the ferromagnetic
order m3 will compete with the charge density wave order
D.
In such case, we only consider the competition of
these two orders and obtain

merically and the phase diagram is shown in Fig. 4. The
system remains in the semi-metal phase for the small
U and V. When U is increased, there is a continous
phase transition to the ferromagnetic order with quan-
tum anomalous Hall effct, while when V is increased,
there is a phase transition to the charge density wave
order with half quantum spin Hall effect. When U and
V coexist, there is a first order phase transition. This
picture is quite similar to the interaction effect in the

that the charge density wave can induce half quantum
spin Hall effect.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

As a summary, we investigate interaction effects for
the surface states of the weak TI and the related phase
diagram. We show that the weak TI can be topolog-
ically robust if we supplement time reversal symmetry
with translational symmetry in the bulk. Helical modes
exist on the domain wall of CDW order on the surface
and the associated "half quantum spin Hall effect" of
the surface can be used as a general defining physical
property of the weak TI. This provides one example of
that the symmetry breaking inducing non-trivial physi-
cal phenomena. Recently, several papers21,22 discuss the
disorder effect of the weak TI and show that the weak
TI is robust against the time reversal invariant disorder.
This is consistent with our results here because in their
case, the translation symmetry is not broken macroscop-
ically after taking the average of the disorder, while in
our case, the charge density wave breaks the translation
symmetry macroscopically which induces a band gap for
the surface state. Moreover, we conjecture that the weak
anti-localization for the surface state of weak TI under
the time reversal invariant disorder can also be under-
stood as a consequence of the half quantum spin Hall
effect we studied. Consider the clean surface with CDW
order, and turn on non-magnetic impurities. The dis-
order will pin different CDW domains around different
spatial points, leading to random CDW domain walls on

the surface. There is a pair of helical edge states propa-
gating along each domain wall. With random impurities,
the area of the two types of CDW domains are always
equal on average, so that the edge channels are always
conducting due to percolation.

Finally, we remark on the possible material realiza-
tion of the weak TI. The only known material exhibiting
non-trivial weak TI index is Bi1−xSbx alloy16,26, which
also has non-trivial strong TI index. Consequently, if a
charge density wave order is introduced on the surface of
Bi1−xSbx, the surface will become a half quantum spin
Hall state coexisting with an additional massless Dirac
cone from the strong TI index. The weak TI phase is
also proposed recently for the 1/6 and 2/3 filling frac-
tions in the octahedron-decorated cubic lattice27. Search
for new weak TI materials will be another interesting
question for the future research. We also notice a recent

paper with a related but different proposal that charge
density wave can also induce quantum spin Hall effect in
some 2D systems28.
