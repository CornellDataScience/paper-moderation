Electron pumps capable of delivering a current higher than 100 pA with sufficient accuracy are
likely to become the direct mise en pratique of the possible new quantum definition of the am-
pere. Furthermore, they are essential for closing the quantum metrological triangle experiment
which tests for possible corrections to the quantum relations linking e and h, the electron charge
and the Planck constant, to voltage, resistance and current. We present here single-island hy-
brid metal/semiconductor transistor pumps which combine the simplicity and efficiency of Coulomb
blockade in metals with the unsurpassed performances of silicon switches. Robust and simple pump-
ing at 650 MHz and 0.5 K is demonstrated. The pumped current obtained over a voltage bias range
of 1.4 mV corresponds to a relative deviation of 5×10−4 from the calculated value, well within the
1.5×10−3 uncertainty of the measurement setup. Multi-charge pumping can be performed. The sim-
ple design fully integrated in an industrial CMOS process makes it an ideal candidate for national
measurement institutes to realize and share a future quantum ampere.

INTRODUCTION

Linking measurement units to quantum effects rather
than artefacts
is a major achievement of modern
science[1]. The electrical base unit of the S.I., the am-
pere, which is defined by the force acting between two
ideal conductors, is not directly realized anymore.
In-
stead, electrical metrology has been based since 1990 on
voltage and resistance realized with the Josephson and
quantum Hall effects [2]. For the S.I. to fully benefit from
their remarkable accuracy, a full set of quantum electri-
cal units based on e and the Planck constant h could be
adopted, where the ampere would be a number of ele-
mentary charges e per unit time. Just like the speed of
light was fixed when the meter was redefined, the fun-
damental constants e and h would then be fixed and the
mise en pratique of the new definition of the ampere
would be made by using the combination of the Joseph-
son and quantum Hall effects. A SET current standard
based on an electron pump driven at a frequency f , pro-
ducing a quantized current I = N ef (where N is an
integer) with an amplitude of 100 pA or more could also
be used for the realization of the new ampere. Further-
more, such a current is necessary for the quantum metro-
logical triangle experiment which consists in achieving
Ohm's law between the three effects used in quantum
electrical metrology: Josephson effect (voltage), quan-
tum Hall effect (resistance) and single electron tunneling
effect (current). It aims to test the possible corrections
to the relations linking e and h to the constants associ-
ated with three quantum effects: Josephson constant KJ,
von Klitzing constant RK and an estimate of the electron
charge [3, 4].

The understanding of the Coulomb blockade phe-
nomenon [5] rapidly led to the design of electron pumps
and turnstiles both with fixed [6, 7] and tunable barri-
ers [8]. While turnstiles require a bias voltage to op-
erate, pumps deliver a d.c. current even at zero bias.
Metallic pumps with fixed height tunnel oxide barriers
and multiple Coulomb islands reached a relative accu-
racy in the 10−8 range, with up to 6 islands in series
between 7 tunnel junctions [9, 10]. Their complex oper-
ation was simplified by using only 3 junctions while low-
ering errors due to cotunneling with resistors [11]. De-
spite these efforts the level of current remained below
10 pA (f ≈60 MHz), too small by at least one order of
magnitude for a practical current source. They are also
restricted to very low temperatures (below 50 mK) and
cannot accept a bias voltage without a severe degrada-
tion of their accuracy [12]. With silicon technology, we
previously demonstrated electron pumping in a device
with two coupled islands and fixed barriers [13]. Hy-
brid normal/superconducting turnstiles [14] (which re-
quire a finite bias Vd) based on fixed barriers are also rel-
atively slow but can be operated in parallel to increase
the current [15]. An alternative option using optically
driven self-assembled quantum dots has also been demon-
strated recently [16]. A different pumping scheme revived
a strong interest in the field because it reached the de-
sired level of current [17 -- 20] and recently an accuracy
approaching the ppm level [21]. It uses non-adiabatic ef-
fects in the population of a dynamical quantum dot [22].
Operation in series of several such pumps have also been
realized, with an integrated charge sensing scheme [23].
At the same time as metallic pumps with fixed barriers
an experiment was performed which also uses orthodox
Coulomb blockade but on a single semiconducting island
connected by two tunable barriers [8]. Using π phase
shifts on the two barriers, quantized currents were ob-
tained, up to 20 MHz. Although this pioneering work

focuses on turnstile operation, electron pumping at zero
bias was also briefly shown and discussed at the end of
the report [8]. Later on, a similar experiment with a sili-
con device [24] reached f =1 MHz, and more recently the
same idea was used but with π-shift only, resulting again
in turnstile operation [25].

In this work we clarify this pumping mechanism with
a novel type of electron pumps using industrial silicon
technology. We show that the phase difference between
the sinewaves applied to the two tunable barriers de-
termine the number of electrons pumped per cycle and
the direction of the current. A convincing evidence that
this pumping mechanism is at play is the observation of
an odd/even behaviour depending on the position of the
working point with respect to the Coulomb peaks of the
device. Since the pump studied here shows that it is pos-
sible to combine orthodox Coulomb blockade and high
speed, it opens new opportunities for quantum metrol-
ogy. This article is organized as follows. In section II,
the samples technology and main characteristics are pre-
sented briefly, together with the results of d.c. electri-
cal transport which unveil their electrostatic properties.
Section III describes the pumping principle and the ex-
perimental results, and section IV focuses on experiments
designed to assess the stability and accuracy of the pump.

II. SAMPLE DESIGN AND D.C. TRANSPORT

A. Fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator technology

A difficulty with quantized current sources comes from
the necessity to have a system containing at some point
a well defined number of charges e. Whether this relies
on a high charging energy Ec = e2/C for metallic dots
(here C is the total capacitance of the island), or on the
one-particle energy level spacing in a confinement poten-
tial created by gates, it requires the fabrication of a very
small structure, at the limit of typical academic nanofab-
rication facilities. Silicon field-effect transistors (FETs)
where gate length, channel width and thickness are all be-
low 20 nm are now developed and mass-produced by the
microelectronics industry. We have fabricated our elec-
tron pumps with the advanced Fully-Depleted Silicon-
On-Insulator (FD-SOI) technology which just entered
production for consumer electronics. Compared to con-
ventional planar bulk technology, it offers a better elec-
trostatic control over a very small channel, since the thin
Si film forming the active area is isolated from the sub-
strate by a buried oxide (BOX) layer of SiO2, as shown
in Fig. 1b,c. This architecture is also very favorable
for Coulomb blockade operation [26]. The very reduced
volume of the transistor's channel yields a high charg-
ing energy, and it is well controlled by the gate elec-
trode. The lever-arm parameter α=Cg /C is close to
1 at 300 K (Cg is the gate capacitance). This trans-
lates into a slope S for the sub-threshold current (an
important figure of merit for transistors) approaching

the ideal value set by thermal activation of the carri-
ers: S ≈ ln(10)kBT /e=60 mV/decade at T =300 K (kB
is the Boltzmann constant). In addition to the top gate
acting as a tunable barrier (FET behaviour), biasing the
substrate with a back-gate voltage Vbg allows to change
both the threshold voltage and the tunnel coupling to
source and drain by more than an order of magnitude.
Thus the same transistor can be toggled between field-
effect and single-electron behaviour [27]. The key steps
of fabrication are nanowire lithography and etching, gate
stack deposition (SiO2 / N+ doped polysilicon) and pat-
terning, silicon nitride spacer deposition and etch (high-
lighted in green in Fig. 1a), source/drain epitaxy, doping
and silicidation (NiSi). Then the standard back-end pro-
cess includes embedding in SiO2, opening and filling vias,
metal lines (Cu) and finally Al pads. To obtain a pump,
two gates are designed in series with a small gap in be-
tween, as shown in Fig. 1. During the silicidation process
the gates and spacers act as a mask. As a result not only
the source and drain become truly metallic, but also the
island between the two gates. The critical dimensions of
the devices measured in this work are given in Table 1.

TABLE I. Dimensions of the samples presented in this article,
in nm. W and TSi stand for the nanowire's width and thick-
ness, Lg is the gate length, Sgg the spacing between the gates,
and "spacers" the spacers length. A single spacer was used for
s3, while the standard industrial two-step spacer process was
used for s1 and s2. Cg1 and Cg2 are the capacitive coupling
in aF between the central island and respectively gates 1 and
2.

B. d.c. electrostatics and transport

The metallic island is by design capacitively coupled to
the gates of both transistors, hence at low temperature
the drain-source current Ids versus gate voltages Vg1 and
Vg2 is a series of antidiagonal lines, as illustrated in Fig.
2a at 0.5 K. Each segment corresponds to the addition
of an extra electron on the central island and is limited
by the closure of the two FETs. In order to estimate the
efficiency of each barrier separately we set one of them to
+0.8 V to minimize its contribution to the total current
and sweep the other one. Such a measurement is shown
in Fig. 2b. As expected for industrial FETs, we found a
very steep current rise over more than 4 orders of mag-
nitude. At low temperature the sub-threshold slope S is
no more set by the ideal thermal activation discussed be-
fore but saturates, mainly because the conduction band is
broadened by disorder. Despite this, the recorded value
of 6.5 mV/decade at 0.5 K is excellent and critical for
electron pumping. Fig. 2c shows the periodicity of the
current recorded when both gates are varied in order to
follow the red diagonal line Vdiag drawn on top of Fig.
2a. The values Cg1 =19.1 aF and Cg2 =20.1 aF extracted
from this graph illustrate the symmetry of the coupling
to both FET gates.

III. ELECTRON PUMPING

The principle of the pumping experiment is depicted in
Fig. 3a,b. The white dashed line in Fig. 3a corresponds
to the region where dc current measurement falls below
the experimental noise floor because the barriers increase
rapidly. Applying phase-shifted sinewaves on the gates
corresponds to elliptic contours in the Vg1 − Vg2 plane.
They can be set to turn around a Coulomb peak with-
out ever crossing a black segment where current flows.
For this their center (set by the d.c. values of Vg1 and
Vg2 ) has to be chosen on or near the Coulomb segment
and the extension has to be large enough, as shown by
the ellipses in Fig. 3a. This contour has been used pre-
viously with silicon but with extremely opaque barriers
(always larger than 1011Ω), resulting in extremely slow

(1 MHz) and single-charge pumping[24]. With barriers
more than 6 orders of magnitude more transparent, we
can pump faster and extend the contour to turn around
several Coulomb lines, as illustrated by the blue ellipse
in Fig. 3a. Instead of a net current I = ef for the green
ellipse, one expects I = N ef where N is the number
of Coulomb lines enclosed by the contour (N =4 for the
blue ellipse). The sign of the current is simply changed
by turning in the other direction. Although never re-
ported so far, the periodicity of the Coulomb oscillations
should yield a different evolution of N depending on the
position of the contour center. With ellipses centered
near a line, only odd numbers of lines are enclosed, while
only even numbers occur for ellipses right in between two
lines. These two situations have been experimentally re-
alized. The corresponding pumped current plateaus are
shown respectively in Figs. 3c,d. They follow exactly the
expected odd/even behaviour.

The evolution of the slope of the plateaus as a function
of different parameters have been investigated at high fre-
quency. Results for sample s2 are shown in Fig. 4. The
evolution of the pumped current versus Vdiag is shown in
Fig. 4a at 0.5 K, for Vd =0. The rms amplitudes of the r.f.
signals at 650 MHz on the gates are 19 mV and 19.8 mV,
in order to account for the small difference in couplings
to the two gates, and therefore align the long axis of the
ellipse with the Coulomb segments pattern. The phase

Vd (1.2 mV), in red, we obtain the lower limit of 250 GΩ
for this resistance. The flatness of the plateaus versus r.f.
amplitude and relative phase are important to check that
the flat region is wide enough to be well within control.
The data shown in Fig. 4c,d gives a comfortable working
range of 70 mV and 6◦.

Operation up to 1 GHz and for several values of N is
shown in Fig. 4e at 0.6 K. At Vd =0 a plateau is still
obtained up to N = 7, corresponding to a quantized cur-
rent I ≈1.12 nA. For this measurement with large N , i.e.
a wide ellipse, the r.f. amplitude has to be increased
significantly to maintain a large penetration into the re-
gions shaded in grey in Fig. 3a, where the island popula-
tion will eventually change. A maximum rms amplitude
of 33.5 mV was used (for N =7 at f =1 GHz), which is
possible at 600 mK but could be challenging at signifi-
cantly lower temperatures, where heating can occur[25].
It is clear however that the flatness quickly degrades with
increasing N , as a result of the inadequate trajectory
looking too much like a circle. For better performance a
custom trajectory performed with an arbitrary waveform
generator could be used [21].

While N is determined near Vd =0 by the num-
ber of Coulomb lines enclosed by the ellipse, it can be
changed with a sufficient Vd bias. This corresponds to
the Coulomb staircase.
In principle this is the case in
any dot, however the barriers are often strongly affected
by the bias and only the first diamond can be observed.
In our system clear plateaus are still found up to 8 mV,
with a period of approximately 4 mV (Fig. 4e) which can
be directly interpreted as the charging energy (4 meV),
without any lever-arm parameter. This is in excellent
agreement with Coulomb diamond measurements (not
shown). This behaviour in Vd is characteristic of systems
relying on orthodox Coulomb blockade, whether based
on GaAs[8], Si[25] or a metal like here. It is strikingly
different from the pumping scheme where the barriers
are made more transparent than the quantum of conduc-
tance. In that case the middle island is fully connected
to source or drain (hence there is no Coulomb blockade)
and no Vd dependence is found, even up to 200 mV[28].
The possibility to observe clear plateaus with a bias volt-
age up to twice the charging energy is directly related to
the robustness of the barriers in the OFF state, a figure
of merit called drain-induced barrier lowering in micro-
electronics.

IV. STABILITY AND ACCURACY

EXPERIMENTS

The accuracy of the pumped current has been assessed
with alternating current techniques, in order to cancel the
offset of the measurement chain.

Firstly, preliminary current measurements using a
cryogenic current comparator (CCC) have been carried
out on a fourth sample, at a reduced frequency of 50 MHz
with the CCC in internal feedback mode. Although this

phase-shifted RF signals on the two gates. Increasing the shift
results in wider ellipses enclosing several Coulomb segments of
the island (1 and 4 in the examples drawn in green and blue).
The white dashed lines and shaded regions indicate the onset
of conduction, respectively through gates 1 and 2. (b) Ids ver-
sus Vg1 and Vg2 in sample s2 at 0.5K. The dashed lines indicate
the 4 sequences of electron pumping. For the white lines the
potential of the island is kept constant hence its population as
well. The two red ones cross the Coulomb line and therefore
require a population change N < − > N + 1. As sketched,
these happen when one of the two barriers is very high, forc-
ing electron transfer to occur through the other one. (c) Nor-
malized current Ids /ef versus drain bias Vd for ellipses at
f =54 MHz centered near a Coulomb line, of equal amplitude
on both gates (-26.5 dBm) but different phase shifts. Plateaus
at odd numbers of electrons are found at 1 K since a growing
but always odd number of lines is surrounded as the ellipses
get wider. (d) Even plateaus obtained for ellipses centered in
between two Coulomb lines and therefore enclosing an even
number of lines.

in order to pump preferentialy -1 electron. When the
ellipse encloses only one Coulomb segment, a quantized
plateau at Ids /ef =-1 is obtained. Moving along Vdiag ,
there are regions where two segments are partially en-
closed. In that case there is a tendency to pump more
than one electron, hence the recorded current periodically
increases. This period (approximately 4.1 mV) is equal
to the one extracted from the conductance measurements
from which the gate capacitances given in Table 1 were
obtained. A working point indicated by the cross in Fig.
4a is chosen to study the dependence of the pumped cur-
rent with bias Vd (Fig. 4b) and r.f. amplitude (Fig. 4c)
and phase (Fig. 4d). An important figure of merit for a
current source is its output resistance, corresponding to
the flatness of the plateau in Fig. 4b. From the uncer-
tainty in a linear fit of the data across a large span of

scheme does not allow an accurate measurement of the
absolute value of the current, it allows to investigate the
current steps flatness and the long-term stability of the
device, shown in the supplementary material [29]. The
Allan deviation calculated for a 14-hour long measure-
ment exhibits a τ−1/2 variation with the averaging time
τ . This is a signature of a white noise regime over the
whole range of measurement time, up to 14 hours (Fig-
ures 1 and 2 of the supplementary material). The statisti-
cal uncertainty can therefore be estimated by calculating
the experimental deviation of the mean over the whole
set of data. It results in a relative statistical uncertainty
of 3 parts in 106 on the current value.
Secondly, calibrated commercial equipments have been
used. Fig. 5a shows the time evolution of the ±ef cur-
rents obtained by switching the phase alternatively be-
tween 171◦ and 189◦, at 0.5 K, 650 MHz and Vd =0. After
changing the phase and waiting for 5 seconds, two points
were recorded for each phase, with a 1 s integration time.
In order to evaluate the robustness of the obtained

value with bias voltage, this alternating technique is used
but on the much shorter timescale of a few tens of min-
utes, for which averaging out two-by-two subsequent val-
ues for + and - ef is beneficial (see supplementary ma-
terial). Then this whole set of data points is averaged to
yield a unique value for a certain Vd . This final dataset
is shown in Fig. 5b. The standard deviation of a linear
fit (in green in Fig. 5b) across the 1.4 mV of Vd gives
a lower limit of 6.8×1013 Ω for the resistance. Averag-
ing these 7 values yields a final current Ids /ef =1.00036
across a 1.4 mV voltage bias span, at 650 MHz and 0.5 K,
with a standard deviation of 0.00017. This value is well
within the 0.15% uncertainty in the gain of our measure-
ment setup after calibration.

errors in the pumping mechanism. An important contri-
bution to these errors may indeed come from the ther-
mal broadening of the Coulomb lines. Another source
of errors will arise from the finite steepness of the FETs
sub-threshold slope. Clearly, when the working point is
at an extremum of the ellipse, what matters is the ratio
of the minimum resistance Rmin of one barrier and the
maximum resistance Rmax reached by the other one [24].
For Rmin bound to be larger than 105 Ω for Coulomb
blockade operation, a resistance of Rmax = 1012 Ω has
to be reached for the other one if one targets a rela-
tive uncertainty of 10−7. This kind of performance is
probably reachable at low temperature with the FDSOI
technology which shows unrivaled performance in terms
of leakage. A more quantitative study is necessary, using
the simulation tools we have developed for our Coulomb
blockade devices and single-charge impurities
[30]. A
realistic simulation of the electrostatic system and tun-
able FET barriers has been implemented recently and
will be compared with the experimental dataThe repro-
ducibility and robustness of the fabrication technology
ensures a consistent quality allowing very exhaustive ex-
perimental investigations, since these embedded samples
do not age significantly. We have measured the same
SET device based on SOI technology 6 years apart, and
it has shown no significant modification in the pattern of
Coulomb oscillations at low temperature. Another ad-
vantage of the nanowire transistors is that these pumps
operate as FETs at 300 K. The room temperature mea-
surements provide valuable information on the samples
(e.g. maximum conductance, symmetry of the barriers)
which allows to sort and select samples for low temper-
ature investigation among the thousands available. A
practical current standard based on this device can in ad-
dition benefit from straightforward integration with sil-
icon technology. This includes on-chip CMOS circuits
or drive electronics as well as r.f. design for 1-10 GHz
operation. The authors acknowledge financial support

order of 100 pA, high enough to be relevant for the quan-
tum metrological triangle experiment. It should be noted
that the experiments were carried out without any ra-
diation shielding around the sample inside the vacuum
chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Although our best
value falls well below the accuracy of the measurement
system, this could significantly improve further measure-
ments with a more refined setup. The temperature of
0.5 K at which we did these experiments illustrates the
small dimensions (high charging energy) of the nanowire
transistors. However, a study in temperature will be
needed now, in order to investigate the main cause of
