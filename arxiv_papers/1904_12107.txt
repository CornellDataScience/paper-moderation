Light emitters in wide band gap semiconductors are of great fundamental interest and have po-
tential as optically addressable qubits. Here we describe the discovery of a new color center in
high-quality hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with a sharp emission line at 435 nm. The emitters
are activated and deactivated by electron beam irradiation and have spectral and temporal charac-
teristics consistent with atomic color centers weakly coupled to lattice vibrations. The emitters are
conspicuously absent from commercially available h-BN and are only present in ultra-high-quality
h-BN grown using a high-pressure, high-temperature Ba-B-N flux/solvent, suggesting that these
emitters originate from impurities or related defects specific to this unique synthetic route. Our
results imply that the light emission is activated and deactivated by electron beam manipulation of
the charge state of an impurity-defect complex.

INTRODUCTION

Luminescent defects in wide band gap semiconductors
are of great importance for both fundamental physics and
future technological applications. Many of these defects
are single photon emitters (SPEs), a likely component
of next-generation information technologies, especially
quantum cryptography1,2 and information processing3 -- 5.
SPEs embedded in solid state systems are particularly
significant for widespread adoption of these emerging
technologies as they offer a promising route toward scal-
able deployment of new integrated quantum circuits.
The diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center has been the
leading candidate for solid-state SPE applications be-
cause it can easily be manipulated and readout at room
temperature using existing optical methods6,7. Due to
the technical difficulty of synthesizing and fabricating
diamond-based devices, greater attention has been placed
on finding new solid-state SPE systems8,9 with particu-
lar emphasis placed on 2D material systems, especially
sp2-bonded hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) )10 -- 14.

h-BN or "white graphite" has been of great inter-
est to the nanoscience community over the last several
decades, in part because it is isostructural to graphite and
forms many of the same types of nanostructures as sp2-
bonded carbon, but with different electronic and ther-
modynamic properties15 -- 19. h-BN is especially impor-
tant to the expanding study of 2D materials because it
is atomically flat, inert, and electrically insulating, mak-
ing it an ideal substrate for testing new physics in low-
dimensional materials20. Recently it has been shown that
the local structure of h-BN can be controlled via electron
irradiation21,22 and synthetic methods23, allowing for ad-
ditional material control.

In this communication we report the discovery of a new
color center in high- quality h-BN, activated and charac-
terized by an electron beam. We show that these emit-
ters are highly localized, are spectrally pure, and have an
emission signature indicative of weak lattice coupling at
room temperature. These properties make the new color
center a promising candidate for future applications in
quantum information science.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

Ultra-high-quality h-BN crystals used in this study
(generally accepted as the best substrates available for
sensitive device applications and scanning probe mea-
surements) are synthesized using a Ba-B-N solvent pre-
cursor at high temperature and high pressure at the Na-
tional Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) by Watan-
abe and Taniguchi24. We refer to this material through-
out the text as NIMS-BN. Millimeter size crystallites are
mechanically exfoliated using blue wafer dicing tape and
transferred onto p++ silicon substrates (0.001-100 Ω-cm)
with a few nm thick native oxide layer. Samples of com-
mercially available h-BN (Alfa Aesar 040608) are sim-
ilarly exfoliated and transferred, and then annealed at
850 ◦C in argon at one Torr for one hour before charac-
terization.

We use CL in a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
to activate and characterize light emission from the h-
BN. CL measurements are performed using a home-built
SEM CL system shown in FIG. 1 The system is built
around a Zeiss Gemini Supra 55 VP-SEM operated at
accelerating voltages between 2-10 keV with beam cur-
rents in the 100-1500 pA range. Light emission from the

Figure 1.
Experimental setup for measuring cathodoluminescence (CL) in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The
electron beam excites the sample and causes it to fluoresce. The resulting light is then used for hyperspectral imaging by a
spectrometer (slow acquisition, low signal to noise, high spectral resolution) and point detectors (fast acquisition, high signal
to noise, low spectral resolution). A Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT) apparatus is used to measure the second order coherence
function (g2 (τ )) of the light emission.

sample is collected by a parabolic mirror and directed
down an optical path for characterization. Synchronous
data from SEM (secondary electron and in-lens detec-
tors) and optical (photon counting point detectors and
spectrometer) channels are acquired using the Molecular
Foundry ScopeFoundry software25. All experiments are
conducted at room temperature.

As the electron beam is rastered across the sample, the
light emission from each point of the scan can be cou-
pled into an optical fiber (Thorlabs FG200UEA) using a
UV-enhanced parabolic aluminum reflector and recorded
using a spectrometer (Princeton Instruments SP2300i)
with CCD camera (Andor 970-UVB) to capture the spec-
tral distribution of the light at each pixel, resulting in a
three-dimensional data set we refer to as a spectral image
(SI). The spectra are not intensity corrected for the wave-
length dependent efficiency of the spectrometer grating
and CCD camera.

Alternatively, the light can be directed through a
series of dichroic mirrors and bandpass filters to an
array of photon counting photomultiplier tube point-
detectors (Hamamatsu H7360-01, Hamamatsu H7421-40,
and Hamamatsu H7421-50), resulting in intensity images
of well-defined wavelength bands. We refer to such data
throughout the text as bandpass (BP) images.

Time-correlation of the emitted light can be measured
by coupling to a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) setup.
The arrival times of photons at the detectors in both
arms of the apparatus are recorded with 50 ps resolution
and a coincidence histogram as a function of delay time
between the two detectors is made. The raw coincidence
histogram is then normalized by the number of coinci-
dences at long delay times. A background correction
is performed using the signal to background ratio esti-

mated independently for each measurement26, resulting
in a measurement of the second-order auto-correlation
function (g2 (τ )) of the emitted light (See Supplemental
for details).

All data analysis is performed using common open-
source packages in the Python programming language.
Multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) of hyperspec-
tral images is carried out using the HyperSpy Python
package27.

III. RESULTS

We first describe results from NIMS-BN. In order to
activate and characterize individual emitters, we initially
identify large (lateral size of 10-100 µm) flakes of h-BN
using the raster scan images from the SEM electron de-
tectors, shown in FIG. 2(a). Optical and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) observations of our samples indicate
that the flakes generally have thicknesses of tens to hun-
dreds of nanometers. Relevant spectral bands for BP
imaging are determined by inspection of the average CL
spectrum, shown in FIG. 2(b), obtained by integrating
spectra while continuously scanning a single flake. We
isolate the primary spectral regions of interest (indicated
by the vertical lines and shaded regions in FIG. 2(b)):
280-409 nm (UV), 430-470 nm (Blue), and 485-735 nm
(Vis) for BP imaging with appropriate dichroic and band-
pass optics.

There are several striking features in each channel of
the BP images. FIG. 2(c) shows the spatial distribu-
tion of the previously reported UV emitters in the h-BN
flake14. The emitters have a point-like character and are
densely and uniformly distributed across the entire h- BN

Panel (b) shows the mean Cathodoluminescence (CL) response from the sample, with the three main spectral bands of interest
indicated by vertical lines and shaded regions. Panels (c-e) show the light emission from the flake in each of these 3 spectral
bands (wavelength range listed above each image, intensity scale in counts/pixel). Panel (c) shows UV light emission from
a high density of point-like emitters as well as bright emission from a large line-like feature. The intensity in the Blue band
arises mostly from the new point-like emitters, shown in Panel (d). Panel (e) shows the spatial distribution of intensity from
the green to red region of the spectrum (Vis). Emission in this band arises mostly from extended defects in the crystal. The
images are generated by averaging 17 consecutive scans, each with a pixel dwell time of 28.6 µs/pixel.

crystal, with enhanced emission along line-like features
that are likely associated with extended line defects28 or
strain caused by a wrinkle or fold in the crystallite29.
FIG. 2(e) shows very weak extended features in the Vis
band (485-735 nm) as previously reported28. These fea-
tures are localized at grain-boundaries and dislocations
within the h-BN crystal. No localized, point-like sources
of light emission are observed within this band using CL
BP imaging.

The bright, point-like features in the Blue BP image
between 430-470 nm in FIG. 2(d) show the new color
centers in NIMS-BN, which are the focus of this study.
They appear slightly larger and less dense compared to
the UV emitters in the previous panel. Also present is the
line-like feature from the UV band, as well as a very weak
signal from extended features in the Vis band. The broad
spectral character of these extended features results in
residual intensity leaking into the Blue band.

We further characterize electron-stimulated light emis-
sion from NIMS-BN using hyperspectral CL imaging by
collecting a CL spectrum from each pixel in a raster scan.

To isolate the unique spectral signature of each type of
emitter we perform a non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF) decomposition30 of the spectra in the SI into four
components that visualize the main features present in
the dataset. FIG. 3(a-f) show the results of the decompo-
sition. Each image (also called the decomposition loading
or decomposition weight) shows the relative abundance
of each associated spectral component (also called the
decomposition factor) below. The vertical red lines in
FIG. 3(a), 3(c), and 3(e) show the pass band used for
BP imaging in FIG. 2(c), 2(d), and 2(e), respectively.

The first component (see Supplemental) is a spatially
uniform background that reflects dark counts, noise, and
non-localized light emission. The component shown in
FIG. 3(e) and 3(f) shows the light emission of extended
line defects, as well as a small number of highly local-
ized features with appreciable intensity that are consis-
tent with previous photoluminescence (PL) studies10,11
of SPE in h-BN. FIG. 3(a) shows a dense collection of
point-like emitters, similar to the UV BP image in Fig.
2(b). The spectral features in the component in FIG.

multi-Gaussian fitting of the spectral component. Fitting
reveals a series of peaks, decreasing in intensity and in-
creasing in width with increasing wavelength. The spec-
trum is dominated by a sharp, well-defined zero phonon
line (ZPL), centered at 436 nm (2.84 eV), with a FWHM
of 10 nm (65 meV), contributing a spectral weight of
∼ 26%, followed by several phonon replicas at 443, 461,
and 484 nm (2.80, 2.69, and 2.56 eV). There is also a
small, broad, background component centered at 482 nm
(2.57 eV). In contrast to the UV emission described above
(where the phonon replicas have higher intensity than
the ZPL), the relatively high intensity of the ZPL com-
pared to the phonon replicas suggest that this emitters
coupling to the lattice is significantly weaker, a desirable
quality for possible applications in future quantum in-
formation technologies. The density of emitters in FIG.
3(c) is higher than in the BP image in FIG. 2(d) and
is related to the higher electron dose required for hyper-
spectral imaging, which will be discussed later.

Spectral information from the hyperspectral imaging
can be used to perform time-correlation measurements of
light from the blue emitters. A bandpass filter is selected
that covers a large portion of the emission peak from FIG.
3(d) in order to measure the second-order autocorrelation
function using HBT intensity interferometry. FIG. 3(h)
shows the result of this measurement from an ensemble
of emitters (See Supplemental for experimental details).
The majority of previous studies of light emission in h-
BN have measured g(2)
P L (τ ) using PL. In stark contrast,
g(2)
CL (τ ), measured in this study, exhibits a bunching peak
as opposed to an anti-bunching dip. This behavior, which
has been explored previously31,32, is attributed to simul-
taneous excitation of multiple color centers by the elec-
tron beam. In PL studies of defects in wide band gap
semiconductors, such as SPEs in h-BN and NV centers in
diamond, the excitation energy is typically less than the
band-gap of the material, resulting in the production of a
single e-h pair per photon. In CL, the excitation energy is
much higher than the band-gap of the material, resulting
in the excitation of many e-h pairs. A semi-empirical re-
lation predicts that approximately Ne−h = E0
e-h pairs
3Eg
are excited per incident electron33, where E0 is the beam
energy and Eg is the band gap of h-BN. For Eg = 6 eV
and E0 = 3 keV, Ne−h = 111.

Previous work34 has shown that if the bunching peak
of the g(2)
CL (τ ) function can be attributed to simultaneous
excitation of an ensemble of emitters, that the lifetime of
the defect state can be extracted similar to an analogous
PL measurement of the lifetime from the anti-bunching
dip. An exponential fit to the time correlation data using
g(2) (τ ) = 1 + a exp (−τ /τlif etime), with a and τlif etime
as free parameters, gives a lifetime of τlif etime = 2.6 ns
and g(2) (0) = 1.27. This lifetime is close in value to
previous measurements of SPEs in h-BN10 -- 14,34. The
g(2) (0) value is quite low, but it has been shown that at
high current, the bunching effect becomes washed out,
resulting in a decreased apparent value of g(2) (0). While

emitters across three spectral regions in h-BN. Hyperspectral
CL data are decomposed using Non-Negative Matrix Factor-
ization (NMF) to display the main features of the data. Each
image component (top row, scale bar 1 um) shows the spa-
tial distribution of the associated spectral component below
(middle row). The red lines on the spectral components in
panels (b), (d), and (f) show the edges of the bandpass fil-
ters used in bandpass imaging from FIG. 2. The spatial (a)
and spectral (b) distributions of the first component show
point-like UV emitters from 300-400 nm. The peaks between
600-700 nm are artefacts due to the second-order reflections
of the UV light from the spectrometer grating. Panels (c) and
(d) show the spectral signature of the newly discovered blue
color centers between 400-500 nm. Panels (e) and (f) show
extended emission features between 500-700 nm, likely caused
by extended defects and/or strain. Panel (g) shows a rescaled
view of the blue emission component as well as the results
of multi-gaussian fitting of the peak. The fitted components
show a Zero-Phonon Line (ZPL) followed by several phonon
replicas with decreasing amplitude, an indicator of a single-
photon emitter weakly coupled to the lattice. The photon-
correlation curve in (h) shows a bunching peak, a signature
of quantum emission in CL. Fitting to a single exponential
decay model gives a lifetime of several nanoseconds, similar
to lifetimes observed from SPE in other defects in h-BN.

3(b)) are a close match to UV SPEs in h-BN seen in
previous CL studies14.

The most striking feature, shown in FIG. 3(c) and
3(d), closely resembles the spectral and spatial sig-
natures of a typical color center in a wide bandgap
semiconductor10,12. Specifically, they are highly local-
ized, spectrally sharp, and the first peak is followed by
additional spectral features shifted by tens of meV that
are interpreted as evidence of electron-phonon coupling.
This component is investigated further in FIG. 3(g) using

Figure 4. Overview of switching behavior in hBN emitters. A series of CL bandpass images (409- 482 nm) are taken over
1.5 hours at 4.5 minutes per image, with each time point corresponding to a single image scan with an electron beam dose of
2.3 × 107 e−/A2. The top row shows the first, middle, and final images in the series at full spatial resolution (scale bar is 500
nm, color scale in units of counts/pixel). The bottom row shows the dynamic behavior of 4 separate 300 nm regions (indicated
by the colored boxes in the top panel) over the entire time series. The emitters exhibit clear switching behavior, turning on
and off between frames of the time series. Examples of emitters that suddenly turn on or off as the beam is passing over are
shown in panels (h) and (i), respectively. Panel (j) shows that the number of emitters in each frame grows roughly linearly
with electron beam dose.

the observed bunching peak and extracted fit parameters
are not incontrovertible proof that the new color center is
a quantum emitter, the presence of this peak is consistent
with the newly discovered blue emitter being a potential
single photon source.

There are two striking differences between the Blue
emitters shown in FIG. 2(d) and those shown in FIG.
3(c) that are associated with the higher electron dose re-
quired to acquire an SI compared to a BP image. First,
the number and density of features is higher in the SI,
indicating that we are creating new emitters by electron
irradiation. Second, a variation in the shape of individual
emitters appears. The emitters are round and symmet-
ric in the BP image in FIG. 2(d), while many emitters
appear to have a truncated shape in the SI component
in FIG. 3(c). This truncation, discussed below, is associ-
ated with a sudden activation or deactivation event while
the beam is over an emitter.

To further investigate this, we acquire a 2.5-hour time
series of long scan time (262 seconds per image) BP im-
ages over a flake of h-BN. Each image corresponds to an
exposed dose of 2.3 × 107 e−/A2 per image, with a to-
tal exposed dose of 5.7 × 108 e−/A2. Time-series data
are aligned and registered using template matching and
cross-correlation to correct for sample drift during the ex-
periment. Individual emitters were automatically identi-
fied in each frame of the time series using the difference
of Gaussian blob finding algorithm. 50x50 pixel regions
around emitters were extracted and image feature vectors
were calculated using the PCA weights of each image. Fi-

nally, false positives were removed by inspection of the
output of k-means clustering on the feature vectors.

FIG. 4 summarizes the results of this experiment. The
top row shows the first (FIG. 4(a)), middle (FIG. 4(b)),
and last (FIG. 4(c)) images from the time series at full
spatial resolution. The colored boxes in the full resolu-
tion images indicate regions where we have cropped the
data and displayed the entire time series in a 300 nm
region around four emitters (FIG. 4(d-g)). FIG. 4(d)
shows an emitter that is suddenly activated by the elec-
tron beam (indicated by the truncated disc shape of the
emitter), remains in the emissive state for 5 frames, then
suddenly switches off for the remainder of the time se-
ries. FIG. 4(e-f) show emitters that switch on and off
several times throughout the scan. Some of these ac-
tivation/deactivation events appear as truncated discs
(shown in detail in FIG. 4(h-i)), while some appear as
the sudden appearance or disappearance of a bright spot
from one frame to another. FIG. 4 illustrates that not
only are the emitters activated and deactivated by the
electron beam, but they also disappear and reappear in
identical spatial locations (within the accuracy of our
measurement)

We note that we have also attempted characterization
of these emitters using PL. NIMS-BN samples on indexed
Si substrates are seeded with emitters using the SEM,
characterized using CL, and then transferred to a CW PL
setup using 1 mW 349 nm, 10 mW 405 nm, and 30 mW
532 nm excitation focused to a diffraction limited spot.
No emission is observed in the Uv-Vis range using the

Elapsed time (seconds)(a)(c)(b)(d)(e)(f)(g)activationdeactivationscan direction(j)(h)(i)5101520available excitation energies and intensities within rea-
sonable integration times. This fact, in conjunction with
the activation/deactivation behavior observed under the
electron beam, hints that the origin of this emission is
associated with the charge state of an electron irradi-
ated point defect, similar to SPE in other semiconductor
systems35 -- 37.

Furthermore, we note that the Blue 435 nm emission is
not observed using PL or CL in any samples of commer-
cial h-BN powder. This implies that the new emission
may be closely related to the unique synthetic origin of
NIMS-BN.

IV. DISCUSSION

We consider possible mechanisms for the new emission.
We immediately rule out the direct creation of defects
via knock-on damage and electron-beam-induced heat-
ing. The electron energy threshold for knock-on damage
in h-BN is in the range of 70-80 keV38,39, far greater than
the 1-10 keV energy range of the SEM beam. Electron-
beam-induced heating is unlikely due to the high thermal
conductivity of h-BN along with the relatively low cur-
rent of the electron beam.

The change in temperature of the sample can be
estimated40 assuming that energy from the electron beam
is uniformly deposited in a sphere of radius R using
∆T = 3IVf /2πRκ, where I is the beam current, V is
the beam accelerating voltage, f is the fraction of inci-
dent energy that is absorbed, and κ is the thermal con-
ductivity of h-BN (600 W/m K). Assuming that 100%
of the incoming power is absorbed in a spherical inter-
action volume of radius R = 30 nm, a 2 keV electron
beam with 1 nA of current causes a temperature increase
of ∆T = 0.05 K. This value would be even lower at
increased accelerating voltage41 because the interaction
size scales approximately as V1.75. Furthermore, due to
the finite thickness of an h-BN flake, the fraction of en-
ergy from the beam deposited into the sample decreases
at higher beam energies.

We propose that the origin of this new emitter is
electron-beam-induced defect chemistry, outlined in FIG.
5. The as-synthesized NIMS-BN crystal has some initial
concentration of vacancies and intercalated interstitials,
illustrated in the cartoon in FIG. 5(a). Electron beam
induced diffusion increases the mobility of the intersti-
tials causing the impurities to diffuse towards the nat-
urally occurring vacancies within the material, resulting
in the interstitial and vacancy combining into a defect
complex42,43 (FIG. 5(b)). We propose that the activa-
tion/deactivation behavior results from electron beam in-
duced charge state switching of the color centers, similar
to previous observations of NV centers in diamond44. In
our model, the electron beam modifies the charge state
of the defect causing it to change from a non-emissive
to an emissive state, resulting in the production of pho-
tons (FIG. 5(c)). The charge state of the defect can also

6

be modified in the opposite sense, resulting in emitters
switching on and off during a measurement. We do not
see any evidence of emitters switching or blinking to a
different emission band in our experiments. This effect
would be fairly obvious in the SIs and would appear as
a distinct component, complementary to the one shown
in FIG. 3(c) and 3(d). The spatial loading would appear
as a collection of point-like emitters accompanied by a
set of truncated disks (truncated in the opposite sense
compared those in FIG. 3(c)).

This change in charge state has two possible origins.
One scenario is that incident beam and secondary elec-
trons are captured by the defect complex, resulting in a
negative charge state. Alternatively, the incident or sec-
ondary electrons ionize the defect, resulting in a positive
charge state. Currently, neither possibility can be ex-
cluded suggesting future experiments and calculations.
Previous studies have shown that a low energy elec-
tron beam can cause diffusion of impurities or vacan-
cies, vacancy-impurity defect reconstruction, and charge
state switching in other wide band gap semiconductors.
While speculative, our proposed model is consistent with
previous findings of electron beam induced luminescent
diamond NV centers45.

We propose that this emission has not been previously
observed in h-BN for several reasons. Past studies of
color centers in h-BN have typically not used NIMS-BN
which has a unique synthetic origin, but rather commer-
cially obtained h-BN. We surmise that the Ba-B-N sol-
vent precursor used in the NIMS-BN synthesis could pro-
duce barium impurities in these samples, which would
not be present in commercially obtained material syn-
thesized using different growth precursors. Under the
assumptions of our model, the new emission would not
be observed in the absence of this unique impurity. PL
studies of color centers in h-BN that do use NIMS-BN
have used a 532 nm laser excitation to probe the sample
and have focused on light emission in a high wavelength
range. This excitation energy is too low to probe a state
that emits at 435 nm.
It is likely that the charge re-
combination dynamics in this regime are dominated by
non-radiative transitions. It is possible that the 435 nm
emission is only present using CL because of the large
number of electron-hole pairs created per incident elec-
tron, as well as the high intensity of the electron probe.
A final, more speculative reason that this emission has
not been observed to date is the possibility that the par-
ticular defect complex responsible for the emission needs
the high energy density of the electron beam in order to
drive interstitial-vacancy recombination.

Our experimental results of the spectral and spatial
character of this new emitter in h-BN show many fea-
tures observed in quantum emitters, suggesting that this
new color center is a potential source of single photons.
The emission is highly localized, spectrally pure, exhibits
a ZPL with phonon replicas, and can be modified with
an electron beam, all features of SPEs in other solid state
systems. The bunching behavior seen in the g(2) (τ ) mea-

surement, while not proof of single photon emission, is
not inconsistent with electron beam induced light emis-
sion from an ensemble of quantum emitters. While all ob-
servations are consistent with the behavior of a two-level-
like system capable of single photon emission, further
study is required to unambiguously confirm the quantum
nature of this emitter.

and has spectral characteristics indicative of weak lattice
coupling. The electron beam activates and deactivates
emission from point defects in the crystal. We propose
that this emission originates from a barium atom inter-
stitial impurity forming a defect complex with a vacancy
driven by the energy of the electron beam. The charge
state of this defect is changed by the electron beam re-
sulting in the emitters switching on and off.

Figure 5. Proposed model for formation and activation of
blue color centers in NIMS-BN. The as-synthesized material
has some intrinsic density of interstitial impurities and lattice
vacancies, as shown in (a). When stimulated by the electron
beam, the impurity atoms are driven into the vacancies and
due to the energy provided by the beam a substitutional de-
fect complex is formed. The charge state of the new defect is
changed by the beam causing it to emit photons. The charge
state of the defect is sensitive to the intense stimulus from
the electron probe and can jump between emissive and non-
emissive states, resulting in a blinking effect.

V. CONCLUSION

We have identified a new color center unique to high-
quality hexagonal boron nitride using cathodolumines-
cence in the SEM. The emission is peaked at 435 nm
