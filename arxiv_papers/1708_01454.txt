Recent  advances  towards  spin-based  quantum  computation  have  been  primarily 

fuelled by elaborate isolation from noise sources, such as surrounding nuclear spins 
and  spin-electric  susceptibility1-4,  to  extend  spin  coherence.  In  the  meanwhile, 
addressable  single-spin  and  spin-spin  manipulations  in  multiple-qubit  systems  will 
necessitate  sizable  spin-electric  coupling5-7.  Given  background  charge  fluctuation  in 
nanostructures,  however,  its  compatibility  with  enhanced  coherence  should  be 
crucially questioned8-10. Here we realise a single-electron spin qubit with isotopically-
enriched  phase  coherence  time  (20 s)11,12  and  fast  electrical  control  speed  (up  to 
30 MHz) mediated by extrinsic spin-electric coupling. Using rapid spin rotations, we 
reveal that the free-evolution dephasing is caused by charge (instead of conventional 

magnetic) noise featured by a 1/f spectrum over seven decades of frequency. The qubit 

nevertheless exhibits superior performance with single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 

99.9%  on  average.  Our  work  strongly  suggests  that  designing  artificial  spin-electric 

coupling with account taken of charge noise is a promising route to large-scale spin-
qubit systems having fault-tolerant controllability.

Single  electron  spins  confined  in  quantum  dots  (QDs)  constitute  a  promising 
semiconductor platform for spin-based quantum computing. A wide variety of devices11-
20,  have  been  examined  in  a  quest  for  higher  quality  factor,  Q  –  the  number  of  qubit 

operations  available  before  coherence  is  lost.  Fault-tolerant  universal  gates  in  this 
system21,22  would  comprise  a  sequence  of  several  single-qubit  operations  and  require 
*)  and  a  short 

single-qubit  Q   1000.  Q  benefits  both  from  a  long  dephasing  time  (T2

manipulation  time  (T),  between  which  a  coherence-controllability  trade-off  has  been 

experimentally identified. 

 

Unlike  charge,  a  single  spin  does  not  couple  directly  to  electric  noise,  so 

dephasing is predominated by magnetic noise, typically from surrounding nuclear spins. 

A major approach to improve Q has therefore been engineering host materials to enhance 
* by suppressing magnetic fluctuations. With the ultimate development of isotopically 
T2
purified  devices11,12,  Q  reaches ~  100,  achieved  by  slow  spin  manipulation  as  a 

manifestation of the coherence-controllability trade-off. Note that now the spin dephasing 

mechanism  becomes controversial, with  no longer apparent  magnetic  fluctuators – but 

there is no convincing experimental  study that elucidates non-magnetic  dephasing. On 

the other hand, an approach to increase Q by shortening T has been commonly pursued 

in  materials  with  large  intrinsic  spin-electric  coupling  (SEC),  e.g.  narrow-bandgapped 
semiconductors15,16,  bent  nanotubes17  and  holes  in  silicon20.  While  this  will  promote 
individual  accessibility6,7,  realising  Q  >  100  in  such  structures  has  also  proven 
*  is  degraded  by  isotopically-purified  material 

challenging  due  to  the  trade-off;  T2

standards. 

 

Our  work  strikes  a  balance  between  controllability  (short  T)  and  coherence 
*) at an isotopically-enhanced level in order to go beyond the above described 

(long T2

approaches, and reveals the coherence limited by electrical charge noise. We introduce 
"artificial" SEC fields with local magnets5,14 to an isotopically-clean silicon QD qubit, 
* while reducing T by two orders of magnitude. 

only to the extent that it barely affects T2

Fast spin rotations allow us to unveil that, as a result of inducing SEC in the absence of 

nuclear spins, the free-evolution dephasing of the spin is caused solely by 1/f charge noise 

at least up to the sub-MHz range. This is in marked contrast to conventional dephasing 
due to magnetic noise sources featured with higher spectral exponents12-17. With the Rabi 

oscillation Q reaching 888, we demonstrate > 99.9% average single-qubit control fidelity. 

 
The experiment is performed on an electron spin confined in a 28Si/SiGe QD by 

 

2 

applying electrical pulses to initialise, control and read out the qubit state (Fig. 1a,b and 

Methods).  Our  qubit  device  is  equipped  with  a  proximal  micro-magnet  which  induces 

SEC fields both in the "transverse" and "longitudinal" coupling directions (Fig. 1c). The 
transverse  field  slope  btrans  mediates  rapid  electrical  spin  rotations19,23,  while  the 

longitudinal slope blong provides electrical tunability of the qubit frequency, which would 
be useful for selective manipulation and non-demolition dispersive readout6,7. Aside from 

improving qubit controllability, these SEC fields mediate dephasing in combination with 
the  fluctuating  electrical  field  (charge  noise),  Erms  ~ 0.1 V/cm  typically9,10.  In  our 

nuclear-spin-free  device,  this  otherwise  negligible  effect  will  become  relevant.  To  still 

benefit  from  isotopic  purification  would  require  blong  <<  3 mT/nm  (Supplementary 

Materials), assuming the orbital energy spacing orb ~ 1 meV. We therefore pattern our 
Co  micro-magnet24  such  that  blong  ~  0.2 mT/nm,  which  in  practice  limits  btrans  to 

~ 1.0 mT/nm. 

 

To  first  demonstrate  enhanced  transverse  SEC,  we  drive  electric  dipole  spin 

resonance  (EDSR).  When  the  control  microwave  is  exactly  on  resonance,  the  spin-up 

probability Pup shows a so-called Rabi oscillation as a function of the microwave duration. 

Figure 1d  shows  16.6  MHz  oscillations,  whose  decaying  time  is  too  long  to  measure 

within forty  π  rotations. The decaying time of 3.9 MHz Rabi oscillations is 1133 s, 

yielding the Rabi oscillation Q = 888 (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The rotation frequency 

increases  proportionally  to  the  microwave  amplitude  up  to  approximately  20 MHz 

(Fig. 1e), above which faster oscillation damping is observed (Supplementary Fig. 2a). A 

nearly-ideal EDSR rotation in the linear regime is further verified by the chevron pattern 

(Fig. 1f); the pattern reflects the qubit spin rotation along a tilted axis in the Bloch sphere 

with deliberately detuned microwave excitation. 

 

We next quantify a longitudinal SEC field in the device. This is performed by 

applying an additional bump pulse to gate R in the control stage, during which the qubit 

precession  frequency is rapidly shifted (Fig.  2a). Figure 2b shows the  resulting  phase-

shift-induced  oscillations  of  Pup  lasting  20 s  with  no  indication  of  decay.  The  phase 

rotation speed grows linearly with the bump amplitude VR, yielding a frequency-shift 

lever-arm of 93 kHz/mV. Note that the maximum shift (5.2 MHz) is limited by the pulse-

generating hardware and induced within the same equilibrium charge occupation. 

 

A crucial question, given the enhanced electrical controllability, is whether the 

isotopically-enhanced spin coherence survives the induced size of SEC. We reveal this by

measuring T2

*  =  20 s,  consistent  with  the  EDSR  spectral  width  (Fig. 3b).  This  T2

compatibility of the SEC-enhanced controllability and the isotope-purified coherence. It

also  suggests  that  T2
(refs. 18,19) is limited by the fluctuating nuclear-spin field due to 5% 29Si. 

 

To  further  study  phase  coherence  of  our  qubit,  we  employ  Carr-Purcell-
Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) protocols26,27. Such dynamical decoupling controls can partially 

cancel the dephasing effect, with efficacy strongly dependent on the qubit noise spectral

density, S(f). The CPMG coherence time, T2

time twait. Note that in the following we normalise ACPMG by the estimated measurement 

visibility  for  each  number  of    pulses,  n.  When  n  =  1,  it  is  essentially  a  Hahn  echo 

sequence, and the measured coherence time is 99 s (Fig. 3c). 

 
When n is sequentially increased as n = 21, 22…, 210, ACPMG always takes the

the exponent   0.5260.011 (Fig. 4a inset). We furthermore relate ACPMG to S(f) using 
the filter function formalism for Gaussian noise26, and obtain (Supplementary Materials) 
for n ≳ 8, 

 
Figure 4b plots S(f) calculated from Eq. (1) for n ≥ 8 and 0.15 < ACPMG < 0.85. All data 
points  nicely  follow  a  power  law  1/f    in  the  frequency  range  of  13  to  320  kHz,  with 

𝑆(𝑛π/2𝑡wait) ≃ −ln(𝐴CPMG) /2𝜋2𝑡wait.

  1.010.05.  From  this  simple  power-law  spectrum,  we  obtain    1  2.01  and 

  1  , both of which agree well with the independent fitting results to the 
CPMG  scaling  described  above.  Such  1/f  charge  noise  has 
ACPMG  envelopes  and  the  T2
commonly been observed in electrical properties in semiconductor devices8-10 and is also 

measured as current fluctuations in our device (Supplementary Fig. 1). 

 

We can independently estimate S(f) around 0.01-1 Hz by tracking Ramsey fringe 
dynamics28 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Materials). Surprisingly enough, the results fall 

on the extended line of the noise spectrum revealed by CPMG at tens of kHz. This means 

that the 1/f charge noise constitutes the only dominant source of spin phase noise in this 
* of 25 s,  in 

device over seven decades of frequency. Indeed, this scenario predicts T2

excellent agreement with the value measured directly (Supplementary Materials). 

 

As  a  concluding  test  of  how  SEC  enhances  the  qubit  performance,  we 
characterise  single-qubit  control  fidelities  based  on  randomized  benchmarking29  (see 

Methods). As the number of applied Clifford gates m increases, the standard sequence 
m,  with  the  visibility  V  =  0.712  and  the  depolarising 

fidelity  (Fig. 5)  decays  as  VpC

parameter pC = 0.997210.00009. This corresponds to the single Clifford gate fidelity of 

99.8610.005% and the average single gate fidelity of 99.9260.002%, which give nearly 
an-order-of-magnitude smaller error rates than the best values reported in QDs11,19 and 
well exceed the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing21. 

 

We also evaluate the fidelity of each single-qubit operation individually through 

the interleaved benchmarking (Methods). The obtained fidelity curves (Fig. 5) are then 
fitted with V(pCpG)m, yielding the gate fidelity as (1+pG)/2. The average value of fidelities 

99.928% is consistent with the value from the standard sequence. We speculate that the 

gate  fidelities  are  limited  by  systematic  pulse  calibration  errors  rather  than  dephasing 

effects, since the fidelities for half  rotations are strongly sign dependent. 

 

To  conclude,  designing  SEC  in  QD  spin  qubits  is  a  viable  approach  to  meet 

antithetic requirements for high electrical controllability and isotopically-enriched spin 

coherence. In this approach, 1/f charge noise can become the exclusive source of free-

evolution dephasing of a single spin, and the qubit performance may be further enhanced 

by  improving  the  electrical  stability.  Qubit  control  fidelity  exceeding  99.9%  strongly 

underpins  the  prospects  for  fault-tolerant  universal  quantum  computation  in  this 

architecture.

(a) Device layout. Circles indicate approximate positions of a qubit and a charge sensing 

QD. We typically apply an external magnetic field Bext of around 0.5 T so that the Larmor 

precession  frequency  is  roughly  18 GHz  (the  optimal  frequency  for  the  set-up  of  our 

control  circuit).  (b)  Control  pulse  sequence.  Waveforms  are  applied  to  gate  electrode

induce  a  spatially 

inhomogeneous  stray  field  BMM  at  the  QD  position  when  magnetised  along  Bext.  The 

transverse coupling is produced by the inhomogeneous component perpendicular to Bext 
and  is  proportional  to  the  field  slope  btrans = (𝑒⃗ ⋅ ∇)𝐵MM

Figure 2  Longitudinal SEC characterisation. 

 

(a) Schematic representation of pulse sequences used to evaluate the longitudinal SEC. 

To  detect  the  pulse-induced  phase,  we  use  three  equidistant  EDSR  rotations  around  a 

fixed axis (x): /2X  X  /2X. The first and the last /2 rotations together map the phase 

accumulated  between  them  to  a  measurable  spin  component.  For  a  phase  shift,  for 

example, an electron initialised in the spin-down state ends up in the spin-up state after 

the pulse sequence. By inserting a  π-flip midway, the signal becomes robust against a 

static,  microwave  detuning  effect.  (b)  Oscillation  due  to  phase  rotation  for  pulse 

amplitudes  VR  =  15,  35  and  55  mV.  Measurement  data  with  control  pulse  lengths 

between 0 and 4 s or between 16 and 20 s are shown. Solid curves are the fits with a 

sinusoidal  function  with  a  phase  offset  (common  to  both  regions).  The  oscillation 

frequency gives the size of the induced qubit-frequency shift. The traces are offset by 1 

for clarity. (c) Pulse amplitude dependence of the extracted frequency shift. The solid line

extrinsic spectral broadening, a three-ms-long, Gaussian-envelope burst is used. Note that 

the peak height is limited due to the slow Rabi frequency (estimated to be ~ 1 kHz). (c)

Methods   

 

The  Device.  The  Si/SiGe  heterostructure  was  grown  by  gas-source  molecular  beam 
epitaxy. An isotopically  purified silane source  (with a residual  concentration of  29Si at 

around 800 ppm) was used exclusively for the strained well. The QD and the bottom of 

the 250-nm-thick on-chip micro-magnet are separated by ~ 170 nm and designed in line 

with ref. 24. Carriers are induced in the well with a global top-gate electrode and further 

lateral confinement is provided by individually biasing surface metal gates. We confirm 

the valley splitting is much larger than the Zeeman splitting from magneto-spectroscopy 

measurements. 

 

Measurement pulses. We apply two-stage pulses to gate R for spin initialisation, control 

and  readout  as  shown  in  Fig. 1b,  except  for  longitudinal  SEC  characterisation 

measurements (Fig. 2a). The typical readout time is ~ 1 ms, as we tune the QD-reservoir 

tunnel  rate  to  around  10 kHz.  In  the  initialisation  and  readout  stage,  the  centre  of  the 

Zeeman-split energy levels in the QD is aligned to the chemical potential in the reservoir. 

Then, only the excited spin-up electron will tunnel out, and only the ground spin-down 

electron will tunnel in. We detect such tunnelling events by thresholding charge sensor 

reflectometry signals, to measure the qubit spin state in a single-shot manner. During the 

control stage, on the other hand, both spin sublevels in the QD are plunged energetically 

far  below  to  prevent  population  leakage.  During  spin  manipulation,  the  measurement 

reflectometry carrier power is blanked. 

 

Clifford  benchmarking  protocol.  Randomized  benchmarking  protocols  apply 

sequences of randomly chosen gates from some group and map the error probability to 

the  fidelity  decay  rate  as  a  function  of  sequence  length.  In  the  standard  randomized 

benchmarking, after initialisation in a spin-down state, we apply m successive Clifford 

gates, which are randomly chosen to twirl gate errors. In the interleaved benchmarking, 

we insert an additional test gate between randomly chosen Clifford gates. We then rotate 

the  spin  state  such  that  the  output  ideally  becomes  one  of  the  target  spin  states,  up  or 
down29. We  calculate  the  difference  of  the  spin-up  probabilities  Pup  between  the  two 

target-state  cases  with  each  based  on  1000  single-shot  measurements.  Each  sequence 

fidelity value is obtained by averagingPup over 20 different random Clifford gate sets. 
The sequence fidelity then decays as (2F – 1)m with F denoting the average fidelity per 

step. 

 

 

Each of the 24 gates in the Clifford gate set is constructed by concatenating on 

14 

average 1.875 single-qubit physical gates of 7 kinds,  and /2 rotations around the x 

and  y  axes  and  an  identity  operation.  To  implement  the  physical  gates,  we  use  two-

quadrature EDSR microwave pulses. On the main quadrature, we feed Gaussian envelope 

bursts truncated at ± 2 denotes the standard deviation On the second quadrature, we 

simultaneously  apply  the  derivative-of-Gaussian  envelope  pulses  to  account  for  the 

control-induced frequency shift. These pulse amplitudes are individually optimized for  

and  /2  gates.  The  pulse  durations  (4)  are  120  and  60 ns  for  the    and  /2  gates, 

respectively, due to pulse-shaping hardware limitation.

1.  Details of the experimental setup 

 

The device was cooled in a dilution refrigerator with an electron temperature of 

around 100 mK (estimated from the charging line width). The high-frequency electrical 

cable connected to gate R was coupled to a DC bias through resistive dividers at room 

temperature  and  was  then  filtered  inside  the  refrigerator  with  a  cut-off  frequency  of 

~ 100 MHz. Gate pulse signals were generated by Tektronix AWG520. The other high-

frequency cable for gate C was designed for a bandwidth of 20 GHz. For microwave pulse 

shaping, we used either analogue (pulse and phase) modulations (for higher powers) or 

digital,  quadrature  modulation  (for  narrower  spectral  broadening).  These  modulations 

were  realised  by  feeding  two-channel  waveform  signals  from  Tektronix  AWG7122C, 

triggered by Tektronix AWG520 during the control stage. The microwave was generated 

by Agilent generators E8257D or E8267D (depending on pulse shaping schemes). 

 

We formed a tank circuit resonating at 185 MHz on the device printed circuit 

board.  Reflected  RF  charge-sensing  signals  were  collected  with  AlazarTech  digitizer 

ATS9440 at 1 MS/s after demodulation. Single-shot spin measurements were performed 

by thresholding the maximum signal level with respect to the median value during the 

measurement stage. This readout thresholding value and the readout gate  voltage were 

calibrated almost hourly prior to measurements such that the Rabi oscillation visibility 

would  be  maximised.  The  microwave  carrier  frequency  was  also  calibrated  similarly 

often  based  on  Ramsey  fringes  to  compensate  for  a  systematic  decrease  of  the  EDSR 

frequency.  We  believe  that  this  drift  is  primarily  due  to  the  field  decay  of  the 

superconducting  magnet  operated  in  persistent  mode  (while  also  sending  a  current 

through the external leads). 

 

2.  Charge-noise-induced spin dephasing mediated by a longitudinal SEC 

 

1/f  charge  noise  is  commonly  observed  in  nano-electronic  devices,  and  could 
arise from a variety of mechanisms8-10. For QDs based on semiconductor heterostructures, 

charge traps near interfaces are typically believed to be the leading source. Exposure to 

SEC will couple the qubit spin to such electric field noise, to which the pure electron spin 

 

16 

would  be  insensitive.  More  specifically,  fluctuating  in-plane  electric  field  δ𝐸rms  will 
displace the QD position by 

δ𝑟rms =

ℎ2𝑒

4𝜋2𝑚SiΔorb

2 δ𝐸rms  , 

where  ℎ  is  Planck's  constant,  e  is  the  single  electron  charge,  and  mSi  is  the  electron 

effective mass in Si (~ 0.2 m0 with m0 the electron rest mass). We have assumed an in-

plane  symmetric  harmonic  confinement  potential,  characterised  by  the  orbital  spacing 
Δorb. In electrically controlled QDs, the size of fluctuating electric potential  δ𝑉rms has 
been  conventionally  measured  instead  of δ𝐸rms,  with  a  typical  value  of  ~ 1 μeV8-10. 
Given that this level of potential noise is generated by an ensemble of interface charge 
traps located typically  𝑑trap ~ 100  nm away from the QD9,   

δ𝐸rms ~  𝛿𝑉𝑟𝑚𝑠/(𝑒𝑑trap) ~ 0.1 V/cm. 

This corresponds to  δ𝑟rms = 4 pm  for  Δorb = 1 meV. The QD displacement will shift 
the qubit frequency via a longitudinal SEC field by 

δ𝑓𝐸 =  𝑔𝜇B𝑏longδ𝑟rms/ℎ, 

where g ~ 2 is the Landé g-factor in Si. We note that since Bext is much larger than the 

size of stray field, the dephasing will be nominally mediated by the longitudinal one. To 
benefit  from  isotopic  purification,  this  charge-noise-induced  detuning  fluctuation  δ𝑓𝐸 
should  be  safely  smaller

3.  Charge noise spectrum in the device 

 

We  evaluate  the  spectrum  of  the  device  charge  noise  by  recording  the 

demodulated RF amplitude of the sensor signal for 0.5 sec. We divide the trace into 25 

parts (the Bartlett method) and calculate the average power spectral density (Figure S1). 

The procedure is repeated for cases where the sensor sensitivity is maximal and minimal 

(tuned to a Coulomb slope and valley). The obtained spectra in a frequency range of 10 – 

1000 Hz show clear evidence of 1/f charge noise in the device. 

 

4.  Rabi oscillation decay at moderate and strongest driving powers 

 

 

The  Rabi  oscillation  Q-factor  is  a  key  parameter  to  quantify  the  spin-qubit 

17 

controllability and can be defined as Q = T2

Rabi/T T2

Rabi fRabi, where T2

Rabi denotes the 

characteristic decaying time of the Rabi oscillation and 1/T = 2fRabi is the  rotation time. 
Rabi and fRabi should ideally increase as we raise the microwave amplitude, 

While both T2

it is evident from Figure 1e of the main text that fRabi does not linearly grow above 20 MHz 

in the present device. Furthermore, when the spin is driven in this saturating range, we 

observe faster Rabi oscillation decay (Figure S2a). These observations imply that the Rabi 

oscillation Q-factor  would be peaked at  some  fRabi value, which would be an educated 
estimate of an optimal working point to enhance the control fidelity19. In our current setup 

for randomised benchmarking experiments, however, the maximum applicable amplitude 

is decreased by the conversion loss of an additional mixer for quadrature control (Marki 

Microwave MLIQ-0218), making maximum fRabi ~ 4 MHz, far below saturation. The Rabi 

oscillation quality factor for fRabi = 3.93 MHz is evaluated to be Q = 888 (Figure S2b). 

 

5.  Frequency-domain measurement of in-situ qubit-frequency shift 

 

In  this  section  we  describe  a  measurement  of  the  qubit-frequency  shift  in  the 

spectral domain, as opposed to the one in the time domain (Figure 2 in the main text). We 

obtain the resonance frequency fres at different operation biases by changing the control 

pulse amplitude VR (see Figure S3a). We measure frequency-dependence of Pup under a 

 pulse (we fix the Rabi frequency fRabi to 1 MHz and the microwave duration to 500 ns) 

and fit the obtained spectra to a model function for an ideal  rotation, 

𝐴 𝜋 sinh(𝐷(𝑓)) /2𝐷(𝑓)2 + 𝐵 

where  𝐷(𝑓) =

π

2

√i[(𝑓 − 𝑓res)/𝑓Rabi]2 − 1,  and  A  and  B  account  for  initialisation  and 

readout errors (Figure S3b). Figure S3c plots the extracted fres values as a function of VR, 

from which we get a gate lever-arm of 91.1 kHz/mV for gate R. While, strictly speaking, 

this measures the steady-state frequency shift, a consistent value is obtained for the real-

time modulation as well (see the main text). 

 

6.  Calculations of noise spectral content

spectral density of detuning frequency noise  ν(𝑡) or

with  〈⋅〉  denoting the statistical average. If the distribution of  𝜈(𝑡′)  is Gaussian, random

sequence specific function  𝜃𝑡(𝑡′), which switches between  ±1  at every decoupling  
pulse and is 0 before and after the sequence26. Then the coherence amplitude is given by

For decoupling pulses,  𝐹 𝑡(𝑓)  effectively behaves as a band-passing filter. By

𝜏𝑛𝜋+1 = 𝑡), for even numbered CPMG we have26

quadratically. Noting from Parseval's theorem that

ln(exp[〈𝑖𝜙(𝑡)〉]) =   −4𝜋2 ∫ d𝑓 𝑆(𝑓) 𝐹𝑡(𝑓)

∞

≃ −2𝜋2𝑡 𝑆(𝑓rep/2). 

 

For Ramsey experiments (𝑛𝜋 = 0),  lim

𝐹 𝑡(𝑓) = 𝑡2. Then for 1/f noise  𝑆(𝑓) =

𝑆0/𝑓, Eq.(S2) reduces to

(S3) 

Here  t  is  the  evolution  time  and  T  is  given  by  the  total  measurement  time,  typically 

~ 100 sec in our case (Fig. 3a of the main text). Then the logarithmic factor is ~ 15 when 
t  is  tens  of  microseconds.  Assuming  𝑆0 =  2.67 × 106   as  extracted  from  CPMG 
∗ = 24.8 μs  for  𝑡 = 20 μs, in excellent agreement with 
coherence amplitudes, we get  𝑇2
the value obtained independently from Ramsey fringes. 

 

The discrete version of Eq. (S1) provides another way of estimating  𝑆(𝑓)  based 

on Ramsey  sequences, which we employ in  Figure 4c of the  main  text. Supposing we 
have a sequence of  𝜈(𝑡𝑛)  of a length N with a sampling lag of  𝑡d, the discrete version 
of  𝑆(𝑓)  is 

𝑆d(𝑓𝑘) =   

𝑡d
𝑁

 ∑ 𝜈(𝑡𝑛) e−2πi𝑓𝑘𝑡d

𝑁

𝑛=1

where  𝑓𝑘 = 𝑘/𝑁𝑡d. It is known that the average of  𝑆d(𝑓𝑘)  for M sets of such sequences 
will asymptotically tend to  𝑆(𝑓). To perform this spectral estimation, we infer detuning 

values  from  Ramsey  fringes  based  on  200  single  shot  measurements  in  total 
(corresponding to a sampling lag of0.4 seconds) using a Bayesian estimation method28. 

We  use  evolution  times  between  0.4  and  40  s  and  repeat  the  cycle  3600  times 
continuously with  (𝑀, 𝑁) = (12, 300).

Fourier  transformation  on  25  traces  of  the  sensor  signal  when  the  sensor  is  tuned  to  a

it is exceeded by the background noise floor (blue trace).
