Abstract

Density functional calculations were performed to systematically study a series of finite and

infinite cluster-assembled silicon nanotubes (SiNTs). One-dimensional SiNTs can be prepared by

proper assembly of hydrogenated cage-like silicon clusters to form semiconductors with a large

band gap, and their electronic properties can be accurately tuned by transition metal doping

in the center of the tubes. Specifically, doping with Fe made the SiNTs metallic and magnetic

materials. More interestingly, a metal to half-metal transition was observed with increasing tube

radius in Fe-doped SiNTs, which demonstrates that SiNTs doped with magnetic elements may find

important applications in spintronics.

Keywords: Hydrogenated silicon clusters, HOMO-LUMO gap order, cluster-assembled nanotube,

INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery and application of carbon fullerenes and carbon nanotubes(CNTs) [1],

stable cage and tube-like structures have attracted a great deal of attention. These structures

have generated great interest in creating analogous structures from other elements that are

suitable for applications in nanodevices. Silicon and carbon are members of the same group

in the periodic table, suggesting a potential ability to form similar structures. Furthermore,

due to the fundamental importance of silicon in present-day integrated circuits, substantial

efforts have focused on investigating nano-scale forms of silicon, both for the purpose of

further miniaturizing the current microelectronic devices and in the hopes of unveiling new

properties that often arise at the nano-scale level[2]. However, it is difficult to form cages

or tubes like carbon fullerenes or nanotubes purely with Si atoms because silicon does not

favor the sp2 hybridization that carbon does. Carbon normally forms strong π bonds through

sp2 hybridization, which can facilitate the formation of two-dimensional spherical cages (or

planar structures such as benzene and graphene). Silicon, on the other hand, usually forms

covalent σ bonds through sp3 hybridization, which favor a three dimensional diamond-like

structure.

Fortunately, Si cage clusters can be synthesized by adding suitable foreign atoms to termi-

nate the dangling Si bonds that inherently arise in cage-like networks. Many researchers[3 -- 5]

reported that transition metal(TM) atoms are the most suitable element for cage formation

due to their d band features. In addition, rare earth atoms have been doped into silicon

cages[6 -- 9]. Another way to stabilize the Si cage is to use hydrogens to terminate the cluster

surface[10, 11], which is similar to the dodecahedral C20H20.

Several hollow and nonhollow silicon nanotube structures have been proposed and theo-

retically characterized in recent years [12 -- 38]. These structures, which were proposed based

on intuition or the behavior of similar materials, include the following:

(1) Regular polyhedron stacking nanotubes [12],

(2) Surface capped polygonal prism stacking nanotubes [13],

(3) Polycrystalline forms of nanowires [14],

(4) Metal encapsulated polygonal prism nanotubes [15 -- 20],

(5) Carbon nanotube like structures [21 -- 27],

(6) Fullerene-based structures [28, 29],

2

(7) Metal centered fullerene-based structures [30],

(8) Hydrogenated single-wall silicon CNT like nanotubes [31 -- 33],

(9) Exohydrogenated fullerene-like structures [34, 35],

(10) Multiwall nanotubes [36 -- 38].

In the cases of (1), (3), (5) and (6), similar to pure silicon cages, it was reported to

be difficult to form hollow single wall Si nanotubes because of the sp3 nature of Si atom.

Cases (4) and (7) proposed that metal doping may be a good way to terminate the dangling

bond of silicon bond in the tube, but this approach was limited to tubes with very small

radii(R≤1nm).

However, if the lateral surfaces of the dangling bonds are terminated by hydrogens, the

resulting cage-like silicon clusters may be perfect building blocks for Si nanotubes. The-

oretically, every Si atom has three neighboring Si atoms in the nanotube, and these have

an sp3 type bond nature with one H terminating the dangling bond. Moreover, the suc-

cess of this approach is suggested by the fact that in experiments, the surfaces of Silicon

nanowires(SiNWs) and silicon nanotubes(SiNTs) are always passivated by hydrogen atoms

[25, 39] or by silicon oxide layers [40 -- 43].

This work presents a theoretical study of hydrogenated cluster assembled silicon nan-

otubes using density functional theory(DFT) calculation. A series of finite and infinite

silicon nanotubes assembled by hydrogenated cage-like clusters was obtained. Additionally,

the electronic and magnetic properties of SiNTs can be accurately tuned by doping impuri-

ties at the center of the hollow tube. One interesting result was that a metal to half-metal

transition was observed in Fe-doped SiNTs with the increasing of tube radius.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS AND MODEL DESIGN

All theoretical computations were performed with the DFT approach implemented in

the Dmol3 package [44, 45], using all electron treatment and the double numerical basis

including the d-polarization function(DNP)[44]. The exchange-correlation interaction was

treated within the generalized gradient approximation(GGA) using BLYP functional. Self-

consistent field calculations were performed with a convergence criterion of 2×10−5 Hartree

on total energy.

The SinHn (n=16, 20, 24, 28, 32) clusters were optimized first, and some of the initial

3

structures in our work were based on the results reported in Refs. 10 & 11. After obtaining

stable single clusters, we took these clusters as basic units (keep them as original) and stacked

the clusters with a certain n along the axis of symmetry to construct finite nanotubes.

For infinite one dimensional nanotubes, the periodically repeated units were placed in
supercells. The supercell is cubic in geometry with the dimensions 25A×25A×Lz, where

the direction of Lz was defined as the axial direction of the nanotubes. Periodic boundary

conditions were employed along the nanowire axis to create, in effect, continuous wires.

Meanwhile, a sufficiently large vacuum region was introduced along the other directions is

configured between the wires.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Structures of SinHn clusters and finite nanotubes

The fully optimized structures of SinHn (n=16, 20, 24, 28, 32) clusters that have been

fully optimized are shown in Fig. 1. It was very interesting to see that all these structures

shared the following common characteristics: 1. All of them were fullerene-like hollow

structures. 2. Each Si atom had three Si neighbors, with one H atom saturating the

dangling bond of each silicon atom outside the cage to fulfill an sp3 type hybridization bond.

3. All structures consisted of n

the edge number of these two polyhedrons as n

2 pentagons and two other polyhedrons at the two ends, with
4 . Meanwhile, these two polyhedrons were
n between them. Thus each vertex
atom of one polyhedron fell exactly in the middle of one edge in the other polyhedron.

parallel to each other and there was a relative angle of 4π

Specifically, for Si20H20, the cage was composed of 12 pentagons, which was very similar

to the structure of carbon fullerene C20H20. Structures of Si16H16, Si24H24 and Si28H28

have been widely discussed in very recent years [10, 11] and the structural information we

obtained was consistent with these reports.

Taking these original clusters original as basic units, we stacked them along the central

axis of the cage to form finite nanotubes. The two adjacent cages shared the same poly-

hedron. We noted that for the shared polyhedron, there was no need for have hydrogen

saturation because each Si atom already had 4 Si neighbors and thus the sp3 hybridiza-

tion bond type was fulfilled. The molecular formula of the finite tube was classified as

4

Sim(3k+1)H2m(k+1), where the measure of radius m was the number of atoms of one shared

polyhedron and the measure of length k was the number of repeated units. After full opti-

mization, for one certain value m(m=4, 5, 6, 7), and for k range from 2 to 4 concerned in

the present work, the tube was always straight and stable. Furthermore, if the number of

repeated units k was fixed, the length of the tubes decreased with the increasing m. The

angles of H-Si-Si and Si-Si-Si inside the repeated units were all about 109◦, which were very

close to the 109.5◦ of sp3 , but the Si-Si-Si angle (angle α in Fig. 2 (b)) between two units

became smaller and smaller with the increasing of tube radii (from 127.8◦ of m=4 to 99.0◦

of m=8).

Even though, the growth direction and the achievable length of the nanotubes are the

main experimental concerns, previous theoretical studies have paid little attention to these

issues. Here, we chose Si5(3k+1)H10(k+1) nanotubes to examine if straight tubes were more

stable than bent nanotubes. As shown in Fig. 2, Si50H40 (m=5, k=3)(Fig. 2 (a)) had an

isomer (a1) (Fig. 2 (a1)) that was bent to 120◦ from 180◦, but the total energy (ET ) of (a1)

was 0.02eV higher than that of the straight tube (a). Likewise, Si65H50 (m=5, k=4) has two

isomers b1(Fig. 2 (b1)) and b2 (Fig. 2(b2)), where the structure b1 was a tube in which the unit

at the end was bent, and structure b2 was distorted further. These isomers were less stable

because the total energy of (ET ) was higher than that of the linear structure by 0.021eV

or 0.034eV , respectively. For hydrogenate silicon tubes, if one tube was bent by an angle,

the distance between H atoms of adjacent units would decrease and the Coulomb repulsion

between them would makes the total energy greater than the straight energy. Consequently,

the linear structure was relatively more stable than bent structures.

B. ELECTRONIC STRUCTURES

In order to measure the relative stability of the tubes as well as the influence of the length

and width, we calculated the averaged binding energy (Eb) and dissociation energies (DE)

of these tubes. The Eb and DE for finite tubes were defined by the following formulae:

Eb(k) = {m(3k + 1)ET (Si) + 2m(k + 1)ET (H) − ET [Si3k+1H2m(k+1)]}/(5mk + 3m)

(1)

(m = 4 − 8; k = 1 − 4)

5

DE(k) = ET (SiH) − ET [Si3k+1H2m(k+1)]

(m = 4 − 8; k = 1 − 4 )

(2)

where ET (Si), ET (H), ET (SiH) and ET [Sim(3k+1)H2m(k+1)] represent the total energies of

the Si atom, H atom, SiH dimer and the Sim(3k+1)H2m(k+1) tube, respectively.

As illustrated in Fig. 3 (a), the binding energy Eb(k) of the finite tube increases gradually

as the length increased for a certain m. This correlation indicates that the tube became

increasingly stable as it became longer. On the other hand, the stability of the tubes did

not depend linearly on the tube's radius, which was represented by m. For any k, the most

stable tubes were at m=5 or m=6.

DE is the energy needed to remove a Si-H dimer from the end of a tube, and this parameter

provided another method to probe the tube stability. The curves of DE (Fig. 3 (b)) indicate

that it was more difficult to remove a Si-H dimer from the tubes with m=5 and 6 because

these two specific tubes satisfied sp3 hybridization well. This is another indication of the

fact that tubes with m=5 or 6 are the most stable.

In addition, Fig. 3 (c) plots the variation of the highest occupied molecular or-

bital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps of the finite tubes.

The quantum confinement concept demands a larger gap for a smaller size. The authors in

Ref. 10 ever argued that the quantum confinement concept was not fully applicable to satu-

rated systems such as SinHn cages. Our work also provides evidence on the limitation of the

quantum confinement concept in interpreting the gaps of hydrogenated silicon nanotubes.

As seen in Fig. 3 (c), when m is fixed, the gaps between HOMO-LUMO became smaller

with increasing length. However, there was a big jump in the gap from a single cluster to a

two-unit tube. This difference could come from a hybrid bond around the Sim cylinder joints

which was different from the fully hydrogenated silicon atoms in a single cluster. Moreover,

the Coulomb repulsion between hydrogen atoms of an adjacent unit could play a role in

defining gaps, as explained below.

The tubes of Si4(3k+1)H2×4(k+1), Si5(3k+1)H2×5(k+1) and Si6(3k+1)H2×6(k+1) had similar

HOMO-LUMO gaps due to analogous structural parameters including bond angle, length

and width. The gaps of larger radii tubes Si7(3k+1)H2×7(k+1) and Si8(3k+1)H2×8(k+1) tubes

were much smaller than those of the smaller radii tubes Si4(3k+1)H2×4(k+1), Si5(3k+1)H2×5(k+1)

6

and Si6(3k+1)H2×6(k+1). Similar to Ref. 10, we estimated the effective volume per electron
V (e)
ef f by drawing two concentric cylinders with RH and RSi in Fig. 2 (b) up to the layer of

hydrogen and silicon.

The V (e)

ef f was defined as:

V (e)
ef f =

1
Ne

× π × L [(

1
2

RH )2 − (

1
2

RSi)2]

(3)

where Ne was the number of electron and L was the length of the cylinder (Fig. 2 (b)).

V (e)
ef f is the measures of electron "confinement", which would lead to the same order of gap

performance according to the quantum confinement concept. Hence, in our work, the order
of effective volume per electron of V (e)
ef f [m=4] <
V (e)
ef f [m=5], as in Table I, would have resulted in a HOMO-LUMO gap order of ∆G [m=7]>

ef f [m=6] < V (e)

ef f [m=7] < V (e)

ef f [m=8] < V (e)

∆G [m=6] > ∆G [m=8] > ∆G [m=4] > ∆G [m=5]. However, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and

Table I, the HOMO-LUMO gap order was ∆G [m=6] > ∆G [m=4] > ∆G [m=5] > ∆G [m=7]

> ∆G [m=8]. The HOMO-LUMO gap order only followed the rule of quantum confinement

for small radii tubes(m=4, 5, 6). The limitation of quantum confinement for large radii

tubes (m=7, 8) may arise from the fact that these tubes have a smaller distance between
the H-H bonds of neighboring units(DH in Fig. 2 (b)). For example, DH of 4.206A for m=4
compared to that of 2.723A or 2.567A for m=7 or 8. That is to say, for one-dimensional finite

hydrogenated silicon nanotubes, quantum confinement only worked for small radii tubes.

To summarize, in addition to the quantum confinement, the effects of suitable bond

angle(∠α in Fig. 2 (b)), and Coulomb repulsion between H atoms also played important

roles in affecting the HOMO-LUMO gaps of Sim(3k+1)H2m(k+1) systems.

C.

INFINITE TUBES

The increased stability of finite nanotubes with an increasing number of units allowed

us to examine further the stability of the infinite nanotubes specifical with a stoichiometric

Si6mH4m. This infinite tube was built from finite Sim(3k+1)H2m(k+1) by removing a SimHm

on one side and m H atoms on the other side to form a repeated unit. Fig. 4 shows two

repeated cells of the infinite tubes with different radii. All of these tubes had the stacking

of SiH cages in common, with the wire axis lying in the center. The axis passed through

the centers of buckled Sim rings, and two adjacent cages shared one ring.

7

Full structure relaxation indicated that the infinite nanotubes had similar geometric struc-

tures to finite ones, but the tube lengths had slightly changed. The lenths of Si6×4H4×4 and
Si6×5H4×5 tubes became 0.08A and 0.11A longer than the finite ones, but for Si6×6H4×6,
Si6×7H4×7 and Si6×7H4×7 the lengths became 0.075A, 0.212A and 0.365A shorter. The tube

widths and Si-H bond lengths were almost the same as for the finite ones.

The binding energies of the infinite tube shown in Table II were slightly larger than those

of finite tubes, which meant that it was possible to synthesize tubes long enough. The silicon

tube had a relatively large band gap(∆g) (2.296eV-3.009eV), which implied that it was a

wide gap semiconductor. The band gap of the tube was inversely proportional to the radius.

The band gaps of carbon nanotubes always decrease in an oscillatory behavior with

increasing radius because of the π ∗ and σ hybridization with a small radius and a large

curvature. However, for exhydrogenated single-wall carbon nanotubes(SWCNT), the gap

decreases monotonously [46]. This difference can be easily understood by the fact that

silicon atoms have sp3-type bond properties. The band-gap trend of silicon nanotubes is

similar to that of hydrogenated SWCNTs as described in other reports [30, 32, 47] on Si

nanotubes or nanowires.

D.

IRON DOPED INFINITE TUBES

Endohedral doping is an effective way to tune the properties of cage or tube-like clusters.

Therefore, we next investigated the effect of endohedral doping on the geometric stability,

conductivity and magnetism of the silicon nanotubes. Specially, Fe doping was systemati-

cally analyzed. The stability was robust when Fe atoms were inserted at the center of the

hollow tube(Fig. 4). However, the lattice underwent a very small expansion and exiting

large band gap in silicon nanotube disappeared. Subsequently, the doped tube turned into

a metal.

In previous reports, many types of metal atoms were inserted at the center of the silicon

hollow nano-clusters [4, 5] or nanotubes [15, 16, 18, 30], but the primary role of the doping

atom was to saturate the dangling bond of silicon cages or tubes. Therefore, the central

atom had a strong hybridization with the exterior silicon cage, and the magnetic moments

always became very small, or at times completely quenched. However, in the case presented

here, the outside cage was saturated by hydrogen atoms. Thus, the Fe atom had only a weak

8

interaction with the silicon atoms. As seen in Table II, the doped tube always maintained

a relatively large magnetic moment that originated from the d-electron of the Fe atom, and

the variation of the Fe moment increased as the radius increased.

The most intriguing phenomenon occurred when the radii of the Fe-doped hydrogenated

silicon tubes increased: a metal to half-metal transition was observed from the spin resolved

density of states (DOS) for the α and β channels of nanotubes, as shown in Fig. 5. From

m=4 to m=6 (Fig. 5(a) -- (c)), both the α spin and the β spin contributed to the DOS at the

Fermi level. With the increase in m, the DOS peak of the α spin at Fermi level shifted down,

while the peak of the β spin below the Fermi level shifted up towards the Fermi level. When

it comes to m=7 (Fig. 5 (d))and m=8 (Fig. 5 (e)), the α spin states disappeared at the

Fermi level, and a band gap appeared for this spin channel. For the β spin channel, a DOS

peak still emerged at the Fermi level. In other words, the nanotube turned into an insulator

for α spin and a conductor for the β spin. From the spin-resolved DOS contributed by Fe,

Si and H atoms shown in Fig. 5(f), we found that the centered Fe atoms mainly contributed

to the total number of β spin states, and Si atoms made only very modest contributions to

the states at the Fermi level.

The above phenomenon resulted from the hybridization between Fe and silicon atoms.

For small radii of m=4, Fe atoms have a stronger hybridization with the outside silicon

atoms, but the hybridization becomes smaller as the radius increases. When m=7 and 8,

the coupling between the Fe atom and the tube becomes so weak that the Fe atom is almost

an isolated atom. Thus, the atomic properties of Fe atom were recovered to a large extent.

The electron configuration of Fe is 3d64s2. According to Pauli exclusion and Hund's rule,

five 3d electrons would occupy five d orbitals with α spin, while the last 3d electron will

occupy d orbitals with β spin. When such atoms are weakly coupled together to form a

linear chain, highly spin-polarized behavior can result.

Such behavior was also been predicted in Durgun's work[48] which found that hydro-

gen passivated silicon nanowires could exhibit the half-metallic state when decorated with

specific transition metal(TM) atoms. This situation was very similar to the half-metallicity

introduced by the weakly coupled carbon atomic chain in single-walled carbon nanotubes[49].

In this case, the carbon atoms in the chain have a very weak interactions with their neighbors

and the atomic behavior is largely recovered.

The large magnetic moments of the Fe doped silicon nanotubes and their half-metallic

9

behavior are promising for application of these materials in magnetic devices and spintronic

applications.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

A series of finite and infinite hydrogenated silicon nanotubes were systematically studied

by performing first-principles DFT-GGA calculations. Our results demonstrated that one-

dimensional SiNTs Sim(3k+1)H2m(k+1) can be built by stacking SikHk clusters along the

central axis of the cage. The finite tubes had large HOMO-LUMO gaps. When m=5 and 6,

the tubes were more stable than other sizes because these tubes had the most suitable bond

angles.

Infinite tubes had similar geometric structures to the finite tubes and presented wide gap

semiconductivity due to their large band gaps. The band gap decreased monotonously as

the radius increased. Endohedral Fe doping greatly modified the properties of the silicon

nanotubes. For example, Fe doping can tune the silicon nanotube from semiconductor to

metal. Additionally, a metal to half-metal transition was observed in Fe-doped SiNTs with

an increasing tube radius. These silicon nanotubes could be useful for nanoelectronic de-

vices. In particular, a half-metallicity of the Fe-doped silicon nanotubes may find important

application in spintronics.
