Using two pairs of lattice equations [resembling Huang's equations for bulk crystals, Proc. Roy.
Soc. A 208, 352 (1951)] deduced from a microscopic dipole lattice model taking into account
electronic polarization (EP) of ions and local field effects (LFEs) self-consistently, in-plane and out-
of-plane optical vibrations in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal BN are studied theoretically. The
three mutually independent coefficients of either pair of lattice equations are determined by a set
of three generally known quantities such as the 2D electronic and static susceptibilities and phonon
frequency, making the lattice equations very useful for calculating the lattice dynamical properties.
Explicit expressions are obtained for lattice vibrational energy density, and phonon dispersion, group
velocity and density of states. The transparent phonon dispersion relations describe the previous
numerical calculations very well, and the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon dispersion relation is
identical to the analytical expression of Sohier et al. [Nano Lett. 17, 3758 (2017)], and it expresses
the degeneracy of the LO and transverse optical (TO) modes at Γ and their splitting at finite
wavevectors due to the long-range macroscopic field. The out-of-plane phonon frequency is finite
owing to ionic EP. A 2D lattice dielectric function ǫ(k, ω) is derived -- due solely to the LO vibrations -- 
which also allows the LO phonon dispersion to be rederived simply from ǫ(k, ω) = 0, similar to the
bulk case. A 2D Lyddane -- Sachs -- Teller relation and a frequency -- susceptibility relation are obtained
for the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations, respectively, connecting the phonon frequencies to the
2D dielectric functions or susceptibilities. Using three first-principles calculated parameters, the
lattice dynamical properties are studied comprehensively, particular attention being paid to the EP
and LFEs. The ionic EP and LFEs should be included simultaneously, but otherwise neglecting
either or both causes large discrepancies to the calculated dynamical properties. The rigid-ion
model cannot properly describe the optical vibrations, which, for instance, yields a 15%-19% larger
phonon frequency and 77% smaller Born charge for in-plane motion, and an infinitely large phonon
frequency and four times larger Born charge for out-of-plane motion. With no LFEs or EP, the
LO modes display very small linear dispersion, nearly flat in the long wavelength region, which is
distinct from the LO phonon dispersion calculated after including both LFEs and EP. Furthermore,
with ionic EP included, the LFEs increase the 2D susceptibility and Born charge by two and three
times for in-plane vibrations but reduce both significantly for out-of-plane vibrations.

INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery of graphene two-dimensional (2D)
materials have become a subject of intense research due
to their novel mechanical, electronic and optical proper-
ties [1]. Monolayer (ML) hexagonal Boron nitride (hBN)
and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as
MoS2 are two types of prominent 2D binary crystals with
a similar honeycomb lattice structure to graphene. While
graphene is a purely covalent material, ML hBN is a
2D polar crystal with mixed covalent and ionic bond-
ing. Also distinct from graphene, a semimetal, 2D hBN
is an insulator with a large bandgap ∼7 eV [2, 3]. Fur-
ther, piezoelectricity occurs in ML hBN owing to inver-
sion symmetry breaking. In recent years ML hBN has
attracted intense interest due to its strong piezoelectric
response [4 -- 6], large in-plane stiffness and strong resis-
tance to stretching [3, 7 -- 9], and also its capability to
combine with graphene due to lattice match as a key

material in layered graphene/hBN heterostructure elec-
tronic devices [10, 11].

Optical phonons are key scattering partners of elec-
trons [12] and play crucial roles in carrier transport in
electronic devices.
In a polar crystal long optical lat-
tice vibrations are closely connected to the electric fields
[13]. While the macroscopic electric field E is an av-
erage field, with the averaging being made to the total
field of all the ions over a lattice cell [13, 14], the lo-
cal field on any particular ion El, as was introduced by
Lorentz, is the total electric field after deduction of the
contribution due to the ion itself. In a bulk polar crys-
tal the Lorentz relation connects the local and macro-
scopic fields with the macroscopic dielectric polarization
P, El = E + 4πP/3 [13, 14], where the last term is the
inner field [13]. The electric field acting on each ion of
the crystal polarizes it by inducing an electric dipole mo-
ment, thus causing electronic polarization (EP) to the
ion, or concisely ionic polarization. A treatment neglect-
ing (including) such EP is termed rigid (polarizable) ion
model, i.e., RIM and PIM. Using the Lorentz relation
whilst considering the ions to be polarizable with a mi-

croscopic model, Huang deduced a pair of equations de-
scribing the long optical vibrations of isotropic bulk crys-
tals, w = b11w + b12E, P = b21w + b22E (b12 = b21)
[13, 15, 16], where w describes the optical displacement

of the unit cell, w =p ¯m/va(u1 − u2), u1 and u2 being

the displacements of the positive and negative ions, ¯m
being their reduced mass and va the cell volume. The
lattice dielectric function can be deduced directly from
Huang's equations, allowing one to conveniently express
the b-coefficients in terms of experimentally measurable
quantities such as the static and high-frequency dielec-
tric constants ǫ0 ǫ∞ and infrared dispersion frequency
ω0 [13]. Solving Huang's equations and the equation
of electrostatics yields the longitudinal and the trans-
verse optical (LO and TO) modes, with TO phonon fre-
quency ωt equal to ω0. Further, there is a macroscopic
electrostatic field associated with the LO modes making
their frequency ωl higher than ωt, with the frequency
ratio given by the Lyddane -- Sachs -- Teller (LST) relation

[17], ωl/ωt =pǫ0/ǫ∞, which can also be rederived from

Huang's equations [13].

In experimental study [18], phonon spectra for ML
hBN on Ni and Pt have been measured by electron energy
loss spectroscopy. Phonon spectra of ML hBN are usually
calculated by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix which
is obtained by first-principles calculation, or a tight-
binding or an empirical model. Phonon spectra have
been studied for ML hBN within the local-density ap-
proximation in density functional theory (DFT) [19, 20].
As a ML of hBN can be rolled up to form a BN nan-
otube, first-principles [21] and tight-binding [22] calcula-
tions have been performed to make a comparative study
of dielectric polarizabilities [21] as well as phonon spectra
[22] of hBN MLs and nanotubes. Phonon modes of 2D
hBN calculated from first principles [3, 6, 23 -- 25] or an
empirical force constant model [26 -- 28] have been com-
pared with those of three-dimensional (3D) bulk hBN
[23, 24, 27, 28] or other 2D honeycomb materials such
as TMDs [6, 25] and group III nitrides [3].
In these
studies, there are several common features present in the
phonon spectra for ML hBN [3, 22 -- 26]: (i) the LO and
TO modes are degenerate at the Γ point but split up at
a finite wavevector with the LO mode having a higher
frequency; (ii) overbending occurs in the LO phonon dis-
persion curve so the LO modes have maximum frequency
not at Γ, but at an intermediate point away from the Bril-
louin zone edges; (iii) both TO and ZO (i.e., out-of-plane
optical) modes show a nondispersive character at long
wavelengths with a nearly constant frequency. While
most of these studies are performed by numerical meth-
ods, only few studies have used analytical approaches
[22, 25, 26]. The degeneracy has been proved to be due
to the macroscopic field's in-plane component vanishing
at zero wavevector [22], and analytical expressions have
been obtained later for the long-wavelength dispersion of
LO and TO modes [25, 26]. In Ref.[25] an LO phonon dis-
persion relation is derived using a simple model, in which
the relationship between the squared LO and TO phonon

2

frequencies for bulk materials [29, 30] is generalized and
used for the 2D materials, and the parameters in the dis-
persion relation are obtained from their first-principles
calculation so both ionic EP and LFEs are taken into
account. The analytical theory of Michel et al. [26] tack-
les the dynamical matrix, which is obtained based on a
microscopic RIM, to find the vibrational modes; while
the eigensolutions of the dynamical matrix are numeri-
cally calculated for an arbitrary wavevector, the analyt-
ical phonon dispersions are obtained for small wavevec-
tors.
In the study [26] ionic polarization has not been
accounted for, as the inclusion of EP presents a challenge
and makes it more difficult to obtain analytical solutions
to the polar optical vibrations. Equally important are
the local fields on the ions, which have been found to
be very strong in 2D hBN [31]. Further, the local fields
and EP are interdependent [13] and should be included
in a self-consistent manner, and therefore the addition
of local field effects (LFEs) makes the lattice-dynamical
solutions for a general wavevector more complicated. For
the long wavelengths, however one expects that the 2D
lattice motion can be described on a macroscopic basis,
i.e., using macroscopic quantities such as the macroscopic
field and dielectric polarization, by lattice equations like
Huang's equations for bulk crystals. Such equations need
to be deduced from a microscopic model so as to include
the intricate EP and LFEs. So far as we know, there are
no equations of motion for the macroscopic description
of the 2D lattice vibrations, and ionic EP or LFEs on the
lattice dynamical properties of the 2D crystals have not
been studied systematically. From the viewpoint of ba-
sic research, ML hBN, the structurally simplest 2D polar
crystal, provides a model system for analytically study-
ing the 2D optical vibrations and further local field and
polarizable ion effects.

In this paper, we study long wavelength optical lattice
vibrations and local field and polarizable ion effects for
ML hBN with an analytical approach. For this purpose,
we deduce lattice equations for optical vibrations using a
microscopic model that includes the ionic EP and LFEs.
We make the deduction with Huang's approach, by intro-
ducing the macroscopic field into the equation of motion
whilst constructing an equation for the macroscopic di-
electric polarization by adding up the two contributions
due to the lattice displacement and the induced electric
polarization. We solve the simultaneous lattice equations
and equation of electrostatics, rather than solve the dy-
namical matrix equations as in previous studies, to ob-
tain explicit expressions for the optical modes, which can
describe the key features of the 2D phonon modes. We
derive a 2D longitudinal lattice dielectric function ǫ(k, ω)
which also allows one to rederive the LO phonon disper-
sion simply from ǫ(k, ω) = 0. We also deduce a LST re-
lation, a 2D counterpart of the LST relation in bulk, for
in-plane motion and a frequency -- susceptibility relation
for out-of-plane motion. Using first-principles calculated
quantities we study the lattice dynamical properties for
2D hBN and discuss in great detail the local field and

polarizable ion effects.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section II, a
deduction of 2D lattice equations for in-plane and out-
of-plane motion is made, through a 2D Lorentz relation,
from a microscopic dipole lattice model including LFEs
and EP. From the lattice equations, the dispersion re-
lations of the optical modes are deduced, followed by
a derivation of the phonon group velocity and density
of states (DOS). Then the dynamical lattice dielectric
susceptibilities are derived yielding the relations relat-
ing the static and electronic susceptibilities to the a12
and c12 coefficients of the lattice equations. Further,
a 2D longitudinal lattice dielectric function is deduced
after considering the general test charge distributions,
and from it a 2D LST relation follows. In Section III,
we present results of the in-plane and out-of-plane opti-
cal vibrations in ML BN. A comparison of microscopic
quantities such as effective charges and spring force con-
stants is made, which are calculated when knowing three
quantities including the electronic and static susceptibil-
ities from independent first-principles calculations. Then
various lattice-dynamical quantities, such as the Born
charge, the phonon dispersion and the static and elec-
tronic susceptibilities, are compared with those obtained
from a RIM, with or without LFEs taken into account, to
study the EP and LFEs on the lattice dynamical prop-
erties. Finally, Section V summarizes the main results
obtained.
In Appendix A, we show that using the 2D
Clausius-Mossotti relation obtained, the unit-cell atomic
polarizability falls in an interval for in-plane or out-of-
plane polarization, which is used to evaluate the LFEs
on the phonon dispersion and 2D dielectric susceptibili-
ties. In Appendix B we show that in terms of macroscopic
theory the relations a12 = a21 and c12 = c21, which con-
nect the coefficients of the lattice equations, follow from
the principle of energy conservation. Further we obtain
a lattice-vibrational energy density as a function of the
optical displacement and electric field for in-plane or out-
of-plane vibrations.

II. THEORY

A. Equations of motion and lattice polarization

ML hBN, a 2D binary crystal with point group D3h,
is composed of two sublattices of B and N (as shown in
Fig. 1), labeled with κ = 1, 2, respectively. Let mκ and
eκ be the mass and charge of the type κ ions , and let
e1 = −e2 = ea, where ea is the static effective charge [32]
due to electron charge transfer −ea from B to N in 2D
h-BN, ea > 0 [6, 24]. The masses of the B and N atoms
are m1=10.81 Da and m2=14.01 Da. In the dipole lat-
tice model [13] each ion site of type κ is occupied by an
electric dipole pκ which arises due partly to the ionic dis-
placement uκ and partly to the induced electric moment
µκ on the ion. Associated with the long wavelength op-
tical modes, there is macroscopic dielectric polarization

3

P = (p/s)eik·ρδ(z), where p is the total dipole moment
p = p1 + p2 of a unit cell with area s = √3a2/2, a being
the lattice constant a=2.5 A (see Fig. 1). The δ function
describes the dependence of the polarization on z for a
ML in the plane z = 0. k is the 2D wave vector, and
ρ = (x, y) is the position vector in the plane parallel to
the ML.

We first consider in-plane optical vibrations; that is,
the displacements uκ and dipole moments pκ lie in the
ML plane. The macroscopic electric field E due to the
charge density −∇ · P is given by the equation of elec-
trostatics ∇ · (E + 4πP) = 0, the electric field E being
an irrotational field, E = −∇φ [φ is the electrostatic po-
tential, φ(ρ, z) = ϕ(z)eik·ρ]. To solve the corresponding
Poisson's equation ∇2φ(ρ, z) = 4πip · keik·ρδ(z)/s, we
expand ϕ(z) and δ(z),

ϕ(z) =Z ∞

ϕ(q)eiqz dq,

δ(z) =

(1)

(2)

We find ϕ(q) = −2ip · k/[s(k2 + q2)] and from Eq. (1)
ϕ(z) = −2πip · ke−kz/(sk), and then obtain for the
macroscopic field its components in the directions parallel
and perpendicular to the ML:

Ez(ρ, z) = −ez

p · k sgn(z)e−kzeik·ρ.

(3a)

(3b)

Here sgn(z) is the sign function and in particular the
z-component of the field is zero in the ML.

Recall that in bulk polar crystals the macroscopic
field is strongly nonanalytical close to zero wavevector,
i.e., its limiting value depending on the direction along
which zero wavevector is approached [13], and the LO
vibrations have a finite field at small wavevectors. Dis-
tinct from the field in 3D crystals, the macroscopic field
[Eqs. (3a) and (3b)] of 2D hBN vanishes at a very small
wavevector for in-plane motion [22], independent of the
direction of the wavevector.

i + 3p · ρiρi/ρ5

In a 2D dipole lattice a dipole p on the ion at a lattice
point ρi = (xi, yi) gives rise to a field at the origin equal
to −p/ρ3
i . The Lorentz local field El, also
called the exciting field [13], is the electric field acting
on an ion due to all the other dipoles oscillating in the
lattice, and can be written as the macroscopic field E
plus another field Ein (namely, the inner field) [13], El =
E+Ein. In a long wavelength lattice wave, the local fields
at the B and N lattice points are given by the following
expressions [31], respectively,

El,1 = E + Q0 p1 + Q1 p2,

(4a)

El,2 = E + Q1 p1 + Q0 p2.

(4b)

E2 = E + Q1 p1 + Q0 p2 − ea(Q1 − Q0)u2,

(5b)
Let dipole p1 or equally p2 have 0.01 eA, for instance,
corresponding to a displacement of 0.01 A of the ions
with charge e, then from these expressions one finds very
strong local fields with a magnitude 1000 kV/cm [31].

The LFEs are included through coefficients Q0 and
Q1. Note that E is the macroscopic field [Eqs. (3a) and
(3b)] rather than an external field in a simple sense [31].
Such a simple relation between the local field and the
macroscopic field is valid only for the long lattice waves,
while the general expression for an arbitrary wavelength
is quite complicated with both coefficients Q0 and Q1 de-
pendent on the wavevector. In 3D iostropic polar crys-
tals [13] the difference between the local and macroscopic
fields is proportional to the macroscopic polarization di-
rectly (the Lorentz relation), El = E + 4πP/3, as the Q
coefficients are equal to 4π/(3va) at k = 0 [13]. When
approximating Q0 = Q1, Eqs. (4a) and (4b) can be trans-
formed into a simple Lorentz relation involving macro-
scopic areal polarization (p1 + p2)/s, and also a Clausius-
Mossotti relation can be deduced for 2D BN (Appendix
A). Expressions (4a) and (4b), the Lorentz relations for
2D BN, show that the finite local fields occur in ML hBN
at k = 0, different from those in the 3D polar crystals
where local fields vanish in the long wavelength limit [13].
Apart from the macroscopic field and local fields, we
also need to find the field change at the center of an ion
of type κ owing to its own displacement uκ [13]. The
field is evidently equal to the field created at the ion κ
site by displacing all other ions by −uκ. Hence it is equal
to the local field at that ion site in a dipole lattice with
displacement dipoles pκ′ = −eκ′uκ, where type κ′ = 1, 2.
Substituting this dipole expression into Eqs. (4a) and
(4b) and putting E = 0 as wavevector k = 0, we find the
field changes at the centers of the B and N ions due to
their own displacements respectively,

Eu,1 = −u1(e1Q0 + e2Q1),

Eu,2 = −u2(e1Q1 + e2Q0).

(6a)

(6b)

The total Coulomb fields E1 and E2 at the centers of
the B and N ions are simply the sums of El,1 and Eu,1
[Eqs. (4a) and (6a)], and El,2 and Eu,2 [Eqs. (4b) and
(6b)], respectively,

E1 = E + Q0 p1 + Q1 p2 + ea(Q1 − Q0)u1,

(7a)

where all the vectors are in the layer plane.

Assuming that the electronic polarization of an ion
is equivalent to a point-dipole [13], the electronic (i.e.,
induced) dipole moment of the ion κ is then given by
µκ = ακEκ, where ακ is the in-plane electronic polariz-
ability of the ion κ. Then the total dipole moments on
the B and N ions are

p1 = eau1 + α1 E1,

p2 = −eau2 + α2 E2.

(8a)

(8b)

Inserting the expressions for the total fields E1 and E2
into Eqs. (8a) and (8b) and then rearranging the terms,
we find

(1− α1Q0)p1 − α1Q1p2 = ea[1 + α1(Q1 − Q0)]u1 + α1 E,
(9a)

−α2Q1p1+(1−α2Q0)p2 = −ea[1+α2(Q1−Q0)]u2+α2 E.
(9b)
Solving Eqs. (9a) and (9b) then we can express p1 and

p2 in terms of u1, u2 and E as follows:

1

p1 =

p2 =

1

Dnea(1 − α2Q0)(cid:2)1 + α1(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3)u1

Dneaα2Q1(cid:2)1 + α1(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3)u1
− ea(1 − α1Q0)(cid:2)1 + α2(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3)u2
+ α2(cid:2)1 + α1(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3)Eo,
D = 1 − (α1 + α2)Q0 − α1α2(Q2

and introduce the optical displacement w

(10a)

(10b)

(11)

(12)

(13)

where ¯m is the reduced mass, ¯m = m1m2/(m1 + m2).

When expressions (10a) and (10b) are substituted for

p1 and p2, we obtain

P = a21w + a22E,

(14)

where

a21 =

ea

D√ ¯ms(cid:2)1+α1(Q1−Q0)(cid:3)(cid:2)1+α2(Q1−Q0)(cid:3), (15a)

1

a22 =

sD(cid:2)(α1 + α2) + 2α1α2(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3).

(15b)

Eq. (14) shows that the macroscopic quantity P of the
2D crystal, which has a clear physical meaning as given
by expressions (12), is simplified to a sum of two con-
tributions, one due to the optical displacement and the
other due to the macroscopic field.

It is evident from Eq. (14) that a22 is the in-plane
component χe of the electronic susceptibility of the 2D
crystal,

a22 = χe.

(16)

When the Born charge [34]

ea

eB =

D(cid:2)1 + α1(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3)(cid:2)1 + α2(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3),

is introduced, then the coefficient a21 relates simply to
the Born charge eB by

5

this virtual energy with respect to virtual displacement
u, given by ∇u(µκ· El,κ). Inserting the above dipole mo-
ment expression into Eqs. (4a) and (4b) and recalling the
macroscopic field E = 0, we find the local fields and then
obtain for the forces on the dipoles µ1 and µ2 the expres-
sions ea(Q1 − Q0)µ1 and −ea(Q1 − Q0)µ2, respectively,
where µκ = ακEκ (κ = 1, 2).
Apart from the electric forces, there are also restor-
ing forces caused by the overlap potential between the
positive and negative ions in the 2D polar crystal. The
restoring forces on the B and N ions are −K(u1 − u2),
and −K(u2 − u1), respectively, where the spring force
constant K for in-plane motion is a simple scalar rather
than a tensor due to the hexagonal symmetry.

Therefore the equations of motion for the B and N ions

(17)

are given by

m1 u1 = −K(u1− u2) + eaE1 + eaα1(Q1− Q0)E1, (21a)

a21 =

eB√ ¯ms

.

From Eqs. (15b), (16) and (17) we find

a22 = χe =

1

sQ1 (cid:18) eB

ea − 1(cid:19) ,

m2 u2 = −K(u2− u1)− eaE2− eaα2(Q1− Q0)E2. (21b)
Substitute expressions (20a) and (20b) for E1 and E2 re-
spectively in the two equations above. Using the Born
charge eB [expression (17)] and introducing a force con-
stant due to LFEs Ke,

(18)

(19)

Ke = eaeBQ1,

(22)

showing that apart from a21, the coefficient a22 is also
related to the Born charge. eB 6= ea owing to the elec-
tronic polarization of the ions, and further considering
Q1 > 0, eB is greater than ea.

Inserting expressions (10a) and (10b) for p1 and p2
into Eqs. (7a) and (7b), we express the total fields E1 and
E2 in terms of the ionic displacements and macroscopic
field. After collecting like terms we can simplify the total
field expressions to

1

E1 =

E2 =

D(cid:2)1 + α2(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3)(cid:2)eaQ1(u1 − u2) + E(cid:3), (20a)
D(cid:2)1 + α1(Q1 − Q0)(cid:3)(cid:2)eaQ1(u1 − u2) + E(cid:3). (20b)

The Coulomb force acting on the ion κ consists of two
parts [13], (i) the force exerted on the ionic charge eκ by
the total field Eκ, and (ii) the force exerted on the in-
duced dipole µκ by the field of all other ions. The latter
electric force can be sought by using again the Lorentz
relations (4a) and (4b) as follows. Imagine that we sub-
ject the dipole µκ at a particular site of ion κ a virtual
displacement u while keeping all other ions in their undis-
placed positions. The virtual energy is then simply the
interaction energy between the dipole and the field at the
ion site which is created equivalently by displacing all
other ions by −u [13], and which is thus the local field in
a dipole lattice with dipole moments pκ′ = −eκ′u, (type
κ′ = 1, 2). Therefore the virtual energy is −µκ · El,κ,
and the force on the dipole is the negative gradient of

the equations of motion reduce to

m1 u1 = (Ke − K)(u1 − u2) + eBE,

m2 u2 = (K − Ke)(u1 − u2) − eBE.

(23a)

(23b)

Multiplying Eqs. (23a) and (23b) by m2 and m1 re-
spectively, subtracting and then dividing by (m1 + m2),
we find

¯m(u1 − u2) = (Ke − K)(u1 − u2) + eBE.

(24)

On expressing (u1 − u2) in terms of w [Eq. (13)], we

obtain

w = a11w + a12E,

(25)

where

a11 =

¯m

(Ke − K) = −ω2

a12 =

(26b)

ω0 being the intrinsic oscillator frequency, i.e., in the ab-
sence of macroscopic field E.

Comparing Eqs. (18) and (26b) we find the relation

a12 = a21.

(27)

The equation of motion (25) and the polarization equa-
tion (14) describe the in-plane polar optical vibrations of
2D BN, the frequencies of which will be derived in Sec.
III below. The lattice vibrations we are dealing with
are of long wavelengths, and the pair of equations (25)
and (14) constitute a macroscopic description of the lat-
tice motion. It is shown in Appendix B that, from the
viewpoint of the macroscopic theory, the relation (27) is
due to the principle of energy conservation, and further
this relation makes it possible to define an areal energy
density [expression (B16)] from which the lattice equa-
tions (25) and (14) can be rederived. It is evident from
Eqs. (23a) and (23b) that the center of mass of the two
atoms remains stationary (frequency ω = 0), yielding
trivial nondynamical solutions. We note that for clear-
ness E appearing in all the equations above is used to
represent the in-plane component of the macroscopic field
in the ML, i.e., E = Eρ(ρ, 0).

Now we consider ionic motion perpendicular to the
in which case the displacements uκ and
layer plane,
dipole moments pκ are parallel to ez. Let α′κ denote
the electronic polarizability of the type κ ions; note that
in general α′κ 6= ακ (the latter is the polarizability for
in-plane motion), as they are simply components of the
polarizability tensor [13]. Let K′ be the force constant
associated with the perpendicular motion. Considering
the anisotropic 3D charge density distribution, another
static effective charge e′a exists likewise, which may differ
from ea for in-plane motion (anisotropy), and is needed
in the point-ion model for the perpendicular motion; thus
the charges on the ions are e′1 = −e′2 = e′a.

Solving the Poisson equation yields the electrostatic

ϕ(z) = 2πp · ez sgn(z)e−kz/s,

(28)

and then the z- and in-plane components of the macro-
scopic field follow,

(29b)

We note that (i) there is a δ(z) term in the z-component
of the macroscopic field, which reflects the microscopic
character of the polarization in terms of its atomic scale
when the dipoles point to the z direction. This term
follows the dielectric polarization P according to −4πP,
which is also true when the δ(z) function of P is gen-
eralized to an arbitrary function f (z); (ii) the in-plane
component of the field is zero in the ML.

The local fields at the B and N sites are given by

El,1 = E + Q′0 p1 + Q′1 p2,

El,2 = E + Q′1 p1 + Q′0 p2,

(30a)

(30b)

6

respectively, where the coefficients Q′0 and Q′1 are nega-
tive, Q′0 = −2Q0, and Q′1 = −2Q1 [31]. The long wave-
length macroscopic field has a δ(z) form [Eq. (29a)] but
in calculating the field change experienced by a type κ
ion owing to its own displacement uκ, the contribution of

this macroscopic field is zero, i.e., 4πuκPκ′ e′κ′δ(z)/s =

4πuκ(e′1 + e′2)δ(z)/s = 0. Thus the field changes at the
centers of B and N owing to their own displacements are

Eu,1 = −u1(e′1Q′0 + e′2Q′1),

Eu,2 = −u2(e′1Q′1 + e′2Q′0),

(31a)

(31b)

respectively. Similarly, in calculating the force exerted on
the induced dipole µκ at a type κ ion by the field of all
other ions, the macroscopic field makes no contribution to
this force again because the net charge per cell vanishes.
Then repeating the process as before, we find that with
replacements Q0 → Q′0, Q1 → Q′1, ea → e′a, ακ → α′κ
and K → K′, the equations and expressions above for
the in-plane motion are applicable to the out-of-plane
motion.

The Born charge is

D′(cid:2)1 + α′1(Q′1 − Q′0)(cid:3)(cid:2)1 + α′2(Q′1 − Q′0)(cid:3),

0 ).

The polarization equation is

P = c21w + c22E,

(32)

(33)

(34)

where w is the optical displacement as given by Eq. (13)
and c22 is the out-of-plane component χ′e of the electronic
susceptibility of the 2D crystal,

c22 = χ′e,

and c21 and c22 relate to the Born charge via

In the lattice equations (37) and (34) E is the field in
the ML, E(ρ, 0), and evidently E(ρ, 0) = Ez(ρ, 0) for the
out-of-plane vibrations. The areal energy density associ-
ated with the out-of-plane optical vibrations is given by
expression (B31).

When the equations for in-plane motion [Eqs. (25) and
(14)] and out-of-plane motion [Eqs. (37) and (34)] are
considered simultaneously, they can be rewritten for clar-
ity as

wρ(ρ) = a11wρ(ρ) + a12Eρ(ρ, 0),

(39a)

P ρ(ρ) = a21wρ(ρ) + a22Eρ(ρ, 0),

(39b)

and

wz(ρ) = c11wz(ρ) + c12Ez(ρ, 0),

(40a)

P z(ρ) = c21wz(ρ) + c22Ez(ρ, 0),

(40b)

respectively, where a12 = a21 and c12 = c21. These equa-
tions have similar forms to Huang's equations for bulk
crystals [13, 15].

B.

In-plane and out-of-plane optical modes

The in-plane optical vibration modes can be obtained
from Eqs. (25) and (14) in conjunction with the equa-
tion of electrostatics ∇ · (E + 4πP) = 0, where P is
the dielectric polarization (namely, a dipole moment per
unit volume), P = Pδ(z), and E is an irrotational
field, E = −∇φ. Let w(ρ) = w0eik·ρ and electro-
static potential φ(ρ, z) = ϕ(z)eik·ρ (time dependence
e−iωt
is omitted for clearness). Expressing the field
E = −∇φ in terms of ϕ gives the in-plane component
Eρ(ρ, z) = −ikϕ(z)eik·ρ and further this field in the ML
Eρ(ρ, 0) = −ikϕ(0)eik·ρ. Then apply divergence ∇ρ to
Eq. (14), and we have the polarization charge density
−∇·P = −δ(z)∇ρ·P = −δ(z)[a21ik·w+a22k2ϕ(0)eik·ρ]
and obtain Poisson's equation,
∇2φ(ρ, z) = 4πδ(z)[a21ik· w(ρ) + a22k2ϕ(0)eik·ρ]. (41)
To solve Eq. (41), we insert the expansions of ϕ(z)

[Eq. (1)] and δ(z) [Eq. (2)], yielding

ϕ(q) = −2(cid:2)a21ik · w0 + a22k2ϕ(0)(cid:3)

(45)

For a normal mode with wavevector k, Eq. (25) be-

comes

(−ω2 − a11)w(ρ) = a12Eρ(ρ, 0).

(46)

The expression (45) admits two possibilities for w · k,
namely, case (i) w · k = 0, or case (ii) w · k 6= 0. In case
(i), as w · k = 0 the normal modes are transverse waves.
Eq. (44) gives ϕ(0) = 0, and on account of Eq. (42) we
have ϕ(q) = 0. Then it follows from Eq. (1) that ϕ(z) =
0, and therefore in the electrostatic approximation the
macroscopic field vanishes identically, E(r) = 0. The
frequency of the TO mode of wavevector k is given by
the solution of Eq. (46) with the field equal to zero,

ωt = ω0 = √−a11 =r K − eaeBQ1

¯m

,

(47)

which is independent of wavevector; that is, the long-
wavelength TO modes are dispersionless, consistent with
previous tight-binding [22] and first-principles [24, 25, 35]
calculations.

In case (ii) the electric field Eρ(r) is nonzero, and from
the equations evidently the vectors w(ρ), Eρ(r), P(r) as-
sociated with the mode are all longitudinal, i.e., parallel
Inserting
to wave vector k, w(ρ) k Eρ(r) k P(r) k k.
expression (45) for Eρ(ρ, 0) into Eq. (46) we find the
frequency of the longitudinal optical (LO) mode,

ωl(k) =(cid:16) − a11 +

(48)

Expressing the a-coefficients in terms of eB, χe, ω0 by

ωl(k) =hω2

and has an upper limit ωM for very large k,

ωM =qω2

(50)

l = ω2

In the theoretical study by Sohier et al.

[25] the LO
phonon dispersion is expressed as ω2
0 + Sk/(1 +
ref f k). From their Eqs. (2) and (3)[36] one finds that
the parameter S relates to the Born charge via S =
2πe2
B/( ¯ms). ref f is an effective screening length, given by
by ref f = ǫpt/2 with an effective medium model [25, 37],
where ǫp and t are effective dielectric constant and ef-
fective thickness of the ML material. Both parameters
S and ref f are computed by first-principles calculation
[25]. According to the defintion in Refs.[38, 39], the ef-
fective screening length is given by 2πχe or 2πχ0 when

including the vibrational contribution [χ0 is the static
susceptibility Eq. (74)]. As it is the high-frequency di-
electric constant that determines the difference between
the squared LO and TO phonon frequencies [29, 30, 34]
so ref f takes the former, i.e., ref f = 2πχe. Therefore
the LO phonon dispersion Eq. (49) is identical to the
analytical expression of Sohier et al..

Having ϕ(0) [Eq. (44)] for the LO mode ωl(k), we sub-
stitute expression (42) back into Eq. (1) to give the elec-
tric potential and then obtain the macroscopic field as-
sociated with the LO mode, expressed in terms of mode
displacement w [in a form consistent with Eqs. (3a) and
(3b)],

(51b)
The long-range electrostatic interactions cause a higher
LO frequency than the TO frequency for a finite k [22]
with the splitting determined by the latter term in the
square brackets of Eq. (49). This term also shows that
there is no splitting in the limit k → 0 as the macro-
scopic field vanishes [Eq. (51a)], which is different from
the situation in bulk BN where LO-TO splitting occurs
also at the Γ point [24, 40]. Therefore, the transpar-
ent expressions (47) and (49) show the degeneracy of the
LO and TO modes at Γ and their splitting at a finite
wavevector, well-known phenomena of the 2D semicon-
ductors [22, 24 -- 26, 35].

The out-of-plane optical vibrations, namely, the ZO
modes, can be obtained from Eqs. (37) and (34) with
the electrostatic approach as follows. Recall that the
z-component of the field [Eq. (29a)] has a δ(z) term, di-
vergent at z = 0, because the ML is treated as a ge-
ometric plane where the ionic charge distribution and
polarization density P have a δ(z) form. We approxi-
mate δ(z) by a Gaussian distribution with a small thick-
ness ε (ε → 0 ), δε(z) = 1√πε e−z2/ε2
, as in the theo-
retical study [26]. A similar treatment is used also in
first-principles calculations [25]. The z-component of the
field in the ML is Ez(ρ, 0) = −ezϕ′(0)eik·ρ, and after
inserting this field into Eq. (34) the polarization charge
density can be expressed as −∇ · P = −δ′ε(z)ez · P =
−[c21w · ez − c22ϕ′(0)eik·ρ]δ′ε(z). Thus Poisson's equa-
tion is given by
∇2φ(ρ, z) = 4πδ′ε(z)[c21w(ρ) · ez − c22ϕ′(0)eik·ρ]. (52)
Expanding ϕ(z) [Eq. (1)] and δε(z)

then we have

(63)

The ionic polarization (i.e., χ′e 6= 0) ensures a finite fre-
quency; otherwise ωz [Eq. (62)] becomes extremely large
and even ωz → ∞ [Eq. (63)] when χ′e is neglected in the
RIM (also see Table IV). The result here that the long

wavelength ZO modes are dispersionless agrees with pre-
vious calculations which show a very flat dispersion curve
at small wavevectors [22, 24, 26, 35].

Having ϕ′(0) [Eq. (58)] for a ZO mode we then get
ϕ′(z) from Eq. (57) and also obtain ϕ(z) after substi-
tuting the ϕ(q) expression (56) into Eq. (1). It follows
that the macroscopic field associated with the ZO mode

In particular we note that the in-plane component is an
odd function of z, and negligible at very small k and ε.

C. Phonon group velocity and density of states

tor k, the LO phonon frequency near the Γ point is given
by

where ωM is the upper bound of LO phonon frequency
[expression (50)].

phonon frequency near Γ,

ε + 4√πχ′e(cid:17)2

.

(70)

Dropping the terms due to the EP of ions, expansions
(66) and (69) then reduce to a form as given by the RIM
of Ref.[26] [Eqs. (57) and (59) therein]. The nearly flat
dispersion of the ZO modes allows their DOS to be ap-
proximated by [26]

gz(ω) =

ωz − ω
2πc2
z

, ω < ωz.

(71)

Evidently cz is close to zero as ε ≪ 4√πχ′e for the 2D
crystal, resulting in the ZO modes being nondispersive.
The group velocity is ∇kωi(k) = ω′i(k)k/k, where i
indexes a phonon branch of LO, TO or ZO modes so
the cl and cz above are simply the norms of the group
velocities of the LO and ZO modes at Γ, respectively,
corresponding to the slopes [25] of the phonon dispersion
curves. For the long lattice waves, as the wavevector k
increases, clearly ωl increases and ωz decreases, whereas
ωt stays flat near Γ [Eq. (47)].

D.

2D lattice dielectric susceptibility and dielectric

function

The lattice susceptibility of ML hBN for in-plane po-
larization can be deduced from Eqs. (25) and (14) by
considering periodic solutions, W, E, P ∝ e−iωt, due
to an external charge or electromagnetic field with os-
cillation frequency ω. Then Eq. (25) reduces simply to
Eq. (46).
Inserting Eq. (46) into Eq. (14) to eliminate
W, one finds

P(ρ) = [a22 −

a12a21
ω2 + a11

(72)

and subsequently the 2D dielectric susceptibility, defined
by χ = P(ρ)/Eρ(ρ, 0),

which is identical to that given in Ref.[26].

tronic) susceptibility.

The static dielectric susceptibility χ0 follows from ex-

pression (73),

χ0 = χe +

e2
B

¯msω2

,

(74)

where the second term on the right-hand side is the vi-
brational (also called ionic) contribution. With Eq. (74),
a12 [Eq. (26b)] can be expressed in terms of the 2D sus-
ceptibilities,

a12 = a21 = ω0√χ0 − χe.

(75)

The 2D dynamical susceptibility χ(ω) can be ex-
pressed in terms of three quantities that are usually used,
namely, the intrinsic oscillator frequency ω0 and the high-
frequency and static susceptibilities χe, χ0,

χ(ω) = χe +

χ0 − χe
1 − ω2/ω2

,

(76)

which has a similar form to its counterpart of bulk polar
crystals [13].

Similarly, the 2D dielectric susceptibility for the ver-
tical z-polarization χ′ (the prime does not indicate a
derivative), defined by χ′ = P(ρ)/Ez(ρ, 0) for any par-
ticular ω, is deduced from Eqs. (37) and (34),

χ′(ω) = c22 −

(77)

(78)

Combining Eqs. (78) and (38b), one can express c12 in

terms of the 2D susceptibilities,

c12 = c21 = ω′0pχ′0 − χ′e.

(79)

The 2D dynamical susceptibility χ′(ω) can also be ex-

pressed in terms of three quantities χ′e, χ′0, ω′0,

χ′(ω) = χ′e +

χ′0 − χ′e
1 − ω2/ω′2

Eq. (78) we find a simple relation

(81)

The 2D high-frequency and static dielectric susceptibil-
ities can be calculated from first principles, and knowing
their values the susceptibility expressions (74) and (78)
obtained here will be used below in Sec. III to determine
the model parameters such as the effective charges and
spring force constants, and the a- or c-coefficients of the
lattice equations [Eqs. (39a), (39b), (40a) and (40b)].

The lattice dielectric function (DF) can be obtained by
considering the response of the 2D lattice to a test charge
in the electrostatic approximation. Now the equation of
electrostatics is given by ∇· (E + 4πP) = 4πσ, where σ is
the test charge density function dependent on r, t, and E
is the total field of the test charge plus the polarization

10

charge. To find the dielectric response let σ have the form
σ = σ0eik·ρf (z), where f (z) is an arbitrary function to
describe the charge distribution in the z direction, for the
general case that the external charge is not necessarily
confined in the ML, and time dependence e−iωt has been
absorbed into σ0 for clearness.

First, let us consider a charge distribution that is asym-
metric with respect to the ML, i.e., f (−z) 6= f (z), for in-
stance, when the test charge is simply put above or below
the ML. Then the field due to the charge is nonzero in the
ML, Eρ(ρ, 0) 6= 0, Ez(ρ, 0) 6= 0, and therefore the lattice
responds creating both in-plane [Eqs. (39a) and (39b)]
and out-of-plane [Eqs. (40a) and (40b)] vibrations, with
all quantities such as wρ, wz, P ρ, P z, E varying ac-
cording to ei(k·ρ−ωt). Now the dielectric polarization is
given by the sum of the in-plane and out-of-plane contri-
butions, P = (P ρ + P z)δ(z), where P ρ = χ(ω)Eρ(ρ, 0)
and P z = χ′(ω)Ez(ρ, 0), with χ and χ′ being the 2D
susceptibilities [Eqs. (73) and (77)]. Writing E = −∇φ
with the total electrostatic potential φ(ρ, z) = ϕ(z)eik·ρ,
one expresses the polarization charge density −∇ · P in
terms of the derivatives of potential φ, and then Poisson's
equation follows from the equation of electrostatics,

∇2φ(ρ, z) = −4π(cid:2)σ0eik·ρf (z) + χ(ω)δ(z)∇2

+χ′(ω)ϕ′(0)eik·ρδ′(z)(cid:3) ,

where φ(ρ, 0) is the total potential in the ML, φ(ρ, 0) =
ϕ(0)eik·ρ. Inserting the expansion of f (z),

(84)
where the three terms on the right-hand side represent
the respective contributions due to the external charge,
in-plane and out-of-plane lattice polarization. Here ϕ(q)
is expressed in terms of ϕ(0) and ϕ′(0) as they are
proportional to the field components in the ML, i.e.,
ϕ(0) ∝ Eρ(ρ, 0) and ϕ′(0) ∝ Ez(ρ, 0). Integrating ϕ(q)
over q according to Eq. (43), one then obtains ϕ(0),

The out-of-plane (ZO) motion makes no contribution
to ϕ(0) as the integration value of the third term of ϕ(q)
is zero. Clearly ϕσ(0)eik·ρ is the electrostatic potential
in the ML due to the test charge alone, and therefore the

dielectric function of the 2D lattice, which is defined as
the ratio of this test charge potential to the total poten-
tial in the ML ϕ(0)eik·ρ (extension of the 2D wavevector-
dependent dielectric function ǫ(k) of Ref.[38]), is given
by

showing a linear dependence on wavevector as the ǫ(k)

In expression (84) for ϕ(q), ϕ(0) is known [Eq. (85)],
and ϕ′(0) can be determined through expression (54) for
ϕ′(z) as follows. Substituting expression (84) for ϕ(q) in

The square bracketed part is a familiar form that has
appeared in Eq. (29a). To find ϕ′(0) we introduce an ef-
fective thickness ε to δ(z) to approach it with δε(z) as was
done above in Sec. III. Let Λ = δε(0); Λ = 1/(√πε), for
instance, when δ(z) is approximated by a Gaussian [26],
/(√πε). Now taking z = 0 in Eq. (88),
δε(z) = e−z2/ε2
the term containing χ(ω)ϕ(0) vanishes, i.e., the in-plane

Recalling Eρ(ρ, z) = −ikφ(r) with Eq.

(90a)
for Eρ(ρ, z), evidently the induced potential asso-
ciated with the ZO polarization is proportional to
χ′(ω)ϕ′(0) sgn(z)e−kz, which is zero in the ML plane

11

and antisymmetric with respect to it, consistent with
Eq. (28) above. The in-plane component of the field
associated with the ZO motion [the term containing
χ′(ω)ϕ′(0) in Eq. (90a)] is zero in the ML and thus the
ZO motion does not influence the LO motion; mean-
while the LO motion has zero z-component of its field
[the χ(ω)ϕ(0) term in Eq. (90b)] in the ML and thus
no influence on the ZO motion, making the LO and ZO
vibrations driven by the exernal charge essentially inde-
pendent of each other. For small thickness ε, ϕ′(0) is
small from Eq. (89) and there is only a small ZO compo-
nent, which becomes negligible in the limit ε → 0, in the
driven lattice motion [refer to Eq. (82)]. For a symmetric
test charge distribution f (−z) = f (z), Ez(ρ, 0) = 0, and
this causes only in-plane vibration, with displacement w
and polarization P both parallel to the ML plane, and ev-
idently yields the same DF ǫ(k, ω) as given by expression
(87) above.

As the polarization charge density associated with
the in-plane motion is −δ(z)∇ρ · P ρ(ρ) = −δ(z)[a21 −
a22(ω2 + a11)/a12]ik · wρ 6= 0, and wρ k P ρ k Eρ(ρ, 0) k
k, the DF ǫ(k, ω) is due only to the LO vibrations and
thus is a longitudinal DF. In the absence of a test charge
(σ = 0), there is still a finite electric field Eρ(ρ, 0) and
potential φ(ρ, 0) due to the LO vibrations, and there-
fore it follows from Eq. (85) that the LO modes are the
solutions to

ǫ(k, ω) = 0.

(91)

From Eqs. (87) and (91) one indeed obtains the LO
phonon dispersion ωl(k) of expression (49).
In bulk
crystals the lattice DF is zero at the bulk LO mode
frequency [13]. From expression (87) the static DF is
ǫ0(k) = 1 + 2πχ0k, while at high frequencies ω ≫ ω0
the vibrational contribution is negligible yielding the DF
ǫ∞(k) = 1 + 2πχek, with 2πχ0 and 2πχe being the ef-
fective screening lengths [38, 39]. Both static and high-
frequency DFs have the same form as that deduced by
Cudazzo et al. [38].

In terms of the three key quantities ωt, ωl(k), ǫ∞(k)
the lattice DF of the 2D crystal can be expressed in the
form

ǫ(k, ω) = ǫ∞(k)

ω2 − ω2
l (k)
ω2 − ω2

t

,

(92)

which is similar to the lattice DF of bulk polar crystals
[13], the difference being that here both the LO phonon
frequency and DF are dependent on wavevector. In bulk
crystals there is the LST relation [17], ω2
t = ǫ0/ǫ∞;
for the 2D crystal a similar relation can be deduced from
expression (92),

l /ω2

(93)

with the three quantities dependent on wavevector.

The extended LST relation (93) connects the phonon
frequencies to the two DFs; given the former, then the ra-
tio of the latter is known, and vice versa. Furthermore,

since the difference between the LO and TO frequen-
cies is due entirely to the macroscopic field, the relation
can be used to measure the phonon frequency change
caused by the field. Similarly, for out-of-plane motion
the susceptibilities χ′0 and χ′e are related to phonon fre-
quencies ωz and ω′0 via the frequency -- susceptibility rela-
tion (81), which conveniently quantifies the effect of the
macroscopic field on the ZO phonon frequency.

III. LATTICE DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES:

LOCAL FIELD AND POLARIZABLE ION

EFFECTS

A.

In-plane optical modes

The 2D clamped-ion susceptibility χe, a key quan-
tity entering the derived expressions for in-plane motion,
can be obtained from first-principles calculation in four
ways as follows. The 2D DF ǫ(q) was calculated within
the random-phase approximation by a first-principles su-
percell approach for a number of 2D crystals such as
h-BN [2], phosphorene and TMDs [2, 39, 41].
In the
first method, from the calculated DF the χe values of
2D TMDs were extracted in Ref.[39] by employing the
relation ǫ(L) = 1 + 4πχe/L [38], where L is the inter-
layer separation for a supercell containing two MLs of
TMD, and ǫ(L) is the in-plane dielectric constant due
to electronic polarization. For 2D MoS2, the obtained
χe=6.6 A [39] is nearly equal to the susceptibility 6.5 A
extracted from bulk MoS2 simply by taking L = c/2 (c
is the lattice constant of bulk MoS2) whilst making ǫ(L)
equal to the in-plane dielectric constant of bulk MoS2.
When the experimental lattice constant c=6.66 A [42]
and in-plane high-frequency dielectric constant ǫ = 4.95
(Ref.[43]) of bulk h-BN are put into the above relation,
the susceptibility of 2D BN is estimated to be χe=1.0 A.
The 2D susceptibility χe can also be obtained by employ-
ing ǫ(q) = 1 + 2πχeq [38] as the slope of the ǫ(q) curve
[2, 41] in the small-wavevector q region equals the screen-
ing length ref f = 2πχe. From Fig. 1 of Ref.[2] one finds
a susceptibility χe=5.9 A for 2D MoS2 and χe=0.8 A
for 2D hBN. The 2D susceptibility can also be calculated
when knowing the screening length ref f . For 2D hBN
the calculated screening length is 7.64 A [25], thus corre-
sponding to a susceptibility χe of 1.216 A. In the fourth
method, the (clamped ion) electronic energy in the unit
cell is calculated for crystals in an external electric field
[21, 44], and then the first derivative of the electronic en-
ergy with respect to the field yields the induced dipole
moment per cell, namely, the induced macroscopic po-
larization corresponding, for 2D hBN, to the last term in
Eqs. (14) and (34), and the second derivative of the en-
ergy with respect to the field yields the electronic polar-
izability per cell. For ML hBN an electronic polarizabil-
ity 4.591 A3 per cell (Table IV of Ref.[21]) was obtained
from a coupled perturbed Kohn-Sham (CPKS) calcula-
tion with the ab initio CRYSTAL09 code. Dividing this

12

value by the area of the unit cell s we find a 2D suscepti-
bility χe=0.848 A which is very close to the value 0.8 A
of the second method. Similarly, using the static polariz-
ability 7.111 A3 per cell given in the same reference [21]
we find a static dielectric susceptibility (i.e., including
the lattice contribution) χ0=1.314 A. Unless otherwise
stated, these 2D susceptibilities χe and χ0 from Ref.[21]
are used in this study.

Through the three expressions (19), (47) and (74) we
obtained, the three quantities of the 2D crystal, namely,
the two macroscopic susceptibilities χe, χ0 and the col-
lective vibration frequency ω0 are related to the three
microscopic quantities, ea, eB, K. Therefore, the values
of the three microscopic quantities can be determined by
using a set of three values χe, χ0, ω0 calculated from
first principles. Further, all the three mutually indepen-
dent a-coefficients a11, a21 (or a12), a22 in the equation
of motion (25) and polarization equation (14) can also
be determined through Eqs. (16), (26a) and (75). Of the
four microscopic quantities α1, α2, ea, K on which the a-
coefficients originally depend [refer to Eqs. (15a), (15b),
(26a), (22) and (17)], the polarizabilities of the con-
stituent atoms of ML hBN α1, α2 are unknown. There-
fore, the adoption of the three known quantities χe, χ0,
ω0 facilitates the use of the deduced equations for in-
plane motion by circumventing the two unknowns α1 and
α2. We note that, although the values of α1, α2 are un-
known, their sum α1 + α2, the atomic poarizability of
the unit cell, is found to fall in an interval, expressed in
terms of χe in inequality (A10), which is obtained with
a generalized Clausius-Mossotti relation connecting the
microscopic polarizabilities α1, α2 and the macroscopic
dielectric susceptibility χe (refer to Appendix A). Taking
χe = 0.85 A [21] yields 1.3084 A3 ≤ α1 + α2 ≤ 1.7530 A3,
which are smaller than the total free-atom polarizability
4.0 A3 (Appendix A). This interval will be used below to
evaluate the LFEs on the LO phonon frequency and 2D
dielectric susceptibilities (Table II below).

Using the susceptibilities χe = 0.848 A and χ0 =
1.314 A from CPKS calculation (Ref.[21]) and the
phonon frequency ω0=1371 cm−1 calculated from first
principles by the same group (Ref.[45]), we calculated the
three microscopic quantities ea, eB, K from Eqs. (19),
(47) and (74). We also calculated the force constant due
to LFEs Ke [Eq. (22)] and the LO phonon group veloc-
ity cl [Eq. (67)] and present the result in Table I (upper
row). In the theoretical study by Sohier et al.
[25] the
S parameter, related to eB by S = 2πe2
B/( ¯ms), is calcu-
lated by density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT).
For 2D hBN the value S = 8.4 × 10−2 eV2·A [25] so we
find eB = 2.71e. In that study, the calculated frequency
ω0 is 1387.2 cm−1 (Table 1 of Ref.[25]), and recall that
a susceptibility χe=1.216 A has been already calculated
above through ref f =7.64 A [25]. Now having these three
values of χe, eB, ω0, again by using Eqs. (19), (47) and
(74) we calculated the quantities Ke, cl as well as χ0, ea,
K, which are also listed in Table I (lower row) for com-
parison. First, we see two nearly equal values of Born

charge, 2.70e and 2.71e, the latter being also equal to an-
other recent DFPT calculation [6] as well as the eB value
of the bulk hBN [40]. According to Eq. (19), eB is greater
than ea as χe > 0 due to EP of ions, and the numerical
result shows that eB is four times larger than ea. Also
the two effective charge ea values are close to previous
first-principles results 0.56e [46] and 0.43e [24] obtained
respectively with Bader's method and Lowdin's analysis
on charge transfer. Second, both susceptibilities χe and
χ0 are larger in the lower row but the vibrational con-
tributions to the static susceptibility namely the χ0 − χe
values are nearly equal in the two cases, which are 0.46
and 0.45 A for the upper and lower rows, respectively.
Third, the group velocity cl corresponds to the slope of
the LO phonon dispersion curve at Γ; the two values of
cl are very close with a difference of only 0.38% (Table I)
but they are one order of magnitude larger than the value
1.94 km/s calculated without taking into account EP of
ions [26]. Fourth, in Ref.[26] the force constant parame-
ters are generated by making a percentage reduction of
those of graphene, and from their table I we work out a
spring force constant K=41.86 eV/A2 (K′=14.48 eV/A2
for out-of-plane motion), which is 26% and 30% smaller
than the force constant K values 56.5 and 59.8 eV/A2
of the present Table I. Fifth, the intrinsic oscillator fre-
quency ω0 is determined by K − Ke [Eq. (26a)] rather
than by K alone, i.e., ω2
0 = (K − Ke)/ ¯m; then the ra-
tio Ke/K expresses the percentage reduction due to the
LFEs, which from Table I is Ke/K=24% and 29%. Sixth,
the two quantities cl/ω0 and 4πχe form a factor of the
k2 term in the expansion of ωl(k) [Eq. (66)], and from
Table I the ration is cl
/4πχe=13.5% and 9.3%, indi-
ω0
cating the EP of ions makes the dominant contribution.
Further, this result, together with the third point above,
shows that neglecting ionic polarization such as RIM [26]
cannot properly describe the LO phonon dispersion. Be-
low we shall use the first row of parameters to evaluate
the influence of EP and LFEs on the lattice vibrations
(as is presented in Table II).

In Sec. II the electronic polarization of all the ions is
included through ακ, and the model is referred to as PIM
hereafter, in particular when comparing to the results cal-
culated with the RIM (ακ = 0). In the above calculations
for Table I, therefore both the EP and LFEs have been
taken into account. We now look at what happens when
EP or LFEs are not included. To do this, we compare
various lattice-dynamical quantities such as χe, χ0, eB,
ωt, ωl(k), cl obtained with the RIM and PIM when the
LFEs are neglected or taken into account, the expressions
of which are listed in Table II, for the four approaches
in total. Given χe, χ0, ω0, their expressions (19), (47)
and (74), as noted in Table II, are used to calculate the
microscopic quantities such as ea, eB, K, α1 + α2 (see
Appendix A) needed in these approaches. Just below the
expressions in the table the specific value-substituted LO
phonon dispersion ωl(k) and the values of the other five
quantities are also listed for comparison: for the PIM in-
cluding the LFEs (last row), the susceptibilities χe, χ0

13

and frequency ωt (equal to ω0) are input values taken
from first-principles calculations [21, 45], while the oth-
ers were calculated using this set of χe, χ0, ω0 values,
as we did in the above calculations for Table I; for the
other three approaches, the quantities are transformed to
depend on ea and/or K as their expressions show, and
are therefore calculated using the ea and K parameters
that are obtained with the same set of χe, χ0, ω0 values
(as was given in the first row of Table I). Several points
can be made by comparing the results obtained with the
four approaches. First, there is no electronic polarization
in the RIM and therefore χe = 0. In the PIM with no
LFEs the electronic susceptibility of ML hBN is simply
χe = (α1 + α2)/s, and taking the interval we obtained
above for α1 + α2 gives 0.2417 A ≤ χe ≤ 0.3239 A, values
that are even smaller than half the 0.85 A obtained when
the LFEs are taken into account. Second, in the RIM -- 
for both cases of excluding and including the LFEs -- and
also in the PIM when neglecting LFEs, the Born charge
reduces simply to the static charge ea = 0.61e, a value
only 23% of the eB that we calculated with the PIM in-
cluding the LFEs. Third, the ions in motion contribute
e2
B/[s(K − eaeBQ1)] to the static susceptibility χ0, and
with the RIM a smaller Born charge of 0.61e causes this
contribution to be only ∼0.018 A, thus underestimat-
ing the vibrational contribution by 96% compared to the
0.46 A which was calculated with the PIM including the
LFEs. Fourth, the LO phonon group velocity cl evalu-
ated with the three simpler approaches, 1.61-1.67 km/s,
is similar to the 1.94 km/s of a RIM result [26] but is one
order of magnitude smaller than the 37.24 km/s given by
the PIM including the LFEs.

Furthermore, the LO phonon dispersion relations given
by the four quantitative expressions of Table II are com-
pared in Fig. 2, where wavevector k is given in units of
Γ− K [25], the distance between the Γ and K points in
the Brillouin zone. For the PIM without LFEs, the pa-
rameter γ is simply taken to be the lower bound 3.8172
as the numerical calculation indicates that the use of
the upper bound 5.1144, for instance, reduces the LO
phonon frequencies by less than 0.08% (not shown), a
change indiscernible to the dispersion curve. When LFEs
are neglected, the two models PIM and RIM yield very
close phonon frequencies that fall in a very narrow range
from 1631 to 1653 cm−1 (upper two lines). The two
curves touch each other at the Γ point with the same
tangent and slope cl=1.61 km/s; the curve obtained by
the RIM displays a linear dispersion relation through
the long-wavelength region k ≤ 0.15Γ − K, while the
PIM curve becomes flatter at larger wavevectors in the
same region of k. When the LFEs are taken into ac-
count, the phonon frequencies are reduced significantly.
For the dispersion calculated with the RIM (middle line),
the dependence of frequency on wavevector remains lin-
ear, with a small slope similar to the case with no LFEs.
For the dispersion curve obtained with the PIM (solid
line), in contrast, owing to the EP of ions, a steep slope
appears on the small wavevector side, corresponding to

an substantially increased phonon group velocity 37.24
km/s, and as the wavevector increases the increase of the
phonon frequency becomes slower (i.e. with a smaller cl),
deviating significantly from its linear dependence near
the Γ point. The LO phonon dispersion of Ref.[25],
ωl = [ω2
0 +Sk/(1 + ref f k)]1/2, with first-principles calcu-
lated values ω0=1387.2 cm−1, S = 8.4 × 10−2 eV2·A,
and ref f =7.64 A,
is also shown (dotted line) and is
very close to the dispersion curve obtained with the our
PIM. According to Eq. (49), the upper limit of ωl at a
sufficiently large k is ωM =1701.6 cm−1; at wavevector
k = 0.15Γ − K, the LO phonon frequency ωl is 1569
cm−1, which is quite close to its limiting value (only
7.8% smaller). For wavevectors k > 0.02Γ− K, as ω in-
creases, the decrease of the group velocity with wavevec-
tor k causes a rapid increase to the LO phonon DOS,
as is clearly seen from Fig. 3 [also refer to the DOS ex-
pression (68)]. Overbending is a prominent feature of
the numerically calculated LO phonon dispersion of ML
hBN [19, 22 -- 24, 26, 35]. For instance, a maximum LO
phonon frequency of 1533 cm−1 (Ref.[35]) or 1570 cm−1
(Ref.[24]) appears at a wavevector ∼0.30Γ − K. Evi-
dently a positive slope cl is essential for the overbending
of the dispersion curve ωl(k). Therefore our result above
indicates that due to the EP of ions, the increase of group
velocity cl has enhanced the overbending substantially.

B. Out-of-plane optical modes

Values of phonon frequency ωz [19, 24, 35, 45], 2D elec-
tronic susceptibility χ′e and static susceptibility χ′0 [21]
associated with out-of-plane motion have been calculated
from first principles. Having these then the intrinsic os-
cillator frequency ω′0 is known through the relation (81).
Given three quantities ω′0, χ′e, χ′0, the three microscopic
quantities namely the static effective charge e′a, the Born
charge e′B and the effective force constant K′ follow from
the three equations (36b), (38a) and (78). Further, all
the three mutually independent c-coefficients c11, c12 (or
c21), c22 in the lattice equations (37) and (34) are also
determined by Eqs. (36b), (38a) and (79).

From Ref.[21] the 2D electronic susceptibility is given
by χ′e = 0.815A3/s = 0.151A. Putting this into Eq. (36b)
gives a negative ratio e′B/e′a = −0.21; that is, the positive
B ions carry a negative Born charge while the negative N
ions move with a positive Born charge. As a result, the
polarization induced by ionic vibrations e′B(u1 − u2)/s is
antiparallel (parallel) to the displacements of the B (N)
ions, and meanwhile the electric force exerted on the B
(N) ions is antiparallel (parallel) to the macroscopic field.
However the negative e′B value has no influence on the
out-of-plane optical (ZO) phonon frequency as e′B enters
the frequency expression via e′2

B [Eq. (63)].

Using the first-principles calculated values χ′e =
0.151 A and χ′0 = 0.164 A (Ref.[21]), we calculated ω′0,
e′a, e′B, K′, K′e for two values of frequency ωz taken from
previous first-principles calculations, 836 cm−1 (first-

14

principles perturbation result of Ref.[45], by the same
group of Ref.[21], and also the direct method result of
Ref.[19]), 800 cm−1 (DFPT value of Refs.[24, 35]), and
for one experimental ωz of 734 cm−1 (Ref.[18]) and also
for a low frequency ωz=405 cm−1 (see Table III). A
larger static effective charge e′a, greater than 1.0e, occurs
for out-of-plane motion than in-plane motion (compare
with in-plane effective charge ea values given in Table I).
Charge transfer is quite complicated in semiconductors
where covalent bonds and ionic bonds coexist [47]. For
2D hBN there is a space allowing a more electron charge
distribution outside the layer plane, probably causing a
larger out-of-plane charge transfer from B to N. In fact,
the calculation shows that a smaller e′a equal to the in-
plane effective charge of 0.61e corresponds to a very low
phonon frequency 405 cm−1 (last row of Table III) that
is unacceptably lower than the first-principles and exper-
imental values. We see a negative Born charge e′B (on B
ions) one order of magnitude smaller than the in-plane
Born charge eB, while the force constant due to LFEs K′e
is one-third the effective spring force constant K′, similar
to the in-plane motion case.

To examine the EP of ions and LFEs on the out-of-
plane motion, we look at the lattice-dynamical proper-
ties χ′e, χ′0, e′B, ω′0, ωz obtained with the RIM and PIM
each including or excluding the LFEs, whose expressions
are listed in Table IV and also whose values obtained
with a set of three first-principles values, χ′e = 0.151
A, χ′0 = 0.164 A, ωz = 836 cm−1 (Refs.[21, 45]), are
given just below the corresponding expressions (the mi-
croscopic quantities e′a, e′B, K′ used in the models were
calculated using the same method as above for Table III).
For the adopted χ′e value 0.151 A the atomic polariz-
ability of the unit cell is found to fall in the interval,
1.9329 A3 ≤ α′1 + α′2 ≤ 2.5792 A3 (Appendix A). In
the PIM without LFEs then the dielectric susceptibil-
ity of ML hBN is given by χ′e = (α′1 + α′2)/s, thus
yielding 0.3571 A ≤ χ′e ≤ 0.4765 A. When the LFEs
are accounted for, the dielectric susceptibility χ′e is re-
duced significantly (by over 55%) -- different from the in-
plane motion case where the dielectric susceptibility is
increased -- and the Born charge on the B ions becomes
negative with a magnitude that is only 21% of their static
effective charge. In fact, there is a very small vibrational
contribution (only 0.013 A) to the static susceptibility
χ′0 due to this small value of Born charge; in contrast,
when LFEs are neglected, a large Born charge equal to
the static effective charge leads to an overestimation of
the vibrational contribution, which rises to a one or-
der of magnitude higher value (0.196 A). The out-of-
plane phonon frequency ωz is 836 cm−1 with the PIM
including the LFEs, which is overestimated by over 39%
when LFEs are not included.
In the RIM there is no
EP, i.e., α′1 = α′2 = 0, which causes χ′e to vanish and
consequently an extremely large out-of-plane phonon fre-
quency, ωz → ∞. In consequence the RIM fails to de-
scribe the out-of-plane vibrations.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied long wavelength optical vibrations
in ML hBN using two pairs of equations [Eqs. (39a),
(39b), (40a) and (40b)] to describe the in-plane and out-
of-plane lattice vibrations, respectively. These lattice
equations, which have similar forms to Huang's equa-
tions for bulk crystals, are deduced from a microscopic
dipole lattice model taking into account the LFEs and
EP self-consistently. The 2D Lorentz relation connecting
the macroscopic and local fields, and the use of the areal
polarization, a macroscopic quantity to describe the 2D
dielectric polarization, are fundamental to deducing the
lattice equations from the atomic theory. From the lat-
tice equations the expressions for the areal energy density
are obtained for the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice vi-
brations, respectively. The three mutually independent
a- or c-coefficients of the equations are expressed in terms
of a set of three quantities such as the 2D electronic
and static susceptibilities and the intrinsic oscillator fre-
quency, calculated from first principles, thus making the
lattice equations very useful for calculating the lattice
dynamical properties.

The lattice equations are solved simultaneously with
the equation of electrostatics to deduce the optical modes
of the TO, LO and ZO vibrations. The explicit expres-
sions have been obtained for phonon frequency, macro-
scopic field, and also phonon group velocity and density
of states. The frequency expressions are found to de-
scribe the dispersion relations of previous first-principles
calculations very well: while the TO and ZO modes are
dispersionless, the LO modes have dispersion with the
frequency increasing with the wavevector.
In particu-
lar, our LO phonon dispersion relation is identical to the
analytical expression of Sohier et al., and it evidently
shows that the LO and TO modes are degenerate at Γ
and split up at a finite wavevector due to the long-range
macroscopic field.
It is also shown that the finite ZO
phonon frequency exists owing to the electronic polar-
ization of ions, without which the frequency becomes in-
finitely large in the rigid ion model.

From the lattice equations the frequency-dependent
dielectric susceptibilities are deduced for in-plane and
out-of-plane lattice motion. By considering the response
of the lattice to a test charge with a charge distribu-
tion asymmetric or symmetric with respect to the ML,
a 2D lattice dielectric function ǫ(k, ω) is derived [expres-
sion (87)], which is shown to be due solely to the LO
vibrations, and the driven LO and ZO vibrations are fur-
ther discussed. It is also shown that such a 2D longitudi-
nal DF allows the LO phonon dispersion [expression (49)]
to be rederived from ǫ(k, ω) = 0, similar to the case of
bulk crystals. The 2D LST relation (93) and frequency -- 
susceptibility relation (81) are obtained for in-plane and
out-of-plane motion, respectively, connecting the phonon
frequencies to the 2D dielectric functions or susceptibil-
ities, which are very useful for quantifying the effects of
the macroscopic field on the phonon frequencies.

15

The analytical expressions have been applied to study
the lattice dynamical properties of ML hBN. For the in-
plane motion, two sets of three quantities from two in-
dependent first-principles calculations, one set of χe, χ0,
ω0 from Ref.[21] and the other set of χe, eB, ω0 from
Ref.[25], are used as parameters and very close results
are obtained for the calculated properties such as the
LO phonon dispersion relation, the effective spring force
constant and the vibrational contribution to the static
susceptibility. To evaluate the LFEs the unit-cell atomic
polarizability is used, which, given a dielectric suscep-
tibility, is found to be limited in an interval using the
2D Clausius-Mossotti relation. The LFEs and electronic
polarization of ions should be included simultaneously,
but otherwise neglecting either or both causes large dis-
crepancies to the calculated properties: the phonon fre-
quency at Γ is overestimated by 15%-19%, whereas the
Born charge, the LO phonon group velocity and the vi-
brational contribution to the static susceptibility are un-
derestimated by 77%, 96%, 96%, respectively. With no
ionic EP or LFEs, the LO modes display very small lin-
ear dispersion, almost flat in the long wavelength region,
which is distinct from the LO phonon dispersion calcu-
lated after accounting for both EP and LFEs. For out-
of-plane motion, using χ′e, χ′0, ωz calculated mainly from
Refs.[21, 45] as parameters, the static effective charge is
found to be different from that for in-plane motion re-
flecting anisotropy of the 3D charge density distribution.
Further, the positive B ions carry a negative Born charge
while the negative N ions move with a positive Born
charge. Similar to the in-plane motion case, the RIM can
not properly describe the out-of-plane vibrations, which,
for instance, yields a four times larger Born charge and
infinitely large phonon frequency. When the EP of ions
is included, the LFEs have significantly reduced the 2D
dielectric susceptibility and the Born charge (by 60% and
80%, respectively), different from the in-plane motion
case where the dielectric susceptibility and Born charge
are both increased substantially (by two and three times,
respectively).

Appendix A: The generalized Clausius-Mossotti

relations and intervals of the total atomic

polarizability in ML hBN

In bulk diatomic crystals the electronic susceptibility χ
relates to the atomic polarizabilities of constituent atoms
α1 and α2 by the Clausius-Mossotti relation [48, 49],

χ =

(α1 + α2)/va

1 − 4π(α1 + α2)/(3va)

.

(A1)

There is no such a simple relation for 2D hBN. Substi-
tuting Eqs. (11) and (16) into Eq. (15b), χe, the in-plane
electronic susceptibility of ML hBN, is given by [31, 33]

χe =

(α1 + α2) + 2α1α2(Q1 − Q0)

s[1 − (α1 + α2)Q0 − α1α2(Q2

1 − Q2
0)]

.

(A2)

If Q0 = Q1, then the 2D susceptibility of the dielectric
χe relates to the total atomic polarizability of the unit
cell α1 + α2 by a simple relation,

χe =

(α1 + α2)/s

1 − (α1 + α2)Q0,1

which is similar to the Clausius-Mossotti relation (A1)
for bulk materials. In fact in ML hBN Q0 6= Q1 (Sec.
II) so the sum α1 + α2 can not be determined from the
generalized Clausius-Mossotti relation (A2); adding the
Born charge expression (17) does not help because eB and
χe are related through Eq. (19) and not independent of
each other.

Interestingly, when knowing χe the upper and lower
bounds of the unit-cell atomic polarizability α1 + α2 can
be determined from expression (A2). Let α = α1 + α2.
Then Eq. (A2) can be transformed into a quadratic equa-
tion in variable α1,

Eq. (A4) has two real roots only when ∆α ≥ 0. There-
fore it follows from the ∆α expression (A5) that either

α ≥

(A6)

or

α ≤ −

Q1 − Q0

(A7)

For ML hBN (Q1 > Q0) the latter inequality leads to
only negative α and is dropped. Now one finds that α1
and α2 are given by

α1,2 =

if α1 takes the plus square root then α2 takes the minus
square root, and vice versa. For α1 and α2 to be positive,
one further requires that the above square root is not
greater than α and obtains

α ≤

1

Q0 + 1
χes

.

(A9)

Combining the inequalities (A6) and (A9) then re-
stricts the atomic polarizability in the unit cell for in-
plane polarization to the following interval,

When the 2D susceptibility χe = 0.85 A [21] is used, for
instance, one finds 1.3084 A3 ≤ α1 + α2 ≤ 1.7530 A3,
which is only a narrow range of 0.44 A3.
For the vertical polarization (parallel to ez), the elec-
tronic susceptibility χ′e can be expressed in terms of the
atomic polarizabilities α′1, α′2 as (refer to Sec. II above
and also Ref.[31])

χ′e =

(α′1 + α′2) − 4α′1α′2(Q1 − Q0)

s[1 + 2(α′1 + α′2)Q0 − 4α′1α′2(Q2

1 − Q2
0)]

.

(A11)

Following the preceding derivation we find that the
atomic polarizability of the unit cell falls in the interval,

Taking the 2D susceptibility χ′e = 0.151 A [21], one
finds 1.9329 A3 ≤ α′1 + α′2 ≤ 2.5792 A3. Mathematically,
the solution α′1 + α′2 ≥ 1/( 1
es − Q1 − Q0) is also permit-
ted, but yielding α′1 + α′2 ≥ 7.3 A3 for ML hBN, which
are much larger than the total polarizability 4.0 A3 of
the free atoms B and N (the polarizabilities of free atoms
B and N are 3.038 and 1.097 A3, respectively [50]). Us-
ing the linear volume-polarizability relationship [51], the
polarizability of a constituent atom αi in a crystal can
be estimated by αi = (vi/v0
i [52, 53], where vi is the
i and α0
effective volume of the atom in the crystal, and v0
i
are the free-atom volume and polarizability, respectively.
Numerical calculations have shown that the polarizabili-
ties of the B and N atoms in bulk h-BN are reduced com-
pared to their free-atom polarizabilities [52, 53]. Anyhow
the values α′1 + α′2 ≥ 7.3 A3 are unacceptably large to be
considered.
Compared to the their free-atom polarizability 4.0 A3,
the atoms B and N have a significantly reduced total
polarizability after forming the 2D crystal hBN. There
is a slightly larger atomic polarizability in the vertical
direction than in the layer plane, i.e., α′1 + α′2 > α1 +
α2 (with a 0.6 A3 difference in upper bound), as the
constituent B and N atoms are close packed on the plane
causing the electron cloud to be more easily deformed
and polarized along the vertical direction. If LFEs are
neglected then the dielectric susceptibilities become χe =

(α1 + α2)/s, and χ′e = (α′1 + α′2)/s, leading to χ′e > χe.
Therefore the first-principles result χe > χ′e as shown in
Ref.[21] is attributed to the LFEs.

We note that χe and χ′e are susceptibilities due to po-
larizable atoms or ions, and thus they also occur in non-
ionic 2D crystals such as graphene. For graphene expres-
sions (A2) and (A11) for χe and χ′e are still applicable
but become simpler considering there are two C atoms
in a unit cell, namely α1 = α2 and α′1 = α′2.

macroscopic theory and areal energy density in 2D

hBN

We first consider in-plane motion. Let the ions have
a displacement in the layer plane, w(ρ) = wρ(ρ), in
the presence of a point charge eν fixed at (ρ0,0), and
let us find the electric field in the monolayer (in-plane
component), Eρ(ρ, 0). The polarization P is P(r) =
[a21w(ρ) + a22Eρ(ρ, 0) + c22Ez(ρ, 0)]δ(z) upon using
Eqs. (39b) and (40b), and the Poisson equation is given
by

∇2φ(ρ, z) = 4π{∇ρ · [a21w(ρ) + a22Eρ(ρ, 0)]δ(z)

+ c22Ez(ρ, 0)δ′(z) − eνδ(ρ − ρ0)δ(z)}.

conditions ϕ−k(z) = ϕ∗k(z), w−k = w∗k and ϕ−k(−q) =
ϕ∗k(q) considering that quantities such as φ(ρ, z), w(ρ)
are real.

Taking z = 0 in Eq. (B6) and integrating ϕk(q) over q

one finds

where the latter sum represents the field due to the point
charge (including dielectric effects through a22), which is
zero at the charge site. Eq. (B9) will be used below to
calculate the work required to displace the ions or the
charge.

We have obtained Eq. (27), namely, a12 = a21, from
the microscopic dipole lattice model, and here we show
that from the viewpoint of macroscopic theory it follows
from the principle of energy conservation. Place the point
charge eν at the origin, whilst setting the ions in the
configuration w(ρ) = 0, and consider the following cy-
cle [13]: (a) keeping the charge at the origin, displace
the ions horizontally into an irrotational configuration
w(ρ) = ∇ρψ(ρ), according to

w(ρ) = ξ∇ρψ(ρ),

(B10)

by increasing ξ from 0 to 1, ψ(ρ) being a nonzero arbi-
trary scalar field; (b) keeping the ions at w(ρ) = ∇ρψ(ρ),
displace the charge to ∆ρ; (c) fixing the charge at ∆ρ,
reverse process (a), i.e., by decreasing ξ from 1 to 0 ac-
cording to Eq. (B10); (d) move the charge back to the
origin to complete the cycle.

−[a11w(ρ) + a12Eρ(ρ, 0)]· ∆w(ρ) is the work per unit
area required to change w(ρ) to w(ρ)+∆w(ρ), and total
work expended on the ionic system for the configuration
change is

−Z [a11w(ρ) + a12Eρ(ρ, 0)] · ∆w(ρ)dρ.

(B11)

From Eq. (B10) ∆w(ρ) = ∆ξ∇ρψ(ρ) follows, and
then insert expansion ψ(ρ) = Pk ψkeik·ρ into w(ρ)
[Eq. (B10)] and ∆w(ρ). Comparing the former expan-
sion with Eq. (B3) one finds wk for Eq. (B9), wk =
ξikψk. Inserting these expansions of w(ρ) and ∆w(ρ)
together with Eq. (B9) into the above expression (B11),
and integrating over ξ from 0 to 1, one obtains the work

The field acting on charge eν during process (b) is given
by setting ρ = 0 (as ∆ρ is small) and wk = ikψk in the

Process (c) is the reverse of process (a) except for the
altered position of charge eν. Therefore after reversing
the sign of expression (B12) and multiplying its latter
summands by a factor e−ik·∆ρ we find the work expended
during the process,

18

Now we consider out-of-plane motion. Let the ions
have a displacement perpendicular to the layer plane,
w(ρ) = wz(ρ), in the presence of a point charge eν placed
at (0,z0), and let us find the z-component of the field,
Ez(ρ, z). Now the polarization P is P(r) = [c21w(ρ) +
c22Ez(ρ, 0) + a22Eρ(ρ, 0)]δ(z) upon using Eqs. (39b) and
(40b)], and the Poisson equation is given by

∇2φ(ρ, z) = 4π{[c21w(ρ) + c22Ez(ρ, 0)]δ′(z)

+ a22∇ρ · Eρ(ρ, 0)δ(z) − eνδ(ρ)δ(z − z0)}. (B17)
Expanding δ(z) [Eq. (2)] and the other spatially vary-
ing quantities exactly as in the in-plane motion case
[Eqs. (B2), (B3), (B4) and (B6)], one finds from the Pois-
son equation ϕk(q),

Upon making e−ik·∆ρ = 1 − ik · ∆ρ, and changing the

one immediately obtains a12 = a21.
The relation a12 = a21 allows us to define an energy

that, similar to the bulk polar crystal case [13], it is not a
priori obvious that an energy density of this simple form
should exist for ML hBN, in particular when considering

The field acting on charge eν due to the charge itself is
Ez,eν (0, z0), i.e., the sum of the terms containing eν of
Eq. (B24), and the work done for this field can be simply
written as Wb,eν = −eνEz,eν (0, z0)∆z.
Process (c) is the reverse of process (a) except for the
displacement of charge eν. Therefore upon reversing the
sign of expression (B27) and multiplying its latter sum-
mands by a factor e−k∆z, we readily find the work ex-
pended during the process,

where the sum of the terms containing eν (wk) represents
the field due to the point charge (ionic displacements),
denoted by Ez,eν (0, z0) (Ez,w(0, z0)) for simplicity.

Now we show that c12 = c21 [Eq. (38b)] follows from
the principle of energy conservation. Place the point
charge eν above the ML at a point P (ρ0 = 0,z0), while
keeping the ions in the configuration w(ρ) = 0, and con-
sider the following cycle: (a) keeping the charge at the
point P , displace the ions vertically into the configura-
tion w(ρ) = ψ(ρ) = ψ(ρ)ez, according to

w(ρ) = ξψ(ρ)ez,

(B25)

by increasing ξ from 0 to 1; (b) keeping the ions at
w(ρ) = ψ(ρ), displace the charge vertically by a small
∆z to point P ′ (ρ0 = 0,z0 + ∆z); (c) fixing the charge at
the point P ′, reverse process (a), i.e., by reducing ξ from
1 to 0 according to Eq. (B25); (d) move the charge back
to point P to complete the cycle.

The work per unit area required to change w(ρ) to
w(ρ) + ∆w(ρ) is −[c11w(ρ) + c12Ez(ρ, 0)] · ∆w(ρ), and
thus total work expended on the ionic system for the
configuration change is

−Z [c11w(ρ) + c12Ez(ρ, 0)] · ∆w(ρ)dρ.

(B26)

From Eq. (B25) one has ∆w(ρ) = ∆ξψ(ρ)ez. Expand-
ing w(ρ) and ψ(ρ) as in-plane motion above, one finds
wk in Eq. (B23) is given by wk = ξψk. Substituting
these expansions in terms of ψk together with Eq. (B23)
into the above expression (B26), and integrating over ξ
from 0 to 1, one obtains for the work expended during
process (a),

Wc = −Xk (cid:20) 1

(B29)

During process (d) w(ρ) = 0, and according to
Eq. (B24) no field is associated with displacement w(ρ),
and accordingly no work is needed for the displacement
part, Wd,w = 0. For the field due to the point charge it-
self, the work done is given by reversing the sign of Wb,eν ,
i.e., Wd,eν = eνEz,eν (0, z0)∆z.

As Wa + Wb,w + Wb,eν + Wc + Wd,w + Wd,eν = 0, one

finds

(B30)

Using e−k∆z = 1 − k∆z, and changing the index of sum-
mation k to −k for the former summation, one readily
finds c12 = c21.
Having c12 = c21, now an areal energy density associ-
ated with the out-of-plane optical vibrations can be in-
troduced,

[wz = wz(ρ), and Ez = Ez(ρ, 0)].
