We theoretically show that buckled two-dimensional graphene-like materials (silicene and ger-
manene) subjected to a femtosecond strong optical pulse can be controlled by the optical field
component normal to their plane. In such strong fields, these materials are predicted to exhibit
non-reciprocal reflection, optical rectification and generation of electric currents both parallel and
normal to the in-plane field direction. Reversibility of the conduction band population is also field-
and carrier-envelope phase controllable. There is a net charge transfer along the material plane
that is also dependent on the normal field component. Thus a graphene-like buckled material be-
haves analogously to a field-effect transistor controlled and driven by the electric field of light with
subcycle (femtosecond) speed.

INTRODUCTION

Novel Dirac materials such as silicene or germanene
[1 -- 9] are monolayers of silicon or germanium with hexag-
onal lattice structures where charge carriers at the Fermi
surface are, as in graphene, Dirac fermions [10 -- 18]. Re-
cently, silicene has shown [19] promise for applications in
electronics such as field-effect transistors (FETs) [20 -- 23]
where, being a semiconductor, it has a natural advantage
over graphene that is a semimetal. Below we will con-
sider silicene but all qualitative results are also valid for
germanene.

In this paper we theoretically predict that a single
monolayer of silicene (germanene) is controllable at op-
tical frequencies by a normal component of the incident
optical field just like the gate voltage controls channel
current in FET. The main difference between silicene and
graphene is that due to a larger radius of a Si (or, Ge
in germanene) atom compared to a C atom, the corre-
sponding hexagon lattice in silicene has buckled structure
[24] consisting of two sublattices that are displaced ver-
tically by a finite distance Lz ∼ 0.5 A  --  see Fig. 1(a). As
a result, silicene has large spin-orbit interaction, which
opens up band gaps at the Dirac points (∆so ≈ 1.55− 7.9
meV for silicene [6, 25] and ∆so ≈ 24 − 93 meV for ger-
manene [6, 25]). For graphene, the corresponding spin-
orbit-induced gap is very small, 25 µeV [26]. The buckled
structure of silicene/germanene lattice allows also for the
band gap to be controlled by an applied perpendicular
electric field [27]: the band gap increases almost linearly
with this electric field.

Phenomena in silicene in a strong optical pulse field are
illustrated in Figs. 1(b)-(e). A strong optical field causes
electron transfer in the direction of the force [28, 29].

In fact, a strong optical field in the z-direction (normal
to the silicene plane) decreases symmetry of the system
from honeycomb (six-order, centrosymmetric) to trian-
gular (third-order, non-centrosymmetric). This leads to
appearance of effects such as optical rectification and in-
duction of currents normal to the in-plane component of
the applied electric field.

Microscopically, the z component of the strong field
causes transfer of electrons between the sublattices. As-
sume for certainty that, for the chosen pulse, electrons
are transferred from A to B. (Note that the change of the
maximum field to the opposite, i.e., change of the carrier-
envelope phase of the pulse by π, would obviously cause
an opposite transfer.) In the case of in-plane field F2D
polarized in the y-direction, there is an electron transfer
in both the y- and x-directions  --  see Fig. 1(b). The sym-
metry of the system dictates that with the reversal of F2D
(for the same z-component, Fz) the y-current changes to
the opposite but the x-current does not change, as shown
in Fig. 1(c). This implies, in particular, that the system
causes optical rectification in the x-direction, which is
due to the absence of symmetry with respect to the re-
flection in yz-plane for either sublattices.

Fundamentally different scenario takes place for F2D
in the x direction  --  see Figs. 1(d) and (e). In this case,
there is no current in the y-direction due to symmetry
with respect to reflection in the xz-plane. With respect
to field F2D changing to the opposite, the x-current does
not have any definite parity, which is rectification in the
x-direction.

To provide for the field-effect control of optical phe-
nomena in silicene, the z-component of the pulse electric
field should be strong enough: Fz (cid:38) ω/(eLz) ∼ 2 V/A,
where ω is the optical frequency. Then, necessarily, the
pulse should be very short, on the femtosecond scale,
to allow the processes to be complete before significant
damage to the lattice may have occurred  --  see Sec. II
below. For such fields, there may be partial adiabaticity
(reversibility) set on, which we will show below in Sec.
III.

Similar to graphene, the silicene/germanene mono-
layer has honeycomb lattice structure, which is shown
in Fig. 2(a). The lattice has two sublattices, labeled
√
"A" and "B", and is determined by two lattice vectors,
3,−1), where a is lat-

tice constant, which is 3.866 A for silicene and 4.063 A for
germanene. The distance between the nearest neighbors

tice is a hexagon and is shown in Fig. 2(b). The points

are the Dirac points. In the buckled structure [see Fig.
1(a)], the z-shift distance is Lz = 0.46 A and Lz = 0.66
A for silicene and germanene, respectively [31, 32].
For a graphene monolayer, where spin-orbit coupling
is extremely small ( ≈ 0.03 meV), energy gaps at the
Dirac points are correspondingly very small and can
be set as zero for any practical purposes. Then the
low energy spectra near the Dirac points are well de-
scribed by the Dirac massless relativistic equation. For
a silicene/germanene system, finite spin-orbit interaction
opens up a much larger gap ∼ 10 − 100 meV [27]. Such
a gap in the energy spectrum of silicene modifies low-
energy electron transport and interaction between elec-
trons in weak magnetic fields [33]. However, this spin-
orbit interaction is too weak and, in our case, can be
safely neglected compared to characteristic energy scale,
eFzLz, introduced by the strong electric field of the op-
tical pulse in the buckled Dirac materials. At the same
time, the buckled structure of a silicene monolayer in-
troduces strong sensitivity of the system to the external
normal field, Fz [27]. Hence, based on this consideration,
below in this article we disregard the spin-orbit interac-
tion but take into account the buckled structure bringing
about the sensitivity to the normal optical electric field.

is a two dimensional vector, F2d = (Fx(t), Fy(t)) =

matrix form of the Hamiltonian corresponds to pseudo-
spin, i.e., two components of the wave function ψA and
ψB, which describe the amplitudes for an electron to be
on the lattice site A and B, respectively.
The field-free electron Hamiltonian, H0, describes the
nearest neighbor tight-binding model of silicene without
spin-orbit terms. This Hamiltonian is exactly the same
as the free-field Hamiltonian of graphene [34 -- 37] and de-
scribes the tight-binding coupling between two sublat-
tices A and B  --  see Fig. 2(a). In the reciprocal space,
the Hamiltonian H0 is a 2× 2 matrix of the form [34, 35]

II. MODEL AND MAIN EQUATIONS

At the present time, record-setting ultrashort optical
pulses have duration ≈ 1.5 optical period [28, 30], with
duration of just a few femtoseconds. We will idealize
and simulate such an ultrashort pulse with the following
single-oscillation waveform,

F (t) = F0e−u2(cid:0)1 − 2u2(cid:1) ,

(1)

where F0 is the amplitude, which is related to the pulse
power, P = cF 2
0 /4π, c is speed of light, u = t/τ , and
τ is the pulse length, which is set τ = 1 fs. Note that
−∞ F (t)dt = 0, which is

required for a pulse propagating in far-field zone.

We consider a p-polarized laser pulse with polarization
direction parallel to the plane of incidence, orientation
of which is determined by an angle ϕ measured relative
to axis x. Here the xy coordinate system is introduced
in the plane of silicene/germanene, oriented as shown in

The electric field of the optical pulse generates both
interband and intraband electron dynamics. The inter-
band dynamics introduces coupling of the states of the
CB and VB and results in redistribution of electrons be-
tween the two bands. For dielectrics, such dynamics re-
sults in its metallization, which manifests itself as a finite
charge transfer through dielectrics and finite CB popula-
tion after the pulse ends [28, 44, 45].

In the reciprocal space, the intraband dynamics is de-

scribed by the acceleration theorem [46],

 dk
dt

= eF(t).

(8)

This acceleration theorem is universal and does not de-
pend on the dispersion law. Therefore the intraband elec-
tron dynamics is the same for both the VB and CB. The
time-dependent wave vector kT (q, t) of an electron with
initial wave vector q can be found by solving Eq. (8) as

kT (q, t) = q +

αq (r, t).

(11)

α=v,c

Solution (11) is parametrized by initial electron wave vec-
tor q. Due to the universal intraband electron dynamics
in the reciprocal space, the equations, which describe co-
herent electron dynamics in the pulse field, become de-
coupled, greatly simplifying the problem.

(τp ∼ 4 fs) is τp (cid:46) τe−e. Therefore, it is not unreason-

System of equations (12)-(13) describes the interband
electron dynamics and determines the mixing of CB and
VB states in the electric field of the pulse. For undoped
silicene, all VB states are initially occupied and all CB
states are empty. Then the initial condition for system
Eqs. (12)-(13) is (βvq, βcq) = (1, 0), and the mixing of
the states of different bands is characterized by time-
dependent component βcq(t)2. We also define the time-
dependent total CB population by the following expres-
sion,

Nc(t) =

βcq(t)2,

(19)

q

where the sum is over the first Brillouin zone. The CB
population, Nc(t), characterizes the electron dynamics
in silicene and determines whether the dynamics for the
entire system is reversible or not. Namely, the dynamics
is reversible if, after the pulse ends, the CB population,
which is the residual CB population, is small compared
to the maximum CB population throughout the pulse.

Polarization of the system in a time-dependent electric
field also generates electric current, which can be calcu-
lated in terms of the velocity operator from the following

neighbor tight binding model, silicene has electron-hole
symmetry, which results in the relation V cc

y .

Let us denote current in the i direction induced by in-
plane field F2d in the j direction as Jij, where i, j = x, y.
Similarly we denote charge transferred after the pulse
ends through the system as Qij. This is determined by
an expression

Qij =

dtJij(t),

(25)

The current can be expressed in terms of polarization
P(t) of the electron system as J(t) = dP(t)/dt. Then
the transferred charge is determined by the residual po-
larization of the system as Qij = Pij(t → ∞), where we
introduced tensor indices for P similarly to those for Jij
and Qij. The transferred charge is nonzero only due to
irreversibility of electron dynamics in the optical pulse
field. For completely reversible dynamics, when the sys-
tem returns to its initial state after the pulse, the trans-
ferred charge would be exactly zero.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Band Population Dynamics in Strong Pulse

Field

The principal distinction of silicene from graphene
is that the sublattices, A and B, are separated "verti-
cally" (i.e., in the z-direction) by an appreciable distance,
Lz ≈ 0.5 A  --  see Fig. 1(a). The strong field of the op-
tical pulse causes non-perturbative nonlinear changes in

xz plane is displayed in Figs. 3(c)-(d). In the stark con-
trast to the case of the yz polarization considered above
in the previous paragraph, here there is a dramatic dif-
ference between θ = 80◦ and θ = −80◦. This is due
to the violation in the reflection symmetry induced by
the z component of the maximum field. For the case
illustrated, this field promotes transfer of electrons pre-
dominantly toward the B sublattice  --  cf. Fig. 1(a).
For θ = 80◦ as shown in Fig. 3(c), the x component
of the maximum field, Fx < 0, promotes transfer of elec-
trons from left to right (in the direction x > 0) according
to their negative charge  --  cf. Fig. 1(d). The distance of
transfer is the same as in the case of the yz-polarized
lated since δ = ω/ (eFyLxy) (cid:38) 1. Correspondingly, the
residual CB populations N (res)
are again close to their
corresponding maxima during the pulse.
Dramatically different behavior takes place for the re-
ciprocal incidence, θ = −80◦ where the CB population ki-
netics is displayed in Fig. 3(d). For relatively weak fields,
F0 = 0.5−1.5 V/A, the kinetics is essentially irreversible,
where the maximum CB population is attained at the end
of the excitation pulse, similar to the case of Fig. 3(c)
considered above in the previous paragraph. In a sharp
contrast, for stronger fields, F0 = 2 − 3 V/A, there is
partial reversibility: at the end of the pulse the CB pop-
ulation is reduced by a factor of ≈ 2 with respect to its
maximum. This is related to improved adiabaticity, i.e.,
decreased adiabaticity parameter, δ = ω/ (eFyLxx) (cid:46) 1
3 ≈ 1.4 A is the horizontal transfer dis-
where Lxx = a/
tance, see Fig. 2(a). This distance is twice longer than
for the case of Figs. 1(c)-(d) corresponding to the polar-
izations in Figs. 3(b)-(c).

√

Note that the adiabaticity in the case of Fig. 3(d) is
incomplete; for comparison, in the case of silica (quartz)
a nearly perfect adiabaticity has been predicted and
observed [30, 49]. This high degree of adiabaticity is
most certainly related to a wide band gap, ∆g (see also
Ref. [44]) and to a significantly larger lattice constant,
a ≈ 5 A, in quartz. Both these factors determine adi-
abaticity, which is pronounced when ω/∆g (cid:28) 1 and
ω/(eF0a) (cid:28) 1. Thus one should not expect near-perfect
adiabaticity in graphene (cf. Ref. [29]), silicene, and ger-
manene where ∆g is negligible, and a is relatively small.

B. Ultrafast Currents Induced by Strong Pulse

Electrical current is due to displacement of charges
caused by the applied pulse field. For free classical elec-
trons, this current is proportional to their mean velocity,
i.e., to the integral of the field, often referred to as vector
potential,

the material. Such phenomena are sensitive to the max-
imum field of the pulse, which is amplitude F0. For our
choice of pulse Eq. (1), the maximum of the carrier oscil-
lation occurs at the maximum of the pulse envelope, i.e.,
the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) is zero  --  see Fig. 3(a)
illustrating the pulse waveform.
The CB population, Nc, calculated in accord with Eq.
(19) for pulse polarized in the yz plane is displayed in
Fig. 3(b) as a function of time t for different field am-
plitudes and incidence angle θ = ±80◦. Note that be-
cause silicene is symmetric with respect to reflection in
the xz plane, the results for both 80◦ and −80◦ are iden-
tical. Two most prominent features of this dynamics are:
(i) dependence on the pulse amplitude is very nonlinear,
and (ii) the residual (after the pulse end) populations,
N (res)
are close to the maximum populations during the
pulse. The latter property is similar to that in graphene
[29]. However, it is in a sharp contrast to that in silica,
cf. Refs. [49] (theory) and [28, 50] (experiment) where
the residual CB populations are relatively small. This
large residual CB population for silicene suggests lack of
adiabaticity, which is likely due to a relatively small dis-
tance of the transfer between the two sublattices in the xy
the adiabaticity parameter is δ = ω/ (eFyLxy). Adi-
abaticity requires δ (cid:28) 1 while, in our case, even at the
strongest fields, the adiabatic parameter is not too small,

tal lattice of silicene causes effective symmetry reduction
from honeycomb to triangular and, in particular, depen-
dence of the electron dynamics on the sign of the maxi-
mum field  --  cf. Figs. 3 (c) and (d). The observed partial
adiabaticity is also due to the presence of the periodic
lattice and defined by its period in the field direction.

The effective reduction of symmetry to triangular
(where there is no inversion center) caused by the strong
normal (z) field component causes the currents in the sil-
icene lattice to be highly anisotropic and non-reciprocal
as we show below in this Section. Let us denote JXX
an x-component of the current density induced by the
field polarized in the xz plane with the maximum in the
negative x direction as shown in Fig. 3(c). Similarly,
we denote J ¯XX the x component of the current density
caused by the field with the maximum in the positive x
direction as in the case of Fig. 3(d). Note that gener-
ally JXX (cid:54)= −J ¯XX (as would have been the case for free
electrons) due to the low, triangular effective symmetry.
Similarly, we introduce current density JY Y as the y
component of the current density induced by the yz po-
larized pulse. Note that in this case, the presence of the
xz-symmetry plane dictates that JY Y = −J ¯Y Y . Interest-
ingly enough, the in-plane field in the y direction causes
also a current in the x direction [cf. Figs. 1 (b) and (c)],

whose density we will denote as JY X . Note that due to
the symmetry, this current is invariant with respect to
inversion in the xz plane, i.e., JY X = J ¯Y X .

In Fig. 4, we plot the temporal behavior of the current
density for the four independent cases of the pulse polar-
ization and current direction, XX, ¯XX, Y Y , and Y X,
as indicated in the panels; the currents in all other cases
are either related to these cases by symmetry, as pre-
sented in the previous two paragraphs, or equal zero as,
e.g., JXY and J ¯XY . For the XX case shown in Fig. 4(a),
in the relatively weak fields, F0 ≤ 1 V/A, the current
density, JXX , obviously, qualitatively follows the vector
potential, A(t) reaching (negative) maximum at approx-
imately quarter oscillation period and turning to zero at
the maximum field (t = 0). Kinetics JXX (t) is approxi-
mately antisymmetric with respect to point t = 0, which
shows that this process is nearly time-reversible.

However, at higher fields, the behavior in Fig. 4(a) be-
comes nontrivial. The first manifestation of this behavior
appears at F0 = 1.5 V/A where instead of a pronounced
minimum (maximum negative current) there is a plateau,
which turns to a maximum for F0 ≥ 2 V/A. We attribute
this behavior to electrons that are compelled by the field
force to drift in the reciprocal space across the K-point.
We will discuss this behavior in more detail in conjunc-
tion with Fig. 4(c)  --  see below.

A phenomenon of fundamental importance is the loss
of adiabaticity in higher fields, which manifests itself in
the lack of anti-symmetry with respect to point t =
0 in Fig. 4(a). Note that non-adiabaticity also im-
plies irreversibility [53] and, consequently, violation of
time-reversal symmetry (called also T-invariance or T-
symmetry). This violation of adiabaticity is related to a
gradual transfer of population between the A and B sub-
lattices, as we discussed above in Sec. III A. Such transfer
is not instantaneous; one can estimate characteristic time
it requires as ttr ∼ π/(eLzF0). For a high field used,

This is in a full quali-
tative agreement with the results of Fig. 4(a) where the
time-reversal asymmetry becomes pronounced for high
fields and times longer than ∼ 1 fs from the moment the
pulse is applied.

One of the consequences of the T-invariance violation
are non-zero values of the transferred charge and of the
residual polarization  --  see Eq. (25) and Fig. 6 and the
corresponding discussion  --  violating the T-symmetry and
adiabaticity. This implies that the system's dynamics is
irreversible (non-adiabatic), which may surprise one be-
cause the system is completely Hamiltonian. This is due
to the fact that the central frequency of the laser radi-
ation, ω ≈ 1.5 eV, is close to the transition frequency
between the electron states localized at the two sublat-
tices, ∆ω ∼ π/ttr = eLzF0 ∼ 1.4 eV. This causes
resonant absorption leading to dephasing  --  collisionless
relaxation widely known as Landau damping [51].

Current kinetics for the ¯XX case displayed in Fig. 4(b)
is qualitatively similar to that for the XX case discussed
above in the previous three paragraphs. However, the
symmetry reduction caused by the nonlinear interaction
with a controlled (zero in our case) CEP causes current
J ¯XX to differ quantitatively from JXX , which difference
is pronounced in the second half-period (t > 0) where the
T-asymmetry of the current becomes evident. The latter
is due to the non-adiabaticity, already mentioned above
in the discussion of Fig. 4(a): the transfer of the electrons
between sublattices occurs during a finite period of time,
ttr ∼ π/(eLzF0) ∼ 1 fs, comparable with half optical
period in our case.

The Y Y case illustrated in Fig. 4(c) is not related
by crystal symmetry or other invariances to the XX
and ¯XX cases considered above. However, the kinet-
ics of JY Y is qualitatively similar to, though quantita-
tively different from, the previous two cases. Note that
there is strict symmetry J ¯Y Y = −JY Y . Here also the
T-symmetry is violated: the kinetics in the first and sec-
ond half-periods is dramatically different. Note that in
this case, current at the end of the pulse may not van-
ish, which is certainly due to absence of collisions and
other interactions in the model. Note that the electron-
electron collisions is the fastest interaction-induced re-
laxation process. However, it takes the electron-electron
collisions ∼ 10 − 20 fs in a similar two-dimensional sys-
tem, graphene, to make an effect [41], which is too long
time for our pulse whose entire duration is less than 4 fs.
The results for current JY X (in the x direction induced
by the field in the y direction) are displayed in Fig. 4(d).
Note that exactly JY X = J ¯Y X due to symmetry. With-
out an electric field applied, silicene is a center-symmetric
solid. Therefore for low fields current JY X should van-
ish. This is, in fact, the case with a good accuracy for
F0 = 0.5 V/A, as one can see in the Fig. 4(d). With
field increasing, there is an increased current JY X . Pre-
dominantly, it is directed along the negative x axis, as is
understandable from comparison with Figs. 1(b) and (c).
Note that magnitude of this current is approximately an

order of magnitude smaller than JY Y .
The origin of the current oscillations for strong fields,
F0 ≥ 2 V/A, in Figs. 4(a)-(c) can be understood from the
electron momentum distribution. Consider for certainty
the YY case, where the current is shown in Fig. 4(c).
The corresponding momentum distribution for electrons
in the CB, βck2, for pulse field amplitude F0 = 2.5 V/A
is displayed in in Fig. 5(a) for moment of time t = −1.3 fs,
corresponding to the minimum (the maximum negative
value) of the current, JY Y . At this instance, which just
precedes the current oscillation, excess electron popu-
lation (depicted by green) is concentrated at ky < 0,
kx = 0. This excess population is formed due to field
force eFy(t) > 0 that pushes the electrons across the K
points into the second Brillouin zone in the extended zone
picture; these electrons appear in the first Brillouin zone
at the K point at ky ≈ −1 A−1, kx = 0. The second lo-
calization of electrons is around a K(cid:48) point at kx = 1 A−1.
This electron population is formed due to the lack of the
center symmetry in the presence of strong field Fz, i.e.,
it has the same origin at current JY X described above in
the previous paragraph.
Dramatically different electron distribution is dis-
played in Fig. 5(b) for t = −0.7 fs when current JY Y
experiences the maximum upswing. This is caused by a
significant number of electrons in the CB with ky > 0
which appear due to a drift in the reciprocal space under
force eFy > 0. These electrons make a positive contri-
bution to the current (their group velocity vg < 0; cor-
respondingly, due to e < 0, their contribution to JY Y is
positive).

The currents described above in conjunction with Fig.
4 cause transfer of charge across the system and accu-
mulation of charges by the end of the pulse as given by
Eq. (25). Such charge Q transferred through the system
is displayed as a function of the field amplitude, F0, in
Fig. 6 for four independent combinations of the field and
current directions, XX, ¯XX, Y Y , and Y X. A remark-

XXXXYYYXF0 (V/Å)_5-5-10-150012Charge density  (nC/m) able property of these results is that in all cases, except
for Y X, the charge transferred changes its sign as the
field amplitude increases. This can be attributed to the
increased number of electrons experiencing the Bragg re-
flections at the Brillouin zone boundary, especially at the
K-points, with the field increase. Thus this sign change of
the transferred charge has the same origin as the current
oscillations in Fig. 4 as described above. This charge ac-
cumulated at the pulse end is an experimentally observ-
able quantity just as the previous experiments on cur-
rents in dielectrics [28, 52]. On the order of magnitude,
this accumulated charge in Fig. 6 is Q ∼ 1 fC/µm. For
a ∼ 1 µm focused spot, this gives a ∼ 1 fC transferred
charge. Such a charge is on the same order of magni-
tude as in experiments Refs. [28, 52] and is, in principle,
reliably observable.

IV. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION

The accumulation of charge Q transferred through the
system implies a dramatic manifestation of symmetry vi-
olation. This charge accumulation violates simultane-
ously the parity symmetry (P-symmetry) and the charge-
inversion symmetry (C-symmetry). This violation hap-
pens due to the fact that our pulse is short and has a
controlled CEP (zero in our case): the maximum field
is reached at the maximum of the envelope (instance
t = 0). Due to strong nonlinearity of the system for
fields F0 (cid:38) 1 V/A applied, this maximum field defines a
selected direction in the system plane for the force act-
ing on electrons. This causes the violation of the C-
and P-symmetries. This is actually a general property
for systems subjected to a short, strong, CEP-controlled
pulses. It takes place in both two-dimensional solids such
as graphene, silicene, germanene, and also conventional
three-dimensional solids such as fused silica, sapphire,
etc.
In particular, it was a fundamental origin for the
charge transfer in silica and quartz in original experi-
ments [28].

A symmetry violation specific for silicene is related
to the electron transfer between the sublattices caused
by the normal field component Fz, which effectively re-
duces the system's symmetry from hexagonal to trian-
gular. This causes non-reciprocity: J ¯XX (cid:54)= JXX and
the appearance of a cross-current, JXY (cid:54)= 0. Note that
anisotropicity in the xy plane, JXX (cid:54)= JY Y , is inherent
in both silicene and graphene.

8

Our zero-CEP pulse is T-symmetric; in the absence
of the T-symmetry violation, the current should be T-
odd, which would preclude the accumulation of charges
after the pulse. However, we have seen from the results
of Figs. 4(a)-(c) that the current is not anti-symmetric
in time, i.e., there is a significant violation of the T-
symmetry, which we attribute to the Landau damping.
This is inherent in both graphene and silicene and is
due to the absence of a significant band gap; this is
in contrast to silica that is almost perfectly T-reversible
[28, 30]. An additional contribution to T-irreversibility
stems from the fact that the frequency associated with
the electron transfer in the normal direction, eFzLz/, is
on the same order as the carrier frequency of the pulse.
This causes resonant absorption of the excitation pulse
and the Landau damping, specific for the silicene (and
also germanene). If adiabaticity were present, it would
have guaranteed reversibility and would have forbidden
the charge accumulation.

Finally, we note a close analogy of silicene with
In FET, the
the field-effect transistor (FET) [20 -- 23].
gate field, applied normally to the conducting channel,
changes the carrier populations in it and, thereby, con-
trols its conductance. Analogously, in silicene, the nor-
mal field component, Fz, transfers carriers to one of the
sublattices, A or B, thereby changing the system's re-
sponse to the in-plane field. A fundamental difference
(and advantage) of silicene is that such a "device" works
at optical frequencies, with the response time on the
(sub)femtosecond scale. This opens a potential for many
applications of silicene in future Petahertz-speed devices
and applications.
