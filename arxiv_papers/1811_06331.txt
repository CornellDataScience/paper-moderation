Coherent optical spectroscopy such as four-wave mixing and photon echo generation deliver de-
tailed information on the energy levels involved in optical transitions through the analysis of po-
larization of the coherent response.
In semiconductors, it can be applied to distinguish between
different exciton complexes, which is a highly non-trivial problem in optical spectroscopy. We de-
velop a simple approach based on photon echo polarimetry, in which polar plots of the photon
echo amplitude are measured as function of the angle ϕ between the linear polarizations of the
two exciting pulses. The rosette-like polar plots reveal a distinct difference between the neutral
and charged exciton (trion) optical transitions in semiconductor nanostructures. We demonstrate
this experimentally by photon echo polarimetry of a 20-nm-thick CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum well
at temperature of 1.5 K. Applying narrow-band optical excitation we selectively excite different
exciton complexes including the exciton, the trion, and the donor-bound exciton D0X. We find that
polarimetry of the photon echo on the trion and D0X is substantially different from the exciton:
The echoes of the trion and D0X are linearly polarized at the angle 2ϕ with respect to the first pulse
polarization and their amplitudes are weakly dependent on ϕ. While on the exciton the photon
echo is co-polarized with the second exciting pulse and its amplitude scales as cos ϕ.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Four-wave mixing (FWM) spectroscopy provides pre-
cise and distinct responses for the different energy level
schemes of electronic systems.
This was originally
demonstrated in gases for different atomic transitions
[1, 2]. Being applied to semiconductor nanostructures
FWM delivers detailed information on the coherent car-
rier and exciton dynamics [3].

In order to address and manipulate particular optical
transitions in semiconductor nanostructures, the under-
lying exciton complexes such as neutral excitons, charged
excitons, bound excitons, biexcitons, etc. should be first
identified. Often this is not easy to accomplish when
the spectrum is contributed by several exciton complexes
that may spectrally overlap so that their identification is
difficult. Even when they can be spectrally separated,
their assignment often is complicated as it requires de-
tailed knowledge of the complexes binding energies that
are often not known sufficiently accurate. The typical ap-
proach then is to employ magneto-optical methods such
as detection of polarized photoluminescence, requiring
application of strong external magnetic fields [4 -- 7]. Us-
ing polarization-dependent FWM, and in particular pho-
ton echo (PE) spectroscopy, makes it possible to per-

form such an identification without applying the mag-
netic field.

In semiconductor nanostructures, FWM and PE tech-
niques involving laser pulse sequences with precisely con-
trolled polarizations can be efficiently used as tool to
study different exciton complexes such as neutral exci-
tons [8], charged excitons (trions) [9, 10], and biexci-
tons [11, 12]. These techniques have been applied to
investigate exciton localization [13], many-body interac-
tions [14 -- 16], and excitation-induced dephasing of exci-
tons [17]. Various protocols of polarized excitation have
been used in order to study the coherence of spectrally
overlapping exciton states, positively charged trions, and
biexcitons in an ensemble of InAs/GaAs quantum dots
by two-dimensional Fourier-transform spectroscopy [18].

Polarization-dependent FWM on excitons in semicon-
ductor nanostructures has been subject of extensive re-
search for more than twenty years, however, the major-
ity of studies has been performed in GaAs-based sys-
tems, such as quantum wells (QWs) [13 -- 16].
In order
to understand the complex coherent behavior of excitons
localized in GaAs/(Al,Ga)As QWs various nontrivial en-
ergy level schemes have been suggested, involving com-
plex selection rules [12, 16, 19]. Moreover, application of
spectrally broad femtosecond laser pulses, as often used
in FWM spectroscopy, results in excitation of multiple
optical states. This unavoidably causes complex many-
body interactions affecting the optical selection rules and
causing excitation-induced dephasing that shortens the

coherent dynamics of the studied optical states.

In this paper, we exploit four-wave mixing spec-
troscopy with polarization sensitivity to study the po-
larimetry of photon echoes detected from different exci-
ton complexes in a semiconductor quantum well. We take
advantage of picosecond laser pulses to selectively ex-
cite individual optical states in a CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te single
QW including the neutral exciton (X), the negative trion
(T), and the donor-bound exciton (D0X). This avoids
simultaneous generation of multiple optical excitations,
which strongly reduces the efficiency of many-body inter-
actions. Operating in the weak excitation regime, we find
different polarization properties for the photon echoes
from the neutral and charged excitons. Additionally, we
perform polarimetry of the photon echoes on D0X, which
has not been studied so far with polarization sensitivity.
We approve that D0X exhibits a photon echo polarimetry
that is in full accordance with the trion model.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

First, we consider the expected polarization properties
of the photon echoes on the trion and exciton in a simple
theoretical model. Their typical energy schemes with the
allowed optical transitions are shown in Fig. 1. The neg-
ative trion scheme consists of a degenerate pair of levels
with resident electron spin projections ±1/2(cid:105) and an-
other pair of levels with trion spin projections ±3/2(cid:105) in
the ground and excited states of the crystal, respectively.
The neutral donor-bound exciton (D0X) is formed from
an electron bound to a donor in the ground state and can
be described by a similar level scheme.

In case of the exciton, we consider a simple V-type
three-level energy scheme implying that the biexciton
binding energy is sufficiently large (about 4.5 meV [20]),
so that resonant excitation of the exciton does not drive
the biexciton transition. Such a scheme has zero angu-
lar momentum projection in the crystal ground state and
±1(cid:105) in the excited state, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Due to
the optical selections rules, only the optical transitions
with difference ±1 in angular momentum projection are
allowed, as indicated by the red and blue arrows corre-
sponding to σ+ and σ− photons, respectively.

arbitrary units.

where ∆ is the oscillator detuning.

B. Exciton

We solve Eq. (1) for the following sequence of opera-
tions on the system, as shown in Fig. 1(c): The system
is excited by the first laser pulse during time interval tp
with constant circular components f1±. Then the system
experiences free evolution during the time interval τ − tp,
which is followed by the action of the second laser pulse
with components f2±. After the second period of free
evolution during the time interval τ − tp/2 the oscilla-
tors rephase and the photon echo polarization builds up,
which is analyzed in a specific polarization. Considering
the initial density matrix ρ0 with the only nonzero terms
11 = ρ0
ρ0
22 = 1/2, we find the following analytical solu-
tion for the circular components of the PE field from the
trion:

We perform the equivalent procedure for the exciton.
The initial 3×3 density matrix has only the ground state
populated, ρ0
11 = 1, and the Hamiltonian reads as follows:

The angle between the linear polariza-
tions of the exciting pulses, ϕ, is varied and the polariza-
tion of the PE is analyzed. Namely, we analyze the PE
polarization by probing it in a certain linear polarization
(detection), as described in detail below.
To specify a certain polarization scheme for the excita-
tion and detection we use the notation in form: HV→H.
Here, the polarizations of the two exciting pulses and
of the analyzed one are indicated correspondingly before
and after the arrow. The symbols H, V, D, and A corre-
spond to the polarization angles ϕj = 0◦, 90◦, 45◦, and
135◦(j = 1, 2, d), as indicated in Fig. 1(d).

Now we use Eqs. (2)-(4) to calculate the expected PE
polarization from the trion (D0X) and the exciton gen-
erated by the two linearly polarized pulses. The linearly
polarized excitation of the j-th exciting pulse (j = 1, 2)
with amplitude Ej and tilt angle ϕj can be expressed in

It is worth noting that any kind of FWM response mea-
sured in the χ(3)-regime including the free-polarization
decay (self-diffraction of the second pulse) or the photon
echo should obey the same polarization rules as described
by Eqs. (3) -- (6).

The polarized PE when the first pulse is H-polarized
and the ϕ2 angle is varied, calculated using Eqs. (3) -- 
(6), is shown in Fig. 2(d) and 2(e) for the trion (D0X)
and the exciton, respectively. For brevity, due to their
characteristic shape the polar diagrams resulting from
this analysis will be called polar rosettes in the following.
In the considered excitation sequence, the trion (D0X)
PE is linearly polarized with the angle ϕPE = 2ϕ2 and
the PE amplitude is independent of ϕ2. This is shown
in Fig. 2(d) with the solid line circle. Detection of
the H-polarized component results in the photon echo
H(ϕ2) ∝  cos 2ϕ2, which produces four maxima in the
PET
configurations HH→H and HV→H (the blue dot line).
Correspondingly, detection of the V-polarized compo-
V(ϕ2) ∝  sin 2ϕ2 with four maxima in the
nent gives PET
HD→V and HA→V configurations.

The same excitation sequence applied to the exciton
should result in the photon echo being co-polarized with
the second pulse (ϕPE = ϕ2) with the PE amplitude
∝  cos ϕ2. This is shown by the two black dashed circles
in Fig. 2(e). The H-component of the exciton photon

4
H (ϕ2) ∝ cos2 ϕ2 displays only two maxima in
echo PEX
the HH→H configuration and zero signal in the HV→H
configuration. The four-lobe V-component of the exciton
V (ϕ2) ∝  sin 2ϕ2/2 is similar to that of
photon echo PEX
the trion PE, but twice smaller in magnitude.

of the structure growth can be found in Ref. [21]. The
structure was not intentionally doped with donors and
the resident electron density nd (cid:54) 1010 cm2 is due to an
unavoidable background of impurities.
Illumination of
the sample by a weak unfocused green cw-laser above
barrier (photon energy 2.33 eV) was used to generate
photo-injected carriers, which results in an increased
population density of trions. Figure 2(a) displays the
photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the studied QW
measured at the temperature of 1.5 K. It manifests lines
of the heavy hole exciton Xhh, the negatively charged
exciton (trion) T located 2.8 meV below, and the neutral
donor-bound exciton D0X split off from the trion by
0.6 meV.

To generate photon echoes and study the PE po-
larimetry we implement a time-resolved four-wave mix-
ing technique [22]. The sample mounted in a helium
bath cryostat and cooled down to 1.5 K is excited by
a sequence of two picosecond laser pulses generated by a
tunable Ti:sapphire laser. The first and second pulses
with wavevectors k1 and k2, respectively, are focused
into a spot of about 200 µm in diameter. Their direc-
tions are close to the sample normal. The pulses are
separated in time by a variable delay τ tuned by means
of an optical delay line. The laser pulse duration is about
2 ps. The FWM signal is collected in the reflection with
wavevector 2k2 − k1 and mixed with an additional refer-
ence pulse on the photodetector, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
This optical heterodyning is applied in order to accom-
plish a background-free high-sensitivity measurement of
the FWM signal. The modulus of the cross-correlation
of the FWM signal amplitude EFWM with the reference
pulse field ERef is detected at the output of the pho-
todetector: SFWM ∝ EFWME∗
Ref. Thus, only the po-
larization component of the FWM signal defined by the
reference pulse is measured. A detailed description of
this technique can be found in Ref. [23].

Figure 2(c) demonstrates a typical FWM transient
measured at the trion resonance (1.5981 eV) for a de-
lay τ = 40 ps. The observed coherent burst occurring
at 2τ = 80 ps delay is the PE pulse convoluted with the
reference pulse. In the following we study the PE ampli-
tude when the reference pulse is centered exactly at 2τ
delay.

It is known from previous studies carried out on the
same QW structure that optical excitation at elevated
power densities may result in coherent Rabi flops of the
PE amplitude accompanied by temporal shifts of the
echo pulse, which were recently studied using the time-
resolved FWM technique [21]. In order to avoid this ef-
fect and stay in the quasi-linear χ(3)-regime we employ
low-power pulses providing a total pulse power below
20 nJ/cm2. The Xhh, T, and D0X optical transitions
in this QW were also studied with temporal and spectro-
scopic resolutions, and the spectral dependence of the co-
herence time T2 was measured [21]. Here we focus mostly
on the polarization properties of the photon echoes from
these transitions.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND

DISCUSSION

In order to reveal differences in the polarization prop-
erties of the photon echoes on the trion (D0X) and the
exciton we excite the QW with an H-polarized first pulse
(ϕ1 = 0◦) and vary the polarization angle of the second
pulse ϕ2 = 0...360◦. The detected PE is analyzed at
ϕd = 0◦ (H) and 90◦ (V) by a proper choice of the ref-
erence pulse polarization. Additionally, the polarization
of the detection is varied synchronously with the second
pulse polarization, ϕd = 2ϕ2 or ϕd = ϕ2. This allows
us to measure the photon echo amplitude in its expected
linear polarization both from the trion (D0X) and the
exciton, respectively.

Polarimetry of photon echo

Figures 2(f) and 2(g) display polar rosettes of the po-
larimetric echo signals measured on the D0X at energy of
1.5972 eV and on the exciton at energy of 1.6008 eV. The
pulse delays used in these measurements are τ = 53 ps
and 3.3 ps. The measurements on both systems are in
good agreement with the theoretical expectations. There
is, however, some reduction of the PE signal measured
on D0X in the HV→H polarization configuration, which
appears as a squeezing of the trion (D0X) polar rosette
along the V-direction.

From these rosettes we can extract distinct differences,
which can be used to identify the trion and the exci-
ton contributions to the PE polarimetric signal: In the
HV→H polarization configuration the trion has a strong
PE signal, while the exciton exhibits almost zero signal.
In the HD→H configuration, on the other hand, the ex-
citon provides half of the maximal PE amplitude (mea-
sured in HH→H), while the trion manifests no PE signal.
Using these characteristics we accomplish photon echo
polarimetry with spectroscopic resolution aimed at ob-
serving separately the trion and exciton contributions to
the echo signal. To carry out such a separation of con-
tributions we tune the laser energy in the vicinity of op-
tical transitions present and detect the PE amplitude in
different polarization configurations at a relatively short
pulse delay (τ = 3.3 ps). These spectroscopic measure-
ments are presented in Fig. 3(b). The PE amplitude
in the HH→H configuration (PEHH→H, black solid line),
which is not sensitive to the type of the optical transition,
exhibits five resonant lines: Additionally to the donor-
bound exciton D0X (1.5972 eV), the trion T (1.5982 eV),
and the heavy hole exciton Xhh (1.6008 eV) present also
in the PL spectrum [Fig. 2(a)] the spectral lines of the
light hole exciton at 1.6158 eV and the 1S state of the
Xe2-hh2 exciton at 1.6266 eV are observed. All features
are broadened due to convolution with the laser pulse
with a full width at half-maximum of 0.9 meV.
Detection in the HV→H configuration results in a
substantially different spectrum (PEHV→H in Fig. 3(b),
cyan dash-dotted line), which deviates strongly from the
PEHH→H spectrum in the vicinity of the heavy hole ex-
citon and manifests zero signal around the light hole ex-
citon and the Xe2-hh2 exciton.
The PE spectrum measured in the HD→H configu-
ration (PEHD→H) is plotted in Fig. 3(b) scaled twofold
with the orange dashed line. By the contrast, it corre-
lates strongly with the PEHH→H data in the vicinity of
the Xhh, Xlh, and Xe2-hh2 exciton transitions and is sub-
stantially reduced around the D0X and trion resonances.
Figure 3(c) displays the spectral dependences of
both the trion (squares) and exciton (circles) contri-
butions to the PE signal obtained as the signal ra-
tios PEHV→H/PEHH→H and 2PEHD→H/PEHH→H, re-
spectively. In the low-energy range these spectra clearly
demonstrate a separation of the two different types of
optical transitions. The echo signal measured below

6

1.5988 eV manifests mostly trion contributions, however,
some contribution of the exciton signal is also observed.
This effective exciton contribution is associated with the
reduction of the trion echo signal in the HV→H polariza-
tion configuration, shown before. It is remarkable that
both light hole Xlh and Xe2-hh2 exciton features that are
far from any trion transitions display pure excitonic char-
acter (PEHV→H = 0).

The polar rosettes measured by the procedure de-
scribed above on every of the optical transitions are
shown in the panels of Fig. 3(a). One can see from
these polar rosettes that the trion excited at the energy
of 1.5982 eV exhibits an even stronger reduction of the
PEHV→H component than the D0X excited at 1.5972 eV.
The polar rosettes measured on the Xlh and Xe2-hh2 ex-
citons are similar to those obtained by the theoretical
model for the neutral exciton [Fig. 2(e)].

PEHV→H/PEHH→H of
the trion (D0X) PE signals
changes with the pulse delay τ we measure the ex-
ponential PE decays by varying τ and detecting the
PE amplitude for co-polarized and cross-polarized
excitation. The decays of the PE signal on D0X,
shown in Fig. 4, manifest slightly different coherence
times, T2(HH→H)=91 ps and T2(HV→H)=82 ps, and
amplitudes. We checked that rotation of the whole
polarization basis by 90◦ produces similar results, i.e.
T2(VV→V)=T2(HH→H) and T2(VH→V)=T2(HV→H).
Similar measurements on the trion (1.5982 eV) gave
T2(HH→H)=73 ps and T2(HV→H)=67 ps (decays not
shown). The inset in Fig. 4 displays the ratios of the PE
decay fits in the cross- and co-polarized configurations
for both the D0X and T transitions. We do not discuss
the origin of the small coherence time difference here and
leave this subject for future studies. We conclude that
the observed type of anisotropy does not relate, in lowest
approximation, to the crystal axes orientation, but is a
fundamental property of the studied optical transitions
excited in the co- or cross-polarized configuration.

B. Discussion

Polarization-dependent FWM and PE generation on
excitons in semiconductor QWs have been intensively
studied before. Yaffe et al. observed a strong reduc-
tion of the exciton echo intensity for cross-polarized ex-
citation of 3-nm-thick GaAs/(Al,Ga)As QWs, although
the echo polarization was not analyzed [24]. Schneider
and Ploog observed the correspondence of the PE polar-
ization to the second pulse polarization, as well as the
absence of the echo signal in cross-polarized excitation of
the exciton in a 12-nm-thick GaAs/AlAs QW at low tem-
perature [8]. The complete set of Stokes parameters of
the FWM response from the exciton in GaAs/(Al,Ga)As
multiple QWs was measured and analyzed with femtosec-
ond temporal resolution by Paul et al.
[15]. They con-
cluded that, in general, the polarization of the FWM

shows a polarimetry of photon echoes that is in a close
correspondence to the 4-level trion model. We believe
that this is due to stronger localization of D0X than of
the trion.

As an extension, the presented method can be used to
study other exciton complexes.
In particular, the pos-
itive trion, as well as the neutral acceptor-bound exci-
ton (A0X), have a similar energy scheme as the negative
trion, so that the trion polar rosette is expected to show
up in their PE polarimetry. Similarly, the ionized donor-
bound exciton (D+X) and the ionized acceptor-bound
exciton (A−X) are expected to exhibit exciton-like polar
rosettes.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have suggested a photon echo polarimetry method
to identify the origin of the exciton complexes in semi-
conductor nanostructures. To prove this method, we ad-
justed the FWM technique for precise polarimetric mea-
surements by providing sufficient spectroscopic resolution
and applied it to the CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum well.
Using certain polarization protocols in optical excitation
and analyzing the polarization of the photon echoes we
have clearly distinguished between the trion and the ex-
citon. We have shown that the donor-bound exciton, due
to its energy level structure, manifests polarization prop-
erties of photon echoes qualitatively similar to those of
the trion. The neutral excitons generate photon echoes
in accordance to a simple V-type system. Deviations of
the observed photon echo polarimetry from the presented
simple theoretical models may be studied to understand
coherent interactions between the different exciton com-
plexes which may cause modifications in the optical se-
lection rules. In particular, the photon echo polarimetry
can be applied to materials, in which the exciton com-
plexes are known to have complex optical selection rules
or have not been studied well so far. Among them, mate-
rials such as halide perovskites [27, 28] or transition metal
dichalcogenide monolayers [29 -- 34] can be suggested. Ad-
ditionally, wurtzite ZnO-based materials are of interest,
for which robust coherent dynamics of the different op-
tical transitions were recently observed though photon
echoes [35, 36].

signal is highly elliptical and shows a complex temporal
dynamics. This was explained by complex many-body
interactions and a five-level scheme of the involved opti-
cal transitions. The group of Cundiff published several
papers on polarization-dependent photon echoes on ex-
citons localized in GaAs/(Al,Ga)As QWs [13, 16, 25].
These studies, however, deal with strong optical excita-
tion causing many-body interactions to strongly affect
the coherent dynamics of excitons and the optical selec-
tion rules. Wagner et al. employed FWM spectroscopy
using femtosecond pulses and different polarization pro-
tocols of excitation to distinguish between the trion and
the biexciton [9], and between the heavy-heavy-hole biex-
citon and heavy-light-hole biexciton possessing different
optical selection rules [11] in a single ZnSe/(Zn,Mg)Se
QW.

In the present paper, we have chosen the model system
of a CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te QW with spectrally well isolated
optical transitions, that was previously studied by other
FWM-based techniques [21, 26].
In particular, to pre-
cisely distinguish between the donor-bound exciton and
trion transitions three-pulse photon echo spectroscopy in
an external magnetic field was carried out [26]. These
two optical transitions were distinguished using a differ-
ence in the g-factor, whose spectral dependence revealed
a step-like behavior in the relevant spectral range. In an-
other FWM study optical Rabi flops could be observed
in the photon echo amplitude on the same sample [21].
The flops manifested a substantial difference between the
D0X and the trion: Rabi oscillations from D0X experi-
ence less damping compared to the trion. Based on the
different FWM studies, it can be generally concluded that
D0X tends to be substantially more robust in the coher-
ent optical behavior than the trion. In addition to the
longer-lived coherent dynamics, here we find that D0X
