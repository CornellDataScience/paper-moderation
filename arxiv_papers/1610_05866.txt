Dirac fermions are actively investigated, and the discovery of the quantized anomalous Hall effect
of massive Dirac fermions has spurred the promise of low-energy electronics. Some materials hosting
Dirac fermions are natural platforms for interlayer coherence effects such as Coulomb drag and
exciton condensation. Here we determine the role played by the anomalous Hall effect in Coulomb
drag in massive Dirac fermion systems. We focus on topological insulator films with out-of plane
magnetizations in both the active and passive layers. The transverse response of the active layer is
dominated by a topological term arising from the Berry curvature. We show that the topological
mechanism does not contribute to Coulomb drag, yet the longitudinal drag force in the passive layer
gives rise to a transverse drag current. This anomalous Hall drag current is independent of the active-
layer magnetization, a fact that can be verified experimentally. It depends non-monotonically on
the passive-layer magnetization, exhibiting a peak that becomes more pronounced at low densities.
These findings should stimulate new experiments and quantitative studies of anomalous Hall drag.

The past decade has witnessed an energetic exploration
of Dirac fermions in materials ranging from graphene [1]
to topological insulators [2], transition metal dichalco-
genides [3] and Weyl and Dirac semimetals [4 -- 6]. Dirac
fermions in 2D are described by the Hamiltonian HD =
A σ · (k × z) + M σz, with σ = (σx, σy, σz) the usual
Pauli matrices, k = (kx, ky) the 2D wave vector, A stems
from the Fermi velocity and M a generic mass term. In
the limit M → 0 the quasi-particle dispersion is lin-
ear, a feature that has aroused intense interest experi-
mentally [7 -- 21] and theoretically [22 -- 34]. These stud-
ies have illuminated the considerable potential of Dirac
fermions for spintronics, thermoelectricity, magnetoelec-
tronics and topological quantum computing [35].

Certain materials hosting Dirac fermions, such as 3D
topological insulator (TI) slabs, are inherently two-layer
systems naturally exhibiting interlayer coherence effects
such as Coulomb drag [36 -- 38], in which the charge cur-
rent in one layer drags a charge current in the adja-
cent layer through the interlayer electron-electron inter-
actions. Drag geometries are intensively studied experi-
mentally in Dirac fermion systems as part of the search
for exciton condensation [39 -- 68]. The most promising
Dirac fermion materials have been magnetic TI slabs, in
which a dissipationless quantized anomalous Hall effect
has been discovered [69 -- 72], which has already been har-
nessed successfully [73], stimulating an intense search for
device applications. The time-reversal symmetry break-
ing required in Hall effects [3, 28, 74 -- 77] gives Dirac
fermions a finite mass and results in a non-trivial Berry
curvature [3, 78, 79]. Coulomb drag of massive Dirac
fermions is thus directly relevant to ongoing experiments,
and raises important questions: if topological terms are
present in the drag current they could be exploited in
longitudinal transport, enabling a topological transistor.

Here we present a complete theory of Coulomb drag
of massive Dirac fermions. The central findings of our
work are that (i) the anomalous Hall current in the ac-

Figure 1:
Contributions to the drag current in magnetic
TIs. The electric field gives rise to a longitudinal (jx) and an
anomalous Hall (jAHE) current in the active layer. In the pas-
sive layer there are four contributions: jll is the longitudinal
current dragged by jx; jlh is the transverse current dragged
by jAHE; jhl is the anomalous Hall current generated by jll;
while jhh is the anomalous Hall current generated by jlh, and
it flows longitudinally. Ma and Mp are the magnetizations
of the active and passive layers, respectively. d is the layer
separation.

tive layer does not generate a drag current in the passive
layer (Fig. 1), and (ii) the remaining drag current only
depends on Mp, the magnetization of the passive layer.
Its dependence on Mp is non-monotonic, with a peak at
an intermediate value of Mp, which becomes pronounced
at low densities. Although derived here using a minimal
model for Dirac fermions, these results apply generally
to materials with Rashba spin-orbit interactions. They
stand in sharp contrast to conventional Coulomb drag in
ordinary Hall systems [49, 61, 63, 64, 80]. There the Hall
current in the active layer, caused by the Lorentz force
rather than topology, makes a significant contribution to
the drag response, which depends on the applied mag-
netic field. This work is intended to stimulate further
experiments and quantitative studies on state-of-the-art
samples, in which the above results can be verified.

and bottom (passive) surfaces magnetized either through
doping with magnetic impurities or proximity coupling to
ferromagnets. The magnetizations of the two surfaces are
allowed to differ. Without loss of generality we assume (i)
the carrier number density and hence the Fermi energy
is the same in each layer and (ii) sidewall states do not
participate in transport, an assumption that recent work
has shown to be justified [81]. The chemical potential lies
in the surface conduction band of each layer. We require
εFτl/ (cid:29) 1 in each layer l ∈ {a ≡ active, p ≡ passive},
with εF the Fermi energy located in the surface conduc-
tion bands and τl the momentum scattering time. The
two-layer effective band Hamiltonian

where the (Rashba) Hamiltonian of a single layer hk =
A σ·(k× z) ≡ −Akσ· θ with θ the tangential unit vector
corresponding to k. The Pauli matrix τz represents the
layer degree of freedom. The eigenvalues of Eq. (1) are
k , the band index sk = ±
with + the conduction band and − the valence band.

We directly calculate the anomalous Hall drag resistiv-
ity ρyx
D : the procedure will be outlined below. We find
jlh and jhh (Fig. 1) vanish identically, implying that the
anomalous Hall current in the active layer does not gen-
erate a corresponding drag current in the passive layer.
The physics can be understood in two steps. Firstly, an
external electric field drives the electrons in the active
layer longitudinally, and these in turn exert a longitudi-
nal drag force on the passive-layer electrons. The drag
force acts as an effective longitudinal driving term for the
passive-layer electrons. The anomalous Hall component
of the drag current, which at low temperatures can be
sizeable compared to the longitudinal component, repre-
sents the transverse response of the passive layer to this
effective longitudinal driving force, and depends on the
passive-layer magnetization Mp. The electric field also
generates an anomalous Hall current in the active layer.
This response is dominated by topological terms of the
order of the conductivity quantum, which represents a
re-arrangement of charge carriers among spin-momentum
locked energy states. Physically this is because Coulomb
drag occurs as a result of the interaction between the
charge densities in different layers, whereas the anoma-
lous Hall current flowing in the active layer is not as-
sociated with a change in the charge density:
it does
not arise from a shift in the Fermi surface, but from the
Berry phase acquired through the rearrangement of car-
riers among spin-momentum locked states. This implies
that the anomalous Hall drag current is quite generally
independent of the active-layer magnetization Ma. This
can be easily verified experimentally. The corollary is
that in a sample in which the active layer is undoped,
so that it produces no longitudinal current but only a

quantized anomalous Hall current, there will be no drag
current at all in the passive layer.

We analyse the parameter dependence of ρyx

D in Fig. 2
and Fig. 3. The relationship between ρyx
D and the magne-
tization of the passive layer is illustrated in Fig. 2. There
is an upward trend at small magnetizations followed by a
relatively slow decrease at larger values of Mp. The trend
can be understood as follows. For Mp (cid:28) AkF one may
expand Eq. (10) in Mp, which reveals that the current
increases nearly linearly with Mp. In the opposite limit
in which Mp (cid:29) AkF [82], the anomalous Hall current
vanishes, since the effect of spin-orbit coupling (chiral-
ity), which scales with kF, becomes negligible.
In fact
at large Mp one may expand the band energies in Ak,
with the leading k-dependent term scaling as k2, which
suggests the system in this limit behaves as a regular,
non-magnetic 2DEG. This explains the slow downward
trend with increasing Mp, and hence the presence of the
peak as a function of Mp. At larger electron densities the
peak occurs at stronger values of the magnetization, since
higher electron densities imply higher values of AkF, in-
creasing the effect of chirality at the expense of the mag-
netization. We note that magnetizations of magnetic TIs
have been measured by superconducting quantum inter-
ference device (SQUID) magnetometers [12, 83]. Because
the momentum scattering time is in principle known from
the longitudinal conductivity of each layer [84, 85], the
trend exhibited by ρyx
D as a function of the magnetization
Mp can be verified experimentally.

drag resistivity on additional experimentally measurable

dence, yet no topological contribution. Next, Fig. 3(b)
illustrates the temperature dependence of ρyx
D for sepa-
rations d = 10, 20, 40 nm. We find that, much like ρxx
D ,
ρyx
D also increases nearly quadratically with temperature.
The T 2 dependence stems from the allowed phase space
for electron-electron scattering at low temperature, and
is expected for any interaction strength between the top
and bottom layers of TIs, provided the carriers can be
described using a Fermi liquid picture. Moreover, due to
the absence of backscattering in TIs there is no correction
logarithmic in temperature. Fig. 3(c) presents the layer
separation dependence of ρyx
D for three different Fermi
wave vectors kF = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6nm−1.

Experimentally, for TI films in the large-surface limit,
non-topological contributions from the bulk and the side
surface are negligible [88], and we expect the effects
described in this work to be observable. Aside from
commonly used materials such as Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, a

small-gap three-dimensional TI has also been identified
in strained HgTe. The TI surface states in this mate-
rial are, however, spatially extended and could be peaked
quite far from the wide quantum well edges, reducing the
effective 2D layer separation [81].

Massive Dirac fermions are also found in graphene with
a staggered sublattice potential, and MoS2 thin films
where inversion symmetry is broken. The band Hamil-
tonian for a single layer is given by H (l)
0k = at(τ kxσx +
2 σz with τ = ±1 the valley index, where a is
kyσy) + ∆
the lattice constant, t is the effective hopping integral,
and ∆ is the energy gap. These Dresselhaus-like Hamil-
tonians can be directly mapped onto the Rashba Hamil-
tonian considered in this work [89]. The longitudinal
drag current is identical for both TIs and other massive
Dirac fermion systems, because the physical mechanism
behind the longitudinal drag phenomenon is a result of
rectification by the passive layer of the fluctuating elec-
tric field generated by the active layer. However, when
inversion symmetry is broken in a 2D hexagonal lattice,
a pair of valleys which are time-reversal of each other
are distinguishable by their opposite values of magnetic
moment and Berry curvature. Therefore, there will be
no transverse drag current in graphene or MoS2 with
broken inversion symmetry because the Berry curvatures
have opposite signs in the opposite valleys. In a Dirac
semimetal, each Dirac point is four-fold degenerate and
can be viewed as consisting of two Weyl nodes with op-
posite chiralities. Consequently, transverse drag currents
also vanish in Dirac semimetals. At small magnetizations
the longitudinal drag currents in these materials will be
independent of the magnetizations of either layer.

The results are also applicable to Rashba 2DEGs,
though measuring a strong anomalous Hall effect [90]
can be challenging. A sizable fraction of the conductivity
quantum is obtained if the two Rashba sub-bands expe-
rience a large magnetization splitting and εF lies in the
bottom sub-band, but that is challenging experimentally.
When εF (cid:29) M the effect vanishes altogether.

We have studied Coulomb drag of massive Dirac
fermions, finding that the drag due to the topological
terms on the active surface vanishes and the only contri-
bution to anomalous Hall drag comes from the anomalous
Hall current generated by the longitudinal drag force ex-
perienced by the passive layer. In a system in which the
active layer is undoped and only a quantized anomalous
Hall effect exists in the active layer there is no drag cur-
rent at all. In a doped system the transverse drag current
has a non-monotonic dependence on the magnetization of
the passive layer, with a peak at a value of the magneti-
zation that becomes pronounced at lower densities.

[91] Although magnetic impurities also cause spin-dependent
scattering, our recent work showed that the anomalous
Hall effect in TIs is dominated by the band structure
spin-orbit coupling [28], hence we do not include explic-
itly spin-dependent scattering due to the magnetic impu-
rities.
