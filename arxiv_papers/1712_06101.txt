Recently, we have revealed an intrinsic instability of metals due to surface plasma waves (SPWs) and raised
the prospect of using it to create lossless SPWs. The counter-intuitive nature of this finding prompts one to ask,
why had not this instability been disclosed before, given the long history of this subject? If this instability does
exist, how far is it from reality? The present work is devoted to answering these questions. To this end, we derive
a unified macroscopic theory of SPWs that applies to any type of electron dynamics, be they local or non-local,
classical or quantum-mechanical. In light of this theory, we analyze the behaviors of SPWs according to several
electron dynamics models, including the widely used local dielectric model (DM), the hydrodynamic model
(HDM) and the specular reflection model (SRM), in addition to the less common semi-classical model (SCM).
We find that, in order to unveil the instability, one must (i) self-consistently treat surface effects without any
of the usually imposed auxiliary conditions and (ii) include translation symmetry breaking effects in electron
dynamics. As far as we are concerned, none existing work had fulfilled both (i) and (ii). To assess the possibility
of realizing the instability, we analyze two very important factors: the dielectric interfacing the metal and inter-
band transitions, which both were ignored in our recent work. Whereas inter-band absorption  --  together with
Landau damping  --  is shown adverse to the instability, a dielectric brings it closer to occurrence. One may even
attain it in common plasmonic materials such as silver under not so tough conditions.

INTRODUCTION

Electron density ripples propagating along metal surfaces,
known as surface plasma waves (SPWs), have been inten-
sively pursued as a promising enabler of nano photonics1 -- 4.
A fundamental issue hampering further progress is concerned
with energy losses5. SPWs lose energy fast due to Joule heat-
ing, Landau damping and inter-band absorption alongside oth-
ers such as radiation losses5. It has been suggested that these
losses  --  especially those due to Landau damping  --  are intrin-
sic and cannot be significantly reduced without the addition of
external gain medium5 -- 9. They would ultimately handicap the
functionalities of SPWs5,6.

Our recent work10 -- 12 challenged the above view and found
that, thanks to an incipient instability, the losses may well be
reduced to any level without taking energy from outside. A
critical point was shown to exist at γ0τ = 1, where τ−1 is the
thermal electronic collision rate and γ0 is a positive-definite
quantity. At the critical point, the energy released from the
Fermi sea  --  at rate γ0  --  just compensates for the dissipation
due to electronic collisions and SPWs become lossless12. This
instability was revealed through a semi-classical model (SCM,
based on Boltzmann's transport equation) of SPWs. Given the
highly counter-intuitive nature of this possibility and the long
history on this subject dated back to late 1950s13, the follow-
ing questions must then be answered: Why has the criticality
not been discovered in earlier work and what is missing in
those work? While it is not widely used in the study of SPWs,
the SCM had certainly been considered before14,15. Yet no-
body had claimed lossless SPWs.

The main purpose of the present paper is to answer the
above question. Our strategy is to construct a universal theory
of SPWs that is applicable to any type of electron dynamics,
be they local or non-local, classical or quantum-mechanical.
In light of this theory, the properties of SPWs are then an-
alyzed with several common electron dynamics models, in-
cluding the local dielectric model (DM)13, the classical hydro-
dynamic model (HDM)16 -- 19 and the specular reflection model

(SRM)20 -- 22 in addition to the SCM. The chief result obtained
through this analysis is that, in order to unveil the instabil-
ity, (i) a SPW theory must self-consistently deal with physical
surfaces, and (ii) translation symmetry breaking effects must
be included in the electron dynamics. Amongst these mod-
els, only the SCM is capable of (ii), but previous work based
on the SCM had all failed with respect to (i). This explains
why the existing work had failed to hit upon the possibility of
lossless SPWs.

In existing work based on non-local models, auxiliary con-
ditions have usually been imposed23 -- 26, mostly assuming no
normal current on surfaces, as in the hard-wall picture adopted
in computational studies27 -- 30. From a conceptual point of
view, however, these conditions are obviously incompatible
with local models and arise only due to an incomplete de-
scription of physical surfaces31. We will show that the con-
ventional treatment of SPWs via auxiliary conditions does not
recover the standard textbook SPWs in the local models. We
prescribe a simple yet complete macroscopic description of
physical surfaces, which remedies the conceptual deficiency
and allows to derive a universal SPW theory accounting for
surface effects self-consistently.

As a secondary purpose, we wish to address an experimen-
tally interesting issue, that is, how far is the instability from re-
ality and how can it be achieved? In general, τ−1 is compara-
ble to the characteristic plasma frequency ωp, even in defect-
free materials and at zero temperature32. This is because τ−1
is the collision rate at the SPW frequency, which is in the or-
der of a few eVs in metals and thus effects as an effective
high temperature of tens of thousands of Kelvins opening up
a large phase volume for electron scattering. One then expects
γ0τ < 1 usually. In order to devise a practically useful method
of enhancing γ0, we employ our theory to analyze two impor-
tant factors affecting γ0: a dielectric interfacing the metal sup-
porting SPWs and inter-band transition effects, which were
ignored in Refs.10 -- 12. We find that, inter-band absorption (as
well as Landau damping) strongly reduces γ0, whereas top-
ping a dielectric can significantly increase γ0. In this way the

A. Macroscopic description of surfaces

The SIM under consideration is assumed to occupy the re-
gion z ≥ 0 and bounded by a flat interface/surface macroscop-
ically located at z = 0. The other half space is either the vac-
uum or a dielectric with dielectric constant ǫd, see Fig. 1. We
shall use the vector x = (r, z) to denote a point in space, where
r = (x, y) is the planar projection of x. Further, x0 = (r, 0)
denotes a point on the surface and t denotes time.

In a macroscopic description of SPWs, one usually consid-
ers the metal as a medium for an electromagnetic field and
seeks surface localized (polariton) solutions of the governing
Maxwell's equations33. The procedure is to write down the
waves for (an infinite metal) on the metal side and those (for
an infinite dielectric) on the dielectric side, and then invoke
conditions to match those waves at the surface. With local dy-
namics, the usual Maxwell's boundary conditions would do
the job. With non-local dynamics, however, they are insuf-
ficient. Historically, auxiliary conditions  --  mostly assuming
zero normal current at the surface14,15,17,25  --  have been in-
vented as a remedy since 1950s23, which however treat the
symptoms not the cause. The cause is a conceptual deficiency
in the knowledge of surfaces31. Considering that a real mi-
croscopic surface can hardly be specified even for the sim-
plest material due to preparation procedures, one might deem
it hopeless to have a complete description. The following ele-
mentary analysis suggests otherwise.

Let us imagine bringing two materials (A and B) in con-
tact, and an interfacial layer of thickness ds  --  in the order
of a few lattice constants  --  shall form in between. We may
characterize this layer by a surface potential φs, which should
quickly decay to zero in the bulk regions outside the interfacial
layer. The exact microscopic profile of the layer varies from
one case to another and can hardly be known a priori. De-
spite this, we may still write down a generic form for the elec-
tric current density j(x, t) in the whole system including the
interfacial layer. To this end, we observe that in the bulk re-
gions where φs vanishes, the form of j(x, t) can be completely
specified with the respective dynamic equations for the infi-
nite materials, apart from some parameters (such as the Fuchs
parameter, see Sec. V) that encode the effects of surface scat-
tering on the electron waves. Let us denote by JA/B(x, t) the
forms of j(x, t) in the bulk region of A/B. Microscopically, j
evolves from JA in the bulk region of A, through a rapid vari-
ation in the interfacial layer, to JB in the bulk region of B.
Formally, we can write for the µ-th component of the current
density that jµ(x, t) = JA,µ(x, t)wµ(z) + JB,µ(x, t)(1 − wα(z)),
where the profile functions wα(z) approach unity in the bulk
region of A and zero in that of B. The exact profile of wµ(z)
depends on the microscopic details of the interfacial layer.
On the scale of λ, however, the interfacial layer appears in-
finitely thin and wα(z) reduce to the Heaviside step function
Θ(z), where Θ(z ≥ 0) = 1 and Θ(z < 0) = 0, in a macroscopic
theory. One thus ends up with

j(x, t) = JA(x, t)Θ(z) + JB(x, t)(1 − Θ(z)).

(1)

This holds valid for any wµ(z) and is thus a general and com-
plete macroscopic description of a physical interface, as long

instability may well be in reach in a single crystal of silver.

This paper is organized as follows. We develop a univer-
sal macroscopic SPW theory in the next section and apply it
to the DM, the HDM and the SRM in Sec IV. Section III in-
cludes a discussion of a phenomenological approach to inter-
band transition effects to make the paper self-contained. Sec-
tion V is devoted to a thorough treatment of SPWs within the
SCM. Dielectric and inter-band effects are analyzed. We as-
sess the possibility of creating lossless SPWs by the SCM and
conclude the paper in Sec. VII. In Appendices A and B, we
discuss some historical misconceptions regarding the SPWs
in the HDM and the SRM, respectively.

II. UNIVERSAL THEORY OF SPWS

In this section, we present a general theory of charge den-
sity waves in semi-infinite metals (SIMs). Extension to sys-
tems of other geometries is straightforward and will be con-
sidered elsewhere. The theory is formulated in terms of uni-
versal physical concepts and makes no resort to the particulars
of electron dynamics. It is a macroscopic theory, thus valid as
long as the thickness (ds, typically a few lattice constants) of
the microscopic surface layer, which forms between the vac-
uum and the bulk metal, is much smaller than the SPW wave-
length Λ. In this paper, by 'macroscopic' we always mean
ds/Λ ≪ 1, with no regard to electron dynamics.

Retardation effects are neglected throughout this paper,
which is reasonable provided the SPW phase velocity is much
less than the speed of light in vacuum.

as a perturbation on one side does not cause significant re-
sponses on the other.

To recapitulate, equation (1) elegantly captures two impor-
tance physical consequences of an interface: the rapid varia-
tion of the current density through the step function Θ(z) and
the surface scattering effects on electron dynamics through the
parameters contained in the bulk forms. These scattering ef-
fects  --  including the symmetry breaking effects  --  have been
ignored in most models except for the SCM. In general JA and
JB are not equal on the interface, as is certainly the case for
local dynamics models, and charges accumulate in the interfa-
cial layer. Such capacitive effects would be mistakenly erased
under auxiliary conditions, which often dictate continuity of
current across the interface, e.g. the vanishing of normal cur-
rent at the metal-vacuum interface.

B. Charge density waves

Now we derive the equations of motion for the charge
density ρ(x, t) in the SIM. Our starting point is the equa-
tion of continuity. Specifying Eq. (1) to the SIM, we have
j(x, t) = Θ(z)J(x, t), where J(x, t) is the current density in the
metal. The equation of continuity then reads

3

For linear responses, J(z) can be related to E(z) as follows

Jµ(z) = Xµ,ν=x,y,zZ dz′σµν(z, z′, ω)Eν(z′),

(5)

where σµν(z, z′, ω) is the conductivity tensor. Considering that
E(z) linearly depends on ρ(z), we can define a linear operator

H with kernel H (z, z′) so that

H ρ(z) = Z dz′H (z, z′)ρ(z′) = −i ¯ω∇ · J(z).

(6)

It is easy to show that

dz′′∇µσµν(z, z′′, ω)∇′′ν Vk(z′′ − z′),

H (z, z′) = i ¯ωXµν Z ∞
where ∇′′ = (ik, ∂z′′) and Vk(z) is the k-th Fourier component
of the Coulomb interaction V(x) = 1/x. Now Eq. (3) can be
transformed into

0

(cid:16) H − ¯ω2(cid:17) ρ(z) = S Θ′(z),

S = i ¯ωJz(0).

(7)

Note that S does not depend on z. Since ρ(z) is defined only
for z ≥ 0, we can introduce a cosine Fourier transform

Dtρ(x, t) + ∂x · j(x, t) = 0, Dt = τ−1 + ∂t.

ρ(z) =

π Z ∞

0

dq ρq cos(qz).

Here we have included a global relaxation term −ρ(x, t)/τ to
account for the thermal relaxation of non-equilibrium charges
due to microscopic electronic collisions driving the system
toward thermodynamic equilibrium. In terms of J(x, t), this
equation becomes

In terms of ρq, Eq. (7) can be rewritten as

dq′(cid:16)H (q, q′) − ¯ω2δ(q − q′)(cid:17) ρq′ = S .

(8)

Dtρ(x, t) + ∂x · J(x, t) = −Θ′(z)Jz(x0, t),

Here

where Θ′(z) = ∂zΘ(z). The right-hand term of this equation
signifies the capacitive effects, which is critical in the energy
conversion process but had been overlooked until our recent
work12. This term was also noticed by A. L. Fetter in studying
the edge plasmon in two-dimension systems19.

Without loss of generality, we may assume a quasi-plane
wave for the fields and write ρ(x, t) = ρ(z)ei(k·r−ωt) and simi-
larly for J(x, t) and the electric field E(x, t), where the wave
vector k = (k ≥ 0, 0) is directed along the positive x-axis for
the sake of definiteness. In general the frequency ω = ωs − iγ
is complex. The relation between ω and k is determined by
the wave equations to be established in what follows. Equa-
tion (2) thus becomes

H (q, q′) =

functionals of ρq. We can thus write

write ¯ω = ωs + iγ0, so that

As a key result of this paper, Eqs. (8) and (9) constitute a
complete description of self-sustained charge density waves
in SIMs. Their basic structures are valid regardless of the un-
derlying electron dynamics encoded in H and G.

γ = 1/τ − γ0

C. Universal secular equation for SPWs

by definition. We shall see that γ0 is negative in all models
except for the SCM, in which it is positive-definite thanks to
a fundamental physical reason.

Equation (8) is an inhomogeneous linear equation with a
source term. Equations of this type generally admit of two

classes of solutions, depending on whether S vanishes or not.
Solutions with S = 0 represent nothing but the bulk plasma
waves, while those with S , 0 represent localized waves, i.e.
SPWs in our system. The spectra of these two classes gen-
erally do not overlap. Had we imposed auxiliary boundary
conditions as is usually done in the literature, SPWs would
not exist at all.

To find the 'secular' equation for SPWs, we wish to make a
simplification, which is not necessary but will make the result-
ing expressions more transparent. To this end, let us look at
some general properties of σµν(z, z′, ω). For an infinite system
without boundaries, the translational symmetry is preserved
along z-axis as well as along the surface plane, in which case
σµν only depends on z − z′. For SIMs, however, that sym-
metry is broken and σµν must in general depend on z and z′
separately. It shall prove useful to decompose σµν into two
parts, σb,µν and σs,µν, where σb,µν is defined to be that of the
infinite system and depends only on z− z′ while σs,µν signifies
pure surface effects. Namely,

σµν(z, z′, ω) = σb,µν(z − z′, ω) + σs,µν(z, z′, ω).

Accordingly, H and G also each contain two parts arising
from σb,µν and σs,µν, respectively. Let us then write H =
Hb + Hs. Now that it reflects on the properties of plasma
waves of an infinite system, Hb must be diagonal in the q-
space, i.e. Hb(q, q′) = Ω2(K, ω)δ(q − q′), where Ω(K, ω) is
a frequency that only depends on K. By definition, one can
easily show that the dielectric function of an infinite system is
given by

ǫ(K, ω) = 1 −

Ω2(K, ω)

¯ω2

.

(10)

As for Hs, it gives rise to scattering of plasma waves. Never-
theless, for bulk waves the scattering due to a surface should
be insignificant and may be treated perturbatively, as we did
in Refs.10,11. To the lowest order in this perturbation, we may
simply put

H (q, q′) = Ω2(K, ω)δ(q − q′).

(11)

This expression contains complete information of bulk plasma
waves. As expected, the zeros of ǫ(K, ω) give the dispersion
ǫb(K) of these waves.

We analogously write G = Gb + Gs. Note that via Eq. (9)
Gb determines Jz at the point z = 0 in a infinite system, for
which, however this point is none more special than any other
points. Thus, Gb can only be a constant that does not de-
pend on q and it is therefore purely due to the local part of
σb,µν(z − z′). This part must be isotropic for the jellium model
and it can be written as δµνδ(z− z′)σ(ω), where δµν is the Kro-
neckle symbol and σ(ω) is to be discussed further. It follows
that Gb = −4i ¯ωσ(ω)kβ, where we have taken into account
the effect of the dielectric via the factor β = 2ǫd/(1 + ǫd); see
details below. We now obtain

G(K, ω) = −4i ¯ωσ(ω)kβ + Gs(K, ω).

(12)

We see that Gs describes translation symmetry breaking ef-
fects. As to be seen later, it is missing from the DM, the HDM

4

and the SRM. The positive-definiteness of γ0 arises solely
through this term and therefore cannot be captured in these
models.

For SPWs, S , 0. Inserting Eq. (11) in (8) and using (9),

we find

ǫs(k, ω) = 1 −Z ∞

G(K, ω)

Ω2(K, ω) − ¯ω2

which determines the SPW frequency ωs and damping rate γ

SPW charge density is obtained as

ρq =

ǫ(K, ω)! .

(14)

The resulting ρ(z) is peaked about the surface.

Equations (13) and (14) constitute a universal description of
SPWs. They are valid irrespective of the underlying electron
dynamics, which enter only through ǫ(K, ω) and G(K, ω).

D. Dielectric effects

Let us place a dielectric with dielectric constant ǫd  --  which
can be complex  --  on the side z < 0. The electrostatic fields
are affected by this dielectric, which can be calculated with
the method of mirror charges. Let the mirror charge density
in the dielectric be ρd(x, t) = ρd(z)ei(k·r−ωt). It is easy to show
that34

ρd(z < 0) = −

ǫd − 1
ǫd + 1

ρ(−z).

(15)

The electrostatic potential φ(x, t) = φ(z)ei(k·r−ωt), obeying
Poisson's equation ∂2
xφ(x, t) + 4π(ρ(x, t) + ρd(x, t)) = 0, is then
obtained as

φ(z) =

2π

k Z ∞

−∞

dz′ e−kz−z′(cid:16)ρ(z′) + ρd(z′)(cid:17) .

(16)

In the metal, where z ≥ 0, the electric field E(z) = −∇φ(z) =
(E x(z), 0, Ez(z)) then follows as

E x(z) = −iZ ∞

(18)

where β has been given in the above. See that Ez(0) and hence
Gb are enhanced by the factor β, which is why this factor ap-
pears in Eq. (12). Physically this is because the surface sits
between the charges in the metal and those in the dielectric
and spatially separates them.

INTER-BAND TRANSITION EFFECTS

yielding σ(ω) = σDM(ω) + σp(ω). From Eq. (6) one finds Ω2
dispersionless, given as

5

The dynamics models to be considered in the next two sec-
tions only describe the currents from electrons in the conduc-
tion band. Realistically, valence electrons can also contribute
by virtual inter-band transitions. In this paper, for the sake
of simplicity, we account for these inter-band transition ef-
fects by a phenomenological approach35 -- 37. The observation
is that, valence electrons are usually tightly held to their host
atoms and the energy bands are largely non-dispersion, and
thus their electrical responses are mostly local and not sus-
ceptible to the presence of boundaries. We may then describe
this response by a local conductivity function σp(ω), so that
the electrical current density due to the valence electrons is
given by

Ω2

0(ω) = ω2

p − ¯ω2ǫp(ω)

Bulk plasma waves. Equating Ω2

0 with ¯ω2 yields the fre-
quency ωb,DM and damping rate γb,DM for bulk plasma waves.
For ωpτ → ∞ and assuming ǫp(ω) independent of ω, they are
given by

ωb,DM =

ωp

p1 + ǫpr

,

γb,DM/ωb,DM =

1

ωb,DMτ

+

2

ǫpi

1 + ǫpr

.

Note that bulk waves bear no dielectric effects, i.e. no depen-
dence on ǫd. The damping rate γb,DM arises due to thermal
collisions and inter-band absorption.

Jp(z) = σp(ω)E(z).

(19)

Gs = 0. As such, G(K, ω) becomes

SPWs. The electrical conductivity is purely local and thus

Usually σp(ω) may be modeled in the Lorentz form.
It
is related to the inter-band dielectric function by ǫp(ω) =
4πiσp(ω)/ ¯ω, which can be measured for example by means of
ellipsometry or computed by density functional theory. ǫp(ω)
contains a real part ǫpr(ω) and an imaginary part ǫpi(ω). While
ǫpr(ω) acts to shield the conduction electrons, ǫpi(ω)  --  which
is always positive  --  leads to inter-band absorption. Being ba-
sically an atomic property, ǫp is not sensitive to temperature.

IV. SPWS IN DM, HDM AND SRM

While the theory established in Sec. II is universal, the be-
haviors of SPWs do depend on electron dynamics through
ǫ(K, ω) and G(K, ω).
In this section, we apply the theory
to examine SPWs within several common electron dynamics
models: the DM, the HDM and the SRM. SPWs in the SCM
will be thoroughly treated in the next section. We show that
the usually quoted SPW solution in the HDM is false and clar-
ify the origin of SPWs in the SRM. A summary of this analysis
is tabulated in Table I

A. Local dielectric model (DM)

This is the standard model for SPWs. Unlike other mod-
els, it does not require and is incompatible with any auxiliary
conditions. Here we reproduce by our theory the well-known
properties of SPWs in this model.

According to the DM, the current density due to conduction

electrons is given by

JDM(z) = σDM(ω)E(z), σDM(ω) =

ω2
p
4π

i

¯ω

,

(20)

where ωp = p4πn0e2/m is the characteristic plasma fre-

quency of the metal with m and e being the effective mass and
charge of an electron, respectively. The total current density
J(z) then is

Jp(z) + JDM(z) = (σDM(ω) + σp(ω))E(z),

G0 = (kβ/π)Ω2

0(ω).

Substituting this into Eq. (13), we immediately arrive at the of-
ten quoted frequency ωs,DM and damping rate γs,DM for SPWs.
Neglecting absorption in the dielectric, i.e. assuming real ǫd,
we find

ωs,DM =

ωp

p1 + ǫd + ǫpr

,

γs,DM
ωs,DM

=

1

ωs,DMτ

+

ǫpi

1 + ǫd + ǫpr

.

In this model, the SPW charge density is completely localized
on the surface, ρ(z) = ρsΘ′(z), where ρs = S /(Ω2
0 − ¯ω2) gives
the areal charge density. See that the dielectric tends to reduce
the SPW damping rate.

Traditionally38, the above results have been obtained by
treating the metal as a simple dielectric with dielectric con-
0/ ¯ω2. Then exponentially decaying electro-
stant ǫ(ω) = 1− Ω2
magnetic (EM) waves (or electrostatic potentials in the quasi-
static limit) are written down on the metal and the dielectric
sides, and Maxwell's boundary conditions are used to match
the waves to obtain the above frequency and damping rate of
SPWs. Our theory works directly with charge density rather
than EM waves. The two approaches are equivalent.

B. Hydrodynamic model (HDM)

The DM assumes a purely local relation between the cur-
rent density and the electric field. The HDM extends the DM
by inclusion of leading-order non-local corrections. Recently,
this model has attracted lots of attention in plasmonics and
quantum forces39,40. It has also been synergized with density
functional theory in the quantum hydrodynamic model41 -- 44 to
study local plasmon resonances on metal particles.

In the HDM, Ω2 includes leading-order dependence on K

and is given by

Ω2

HDM = Ω2

0 + K2v2
0,

where v0 is a parameter. The dielectric function45 then reads
ǫHDM = 1 − Ω2
HDM/ ¯ω2. The bulk waves are similar to those in
the DM except for some dispersion with K.

tric function of the infinite system, whose zeros give the dispersion of bulk plasma waves. SPWs are determined by this secular equation:
ǫs = 1 + R ∞
= 0. The solution to this equation is written as ω = ωs − iγ. In the SCM, an extra contribution γs arises due to
symmetry breaking effects contained in Gs. Very interestingly, γ0 = γs − γLandau − γinterband cannot be negative.

wave spectra gratifying ǫHDM = 0. For v0 = 0, the HDM
reduces to the DM and so do the SPWs, as expected. With

where we have used the fact that ǫHDM is even in q and that
p/ ¯ω2 ≈ 2 for the solutions to this equation. As shown in
ω2
Appendix A, it leads to a linear dispersion of ωs versus k.
As in the DM, the SPW damps due to thermal collisions and
inter-band absorption, at rate γs,HDM ≈ γs,DM apart from some
dispersion effects.
In the literature, the condition that Jz(0) = 0 is usually im-
posed in the HDM15,17. This would mean S = 0 and therefore
would exclude any SPWs according to our theory. Neverthe-
less, SPWs have been claimed to exist under this condition.
In what follows we briefly show that this claim is false, more
details to be found in Appendix A.

For illustration, we take ǫp = 0 and ǫd = 0. Impose S =

p + v2

equivalently in the real space

HDM − ¯ω2(cid:17) ρq = 0, or
0 and the wave equation becomes (cid:16)Ω2
z(cid:17) ρ(z) = 0.

The claimed SPW solution is then sought of the form ρ(z) =
ρ0e−κz. Substituting this in the equation leads to ¯ω2 = ω2

0(k2 − κ2).
v2
Imposing Jz(0) = 0 gives another relation,
ω2
0 = v2
0κ(k + κ), which expresses the balance between the
electronic pressure and the electric force at the surface. Here
ω0 = ωp/ √2. Those two relations specify the solution. Com-
bined, they lead to ¯ω2 ≈ ω2
0 + ω0βk. Nevertheless, this solu-
tion does not reduce in the limit v0 = 0 to the SPWs found by

(23)

Ritchie with the DM. Actually, κ diverges in this limit, yield-

ing R ρ(z)dz ∼ κ−1 = 0, i.e. the solution is empty of charges.

This false solution is also what was observed in Refs.14,15,47.
It is plausible that existing ab initio calculations have only ob-
served this false solution as well28. A comprehensive account
may merit a future study.

Although the false solution and the correct solution are con-
ceptually disparate, their dispersion relations are quite similar,
as shown in Appendix A.

C. Specular reflection model (SRM)

A natural step to go beyond the HDM is to use the full form
of Ω rather than the approximation ΩHDM. Equation (22) then
becomes

= 0.

(24)

This is exactly the equation established by Marusak and
Ritchie in 1966 for the SRM20. Our derivation makes it clear
that the SRM is just an extension of the HDM. From this point
of view, one may also conclude that the usually claimed SPWs
in the HDM are false, because they are not solutions of Eq. 24
in the HDM limit.

In contrast with the DM and the HDM, SPWs in the SRM
can also decay via Landau damping, because of an imaginary
part in Ω associated with electron-hole excitations. Thus, the
SPW damping rate is γs,SRM ≈ γs,DM + γLandau, see the next
section for further discussion on this.
We wish to point out a logical inconsistency in the original
contrivance of the SRM. There are two elements in this con-
trivance: (i) as nominally expected, electron waves impinging
on the surface are assumed to be specularly reflected back,
and (ii) a sheet of 'fictitious' charges exactly localized on the
surface. Element (i) would mean Jz(0) = 0 and hence, by
our theory, no SPWs would materialize. Then how do those
waves come about? The answer rests with element (ii). In Ap-
pendix B, we show that the fictitious charge sheet reinstates
the capacitive effects lost under element (i). Actually, SPWs
appear as a pole of this fictitious charge density.

As with the HDM and the DM, the SRM contains no sym-
metry breaking effects, i.e. Gs is absent from these models.
To account for these effects, further improvement is required,
leading to the SCM.

V. SPWS IN THE SCM

In the SCM one calculates the electric currents in terms of
a distribution function f (x, v, t) defined in the single-particle
phase space. As usual, we write it as a sum of the equi-
librium part f0(ε(v)) and the non-equilibrium part g(x, v, t).
f0(ε) is taken to be the Fermi-Dirac function at zero tempera-
ture. ε(v) = mv2/2 is the dispersion of the conduction band.
Within the relaxation time approximation and the regime of
linear responses, g(x, v, t) = g(v, z)ei(k·r−ωt) satisfies the fol-
lowing Boltzmann's equation

(cid:16)λ−1 + ∂z(cid:17) g(v, z) + e f ′0 (ε)v · E(z)/vz = 0.

(25)

Here λ = ivz/ ω with ω = ¯ω − kvx and f ′0
(2/m)δ(v2 − v2
vF the Fermi velocity.

= ∂ε f0(ε) =
F ), where m is the electron effective mass and

Physical causality10 requires that γ0 = Im( ¯ω) ≥ 0; oth-
erwise, reflected electron waves would come before incident
waves. Together with Eq. (4), we may conclude that the SPW
damping rate is always in short of τ−1, i.e. γτ < 1, in non-
reconcilable contrast with other models.

With γ0 ≥ 0, the general solution to Eq. (25) can be written

as

This condition is identical with the condition used in Ref.12
but differs from that in Refs.10,11 except for p = 0. It follows

Equations (26) - (30) fully specify the distribution function for
the electrons.

The electrical current density due to the conduction elec-

trons is then calculated as

Jc(z) = (m/2π)3Z d3v evg(v, z).

(31)

Note that the charge density is not given by

ρ(x, t) = (m/2π)3 ei(kx−ωt)Z d3v eg(v, z).

The reason is simple: the as-obtained g(v, z) is for the bulk
region and not valid on the surface, because Eq. (3.1) in-
volves no surface potentials, see Sec. II A. Actually, Jc(x, t)
and ρ(x, t) obey the equation

(∂t + 1/τ) ρ(x, t) + ∂x · Jc(x, t) = 0

rather than the equation of continuity [c.f. Eq. (2)], automat-
ically embodying the condition that Jz(0) = 0. This underlies
the incorrect conclusion drawn by Harris and others14.

To determine C(v) for vz > 0, the boundary condition at z = 0
has to be used, which, whoever, depends on surface proper-
ties. We adopt a simple picture first conceived by Fuchs48
and then widely used in the study of for instance anomalous
skin effect49 -- 52. According to this picture a fraction p i.e. the
Fuchs parameter varying between zero and unity, of the elec-
trons impinging on the surface are specularly reflected back,
i.e.

g(v, z = 0) = p g(v−, z = 0),

v− = (vx, vy, −vz),

vz ≥ 0.
(29)

We substitute the expression of E(z) given by Eqs. (17) and
(18) into (26) - (30) and perform the integration over z′. We
find it instructive to split g(v, z) into two parts, one denoted by
gb(v, z) and the other by gs(v, z). They are given by

One may show that gb(v, z) can also be obtained directly by
Boltzmann's equation for an infinite system. Thus, this part

(35)

4ρq

contains exactly the responses of an infinite system. It is inde-
pendent of surface properties, i.e. showing no dependence on
the Fuchs parameter p, and the electrons incident on the sur-
face (i.e. with vz < 0) and those departing it (i.e. with vz > 0)
appear on equal footing in its expression.

On the other hand, gs(v, z) signifies pure surface effects: it
exists only for departing electrons, as indicated by the Heavi-
side function Θ(vz) in its expression, and it depends on p thus
reflecting on surface roughness. If we keep only gb(v, z), the
SRM will be revisited, making it evident that the SRM does
not correspond to the limit of p = 1 (specularly reflecting sur-
face), in contrast with its nominal meaning.

Another important feature of gs(v, z) lies in its dependence
on z, i.e. gs(v, z) ∝ ei ωz/vz ∝ e−γ0z/vz, which implies that γ0 ≥ 0
in accord with causality [see also preceding remarks above Eq.
(26)]. Otherwise, it would diverge far away from the surface.

B. Ω and G in the SCM

The conduction current density is also written in two parts,
Jc(z) = Jb(z) + Js(z), where Jb/s(z) are defined via Eq. (31)
with g(v, z) replaced by gb/s(v, z). For small kvF / ¯ω, we may
keep only the first term in the series of F0(k, ¯ω, v). It is then
straightforward to show that

Jb(z) = σDM(ω)E(z) + JSRM(z),

(36)

where JSRM(z) is responsible for the extension made through
the SRM beyond the DM. It is given by53

JSRM,x(z) = Z DqD3v vxF′+(K, ¯ω, v) cos(qz),
JSRM,z(z) = i Z DqD3v vzF′
−(K, ¯ω, v) sin(qz),

See that JSRM,z(0) ≡ 0, which makes no contribution to G.

Here P takes the principal value. The sign of the second line
depends on the sign of γ0. Only for γ0 > 0, it is negative lead-
ing to damping, in line with causality. Equation (42) shows
that, for bulk waves Landau damping exists only for suffi-
ciently large K. For SPWs, however, Landau damping always
exists, because q runs over all positive values in the secular
equation (13).

A major improvement of the SCM over the SRM comes
through the quantity G(K, ω). In the SRM and its descendents,
G = G0 contains no symmetry breaking effects. In the SCM,
one finds G = G0 + Gs, where Gs stems from Js(0) and is
given by

where ′ >′ indicates that the integral is restricted to departing
electrons, i.e. vz ≥ 0. Note that Gs depends linearly on p.

(43)

C. The frequency and losses of SPWs

With Ω and G, we now proceed to solve Eq. (13) to find the

frequency ωs and damping rate γ of SPWs in the SCM.

Analytical analysis. As said before, the most significant im-
provement of the SCM over the SRM is through the term Gs.
We wish to do an approximate analysis to explicitly demon-
strate how Gs = G′s + iG′′s affects ωs and γ.

For this purpose, let us write G = G′+iG′′ and Ω = Ω′+iΩ′′
as well as ǫ = ǫ′ + iǫ′′, and assume that γ0/ωs, G′′/G′ and
Ω′′/Ω′ are all small quantities. Then, one can show that the
real part of Eq. (13) gives

becomes

where γLandau,interband,s = ωsηLandau,interband,s, the first term rep-
resents Joule heating, the second and the third stand for Lan-
dau damping and inter-band absorption, respectively, while
the last one is completely new due to G′′ = G′′s . For models
where Gs = 0, e.g. the DM, the HDM and the SRM, this new
term is absent.

eral argument given in Sec. V A.

which implies that inter-band transitions have little effect on
ηs, whereas a dielectric can enhance it by as much as 200%.
This is to be borne out in numerical analysis in what follows.

Numerical analysis. We solve Eq. (13) numerically to find
ωs and γ0 and how they vary with k and ǫd. We present the
results for diffuse surfaces with p = 0 only. In Eq. (13), the
integral over q extends to infinity. In numerical calculations,
we impose a cutoff qc. Roughly, qc ∼ a−1, where a is a lattice
constant. For metals, this means qc ∼ kF ∼ kp. In all the
numerical results presented here, we have chosen qc = 1.5kp.
For qc beyond this value, both ωs and γ0 quickly converge,
confirming that the results are independent of the choice of
54. Our results should be taken with a grain of salt for very
qc
small k ≪ ωs/c ≈ kpvF /c ∼ 0.01kp, where c is the speed
of light in vacuum, because of retardation effects neglected in
our theory.

The results are displayed in Figs. 2 and 3. In Fig. 2, we
show ¯ω = ωs + iγ0 as a function of k for various ǫd but without
inter-band transition effects (ǫp = 0). As seen in Fig. 2 (a),
in agreement with the analytical expression of ωs, increasing
ǫd leads to smaller ωs. Note that ωs is considerably larger
than what would be obtained by other models due to surface
effects. Meanwhile, γ0 increases with increasing ǫd, as seen
in Fig. 2 (b), in accord with Eq. (52). This increase comes
from the factor β, i.e. the presence of a dielectric enhances the
electric field at the surface; see Eqs. (17) and (18).

The effects of inter-band absorption and Landau damping
are illustrated in Fig. 3. Here we plot γ0 for ǫd = 1 under
several circumstances as described in the figure. We see that
inter-band transitions can strongly diminish γ0 in two ways, as
can be deduced from Eqs. (51) and (52). Firstly, there is the
screening effect (the curve with ǫp = 5). This leads to smaller
ωs and hence smaller γ0, while leaving η0 unaffected. Sec-
ondly, inter-band absorption further reduces γ0 (see the curve
with ǫp = 5 + 0.5i). As for Landau damping, it is sizable and
generally increases with k; see Refs.5,12. As such, γ0 decreases
as k increases. In relation to this feature, we should mention a
size effect11: in films of thickness d, γ0 is strongly suppressed
and quickly diminishes to zero when the wavelength becomes
longer than d. Echoing this, one can show that γ0 ∼ kvF van-
ishes for k ∼ 0 in the SIM46.

According to the SCM, the SPW loss rate is γ = τ−1−γ0. In
view of energy conversion, the expression implies a competi-
tion between the loss due to thermalization and the gain due to
energy transferred from the electrons to the waves12. Should
the condition γ0τ = 1 be fulfilled, lossless SPWs may be pro-
duced. In this section, we discuss this possibility against two
common plasmonic metals: silver and aluminum.

Note that τ−1 is the collision rate at the SPW frequency ωs.
Even at zero temperature and in defect-free samples, there is
sufficient phase space  --  available due to the effective tempera-

data on τ−1 for any materials. We then opt to estimate it by
the following formula32,

Here the first contribution comes from phonon scattering, the
second from electron-electron scattering and the third due to
impurity scattering to be neglected hereafter. The second term
generally underestimates the electron-electron rate in noble
metals and Al by a few times55. The coefficient ν0 ∼ kBTD/
may be determined from the slope of the phononic part of
the D.C. conductivity at temperatures higher than the Debye
temperature TD. Equation (54) shows that γresidual may well
amount to quite a few percentages of ωp for metals.

Silver.

In silver electronic transitions involving the 5s
and 4d bands have a dramatic effect on the properties of
SPWs35,56,57, leading to ωs ≈ 3.69 eV and ωb ≈ 3.92 eV
at long wavelengths, both lying far below the characteristic
frequency ωp = 9.48 eV. Experimentally32,58, it was found
that ν0 ∼ 0.1 eV ∼ 0.01ωp, in consistency with the value
of TD ≈ 220 K for Ag. The electron-electron scattering rate
according to Eq. (54) would be less than one percent of ωp,
while experimental measurements and more accurate expres-
sions55 place it about 0.02ωp. As such, we may reasonably
take γresidual ∼ 0.03ωp as an estimate.
The damping rate γ can be read out from the line shape of
the electron energy loss spectra (EELS). The temperature de-
pendence of γ has been recorded on a high-quality Ag single
crystal by means of EELS59,60. The data indicates that at low
temperature γ amounts to less than one percent of ωp, a value
a few times smaller than the as-projected γresidual. If Landau
damping and inter-band absorption are also counted, the dis-
crepancy can be more dramatic. In light of the present theory,
this discrepancy gives an estimate of γ0. The values suggest
that γ0 has substantially compensated for the collision losses,
i.e. γ0 ∼ γresidual, as borne out in the following analysis.
To evaluate γ0, ǫp(ω) needs to be supplied. Combin-

transmittance-reflectance measurements, Raki´c et al.36 em-
ployed K-K analysis and prescribed a parametrized dielectric
function  --  ǫ(b)
r (ω) in their notation  --  for the inter-band con-
tribution. Here, we use their fitting as an input for ǫp(ω) but
with a number of caveats. Firstly, their dielectric function was
deduced from measurements assuming the conventional elec-
tromagnetic responses without any surface effects considered
in the present paper. These effects, however, should be con-
sidered when analyzing ellipsometry and reflectance spectra.
A future study will be made to address this issue. Secondly,
their function very poorly reproduces the electron energy loss
spectra and the reflectance spectra, especially near the SPW
frequency of interest. Thirdly, their function does not give
an accurate partition into inter-band and intra-band contribu-
tions, e.g. ωp ≈ 8eV was used rather than the widely agreed
9.48eV57, which may overestimate the inter-band transition
effects. Finally, their function is defined only for real fre-
quency, and thus in general not suitable for ǫp(ω), where ω
is complex. To remedy this point, we substitute ǫ(b)
r [Re(ω)]
for ǫp(ω), which should be reasonable if γ/ωs ≪ 1.
The results are displayed in Fig. 4 (a), where the computed
γ0 is exhibited as a function of k at various values of ǫd. While
γ0 for SPWs supported on a pristine Ag surface (i.e. ǫd = 1) is
negligibly small and way below γresidual, by using a dielectric
it can be significantly enhanced at long wavelengths beyond
γresidual. This trend is consistent with Eq. (52). The fact that
γ0 can be made higher than γresidual suggests the possibility
of compensating for the plasmonic losses completely in Ag.
The situation is shown in Fig. 5. By interfacing the metal
with a lossless dielectric of ǫd = 5 and cooling it down toward
a critical temperature T ∗ ∼ 120K, one can diminish the net
losses as much as desired. It should be mentioned that, ǫd is
the constant at the frequency ωs as well.

Aluminum. Inter-band transitions in Al are widely consid-
ered less pronounced than in Ag. Nevertheless, their pres-
ence can still be felt, e.g. in the difference between the val-
ues of ωp ≈ 12.6eV and ωb ≈ 15.3eV. These numbers

FIG. 5. The possibility of compensating for the SPW losses in Ag.
A critical temperature T ∗ exists where γ0τ = 1. Cooling down the
system toward T ∗ reduces the losses to a vanishingly small level.
Here τ−1 is calculated by Eq. (53) with T D = 220K and ν0 = 0.1eV.

In addition, ωs ≈ 10.7eV62,63. γresidual may

be deduced from the experimental measurements performed
by Sinvani et al.64 and others65. These authors measured the
low temperature dependence of the d.c. resistivity ρ of Al.
Their data shows that ρ ≈ ρ0 + AT 2 + B(T /TD)5, where ρ0
stems from impurity and lattice dislocation scattering while
A and B are constants characterizing electron-electron scat-
tering and electron-phonon scattering, respectively. Analyz-
ing the data, the authors found that A ≈ 0.21pΩ·cm/K2 (a
lower bound) and B ≈ 4.9 · 104µΩ·cm for TD = 430K.
From this we obtain ν0 ≈ 0.18ωp and the residual electron-
electron scattering rate  --  a few times larger than what would
be obtained with Eq. (54)32  --  approximating 0.14ωp, yielding

γresidual ≈ 0.21ωp. It is noted that this value is comparable
to the width (∼ 1.5eV, nearly 0.12ωp) of the electron energy
loss peak near the frequency of the bulk plasma waves in Al62.
The as-obtained ν0 (and hence γresidual) represents probably an
overestimate66.

To compute γ0, we again resort to the fitting function con-
structed by Raki´c et al.37 and have it in place of ǫp(ω) in our
theory, in the same way as we did in the case of Ag. It goes
without saying that the same caveats should be kept in mind.
The results are shown in Fig. 4 (b). As expected, γ0 is compa-
rable to that in the absence of inter-band transitions [see Fig. 2
(b)], as these transitions are weak in Al. As is with Ag, γ0 of
SPWs in Al can also be fortified  --  but to a lesser extent  -- 
by a dielectric. Nevertheless, the enhanced γ0 still falls short
of γresidual unless for very long wavelengths where retardation
effects need to be properly accounted for.

The calculations reported in the above have assumed p = 0.
For surfaces strongly reflecting electrons (i.e. p > 0), γ0 could
be much lower12. We also point out that additional losses such
as due to SPWs converted into radiation are not considered.
They can be absorbed in the definition of τ−1.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In order to answer the two questions posed at the begin-
ning of this paper, i.e. (i) why had not previous work hit at
the possibility of lossless SPWs and (ii) how far is the latter
from reality, we have derived a universal macroscopic theory
of SPWs that applies to any electron dynamics. In light of the
theory, our answer to question (i) is simple: lossless waves are
possible only within a self-consistent description of physical
surfaces that takes care of translation symmetry breaking ef-
fects, a condition not met in existing work. As for question
(ii), we can only suggest an optimistic prospect rather than
an answer due to various uncertainties in inter-band transition
effects: our estimate shows that lossless waves may well be
within the reach in some materials.

Our results reveal two contradictory views regarding SPW
losses, as compared in Table I. According to the conventional
framework, as exemplified by the DM, the HDM and the
SRM,

γ(1) = τ−1 + γLandau + γinterband

and thus the SPW loss rate cannot be smaller than either of
τ−1 and γLandau. On the other hand, within the SCM, a totally
different picture emerges, giving

12

even at very short wavelengths38. For example, in single crys-
tal Ag, the loss rate measured by EELS59,60 is ∼ 1%ωp even
for k ∼ 1nm−1, whereas γLandau ∼ kvF ∼ 10%ωp. This dis-
crepancy is inexplicable by γ(1), but easily comprehensible by
γ(2), i.e. Landau damping has been overcompensated by γs.

Secondly, we note that the loss rate of bulk plasma waves
differs from that of SPWs primarily because of the absence of
γ0 in the former, as least in materials where inter-band effects
are not important. In those materials, bulk waves should be
generally much more lossy than SPWs, an observation that
seems in consistency with experience. For example67, the
loss rates for the SPWs and the bulk waves in potassium are
0.1eV−1 and 0.24eV−1, respectively, while those in cesium
are 0.23eV−1 and 0.75eV−1, respectively. In spite of these,
the general situation is obviously unclear at this stage.

Finally, we mention an experiment performed on a van der
Waals structure by Iranzo et al.68. These authors were able to
confine propagating plasmon between a graphene layer and a
metal array to the atomic limit without sacrificing its lifetime,
which obviously beats the limit set by Landau damping. From
an energy conversion point of view12, the plasmon in such a
structure is not much different from the surface plasmon on
a metal surface. Their result is compatible with γ(2): in ulti-
mate confinement γ0 tends to zero due to increase of Landau
damping (Fig. 3), leaving the loss rate saturating at τ−1, as ob-
served. We anticipate a similar trend for the losses of local
plasmon resonance on metal particles.

In the SCM we have assumed that the ground state of the
underlying metal be simply the Fermi sea. The fact that γ
can be made negative means an instability of the Fermi sea.
Upon entering such circumstances, the metals are expected to
undergo a transition into a different stable state, of which the
electrical responses cannot be captured by our current SCM
calculations. We will clarify the nature of this transition in the
future.

The results reported in this work should be of broad interest
to the researchers working in plasmonics, surface science and
condensed matter physics. We hope that experimentalists will
find the results fascinating enough to put their hands on them.

γ(2) = τ−1 − γ0,

γ0 = γs − γLandau − γinterband,

which suggests that the loss rate is always smaller than τ−1.
Here γs = η0ωs, see Eq. (51). To directly contrast these two
views, one has to measure separately τ−1 and γ. While the
latter can be measured in many ways, the former is difficult
to be directly measured. In what follows, we mention some
indirect observations defying γ(1) but supporting γ(2).

Firstly, we note that γ(2) naturally resolves a long-standing
puzzle, that of the apparent insignificance of Landau damping

Here we show that the usually claimed SPWs in the HDM
are incompatible with the waves in the DM. We put ǫp = 0
and ǫd = 1 for simplicity.
In the HDM, the electrons are
treated as a fluid described by two field quantities:
the ve-
locity field v(x, t) and the electron density field n0 + n(x, t),
where n(x, t) denotes the deviation from the mean density n0.
The charge density is then ρ(x, t) = n(x, t)e and the current
density is J(x, t) = e(n0 + n(x, t))v(x, t), which in the linear
responses regime becomes J(x, t) = n0ev(x, t).

This is the usually quoted dispersion relation claimed for the
SPWs in the HDM. As briefly captured in Sec. II C, this claim
is plainly false: in the limit v0 → 0, κ ∼ v−1
0 diverges and
hence R ∞
dz ρ(z) = ρ0κ−1 ∼ ρ0v0 vanishes, thus in contra-
diction with the DM. This would also erroneously imply that
Ez(z) did not change sign across the surface charge layer. It
was essentially this erroneous solution that had been identi-
fied by Harris14 and Garcia et al15 in their study based on
Boltzmann's equation. It is plausible that this is also so with
works employing a more microscopic approach such as the
density functional theory, at least those using the so-called
'infinite barrier' model for mimicking the surface30. For ex-
ample, Feibelman identified a solution of uniform potential
and hence empty of charges but with frequency ωp/ √2 in the
long wavelength limit47, exactly in this kind.

In our theory,
no restrictions are placed on Jz(x0) and thus the equation of

For k = 0, it reduces to that for the DM. The dependence of κ′
on k is shown in Fig. 6 (b), alongside that of κ.

The widely used SRM assumes that the electrons be specu-
larly reflected off a surface. One would then expect that Jz = 0
and no SPWs would exist in this model. However, in the main
text we have shown that what the SRM actually does is an
extension of the HDM. The question then is, how do SPWs
originate in the SRM? Here we show that the answer lies with
the 'fictitious' charge sheet assumed in the model.

We follow the SRM formalism as explained in many pa-
pers20,26,69 -- 72 and employ it to study the response to an ex-
ternal distribution of charge ρext(z; k, ω) placed outside the
metal. We take ρext(z; k, ω) = ρ0(k, ω)δ(z − z0) for simplic-
ity, where z0 < 0. In the SRM, the total electrostatic potential,
φtot(z; k, ω) = φ(z; k, ω) + φext(z; k, ω), where φ is the potential
produced by the induced charges ρ(z; k, ω), is written

φtot(z; k, ω) = Θ(z)φm(z; k, ω) + Θ(−z)φv(z; k, ω),

45 Note that ǫHDM differs from the bulk dielectric function that is
usually quoted in the literature, which reads 1 − ω2
p/( ¯ω2 − K2v2
0).
This function can be easily obtained from Eqs. (A2) and (A5) by
adding an external term Eext to E and taking ∂x · Eext = 4πρext. The
dielectric function then by definition is given by ρext/(ρext + ρ).
The difference arises from two non-equivalent approaches to the
HDM, see Ref.46 for more discussions.

53 In Refs.10,11, JSRM was called J′. The expressions given there were
typographically flawed, which though does not affect any state-
ments or other expressions given in those work.

54 The solutions to Eq. (13) are independent of the choice of qc
as long as the latter is sufficiently large. For example, for k =
0.07kp, we find that ¯ω/ωp = 0.93 + 0.095i, 0.95 + 0.099i, 0.95 +
0.099i, 0.96 + 0.098 for qc/kp = 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, respectively.
There is no difference within the numerical resolution ±0.005.
More discussions on this can be found in Ref.46.
55 More detailed calculations [W. E. Lawrence, "Electron-electron
scattering in the low-temperature resistivity of the noble met-
als." Phys. Rev. B 13 5316 (1976)] shows that the second term
in Eq. (54) should be multiplied by a factor (π3/12)Γ∆(ωp/εF ),
where Γ and ∆ are constants with their product of the order of 0.4
 --  for noble metals and Al64  --  related to the geometry of the Fermi
surface. Similarly, the third term in Eq. (53) should be multiplied
by the same factor. For noble metals and Al this factor is around
1.5. However, for sodium and potassium it is nearly zero.

66 The often quoted resistivity for Al at room temperature is around
3µΩ·cm, see R. A. Serway, Principles of Physics (2nd ed., Lon-
don: Saunders College Pub.). Using this to evaluate the contri-
bution of the electron-phonon scattering to τ−1 would give ν0 ≈
0.01ωp, a much smaller value than what would be obtained with
the low temperature data in Ref.64,65. This discrepancy might be
due to the uncertainty as to the actual scattering mechanism re-
sponsible for the resistivity at low temperatures.
