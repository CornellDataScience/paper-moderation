Intrinsic contribution to the spin Hall effect in a two-
dimensional silicene is considered theoretically within
the linear response theory and Green function formalism.
When an external voltage normal to the silicene plane is
applied, the spin Hall conductivity is shown to reveal a
transition from the spin Hall insulator phase at low

voltages to the conventional insulator phase at higher
voltages. This transition resembles recently reported
phase transition in a bilayer graphene. The spin-orbit
interaction responsible for this transition in silicene is
much stronger than in graphene, which should make the
transition observable experimentally.

1 Introduction There is currently a great interest in
two-dimensional IVA materials like graphene and silicene.
The peculiar electronic transport properties of these ma-
terials, which follow from their unusual band structure,
make them promising for applications in future nanoelec-
tronics. As the properties of graphene are already rather
well known [1,2], the silicene  --  a two-dimensional silicon
lattice  --  has been synthesized only very recently [3] and at-
tracts great attention both theoretical and experimental [4].
Similarly to graphene, the silicene is a material with
linear electronic energy spectrum near the Fermi level. The
intrinsic spin-orbit interaction, however, opens an energy
gap, which in silicene is relatively wide. The corresponding
intrinsic gap in graphene is rather negligible and therefore
the effects due to its presence are not observable exper-
imentally. The large energy gap as well as compatibility
with silicon-based conventional electronics make the sil-
icene a very interesting material  --  also for spin electronics.
In this paper we study the spin Hall effect [5,6] in sil-
icene, induced by intrinsic spin-orbit interaction. This con-
tribution to the spin Hall conductivity follows from a non-
trivial trajectory of charge carriers in the momentum space
due to the spin-orbit contribution of a perfect crystal lattice
to the corresponding band structure, and therefore it is also

called topological spin Hall effect (for review of SHE see
e.g. Refs. [7,8]).

The buckled structure of silicene (see Fig.1) makes the
corresponding spin-orbit interaction rather strong. More-
over, in additon to the usual intrinsic spin-orbit interaction,
there is also an intrinsic Rashba like term, and both terms
contribute to the spin Hall conductivity. For simplicity, we
neglect here the role of structural defects, assuming per-
fect crystalline two-dimensional lattice. As in the case of
graphene, the spin Hall conductivity is shown to be finite
when the Fermi level is in the gap. Since the Rashba type
interaction is rather small, the intrinsic spin Hall conductiv-
ity in silicene is almost quantized. We also show that elec-
tric field (gate voltage) normal to the silicene plane leads to
a transition from the spin Hall insulator phase to the normal
insulator state, in agreement with predictions by Ezawa [9,
10]. We also note that the transverse spin current in sys-
tems with spin-orbit coupling may be generated by a tem-
perature gradient instead of electric field, and the effect is
then known as thermal spin Hall or spin Nernst effect.

2 Model The crystallographic structure of silicene is
shown schematically in Fig.1 and is similar to graphene ex-
cept that the planes corresponding to the two atomic sub-

as Jsn = (1/2) [v, sn]+, where vi = (1/¯h)(∂H/∂ki) is

3 Spin Hall conductivity We consider now spin Hall
conductivity, separately for the case without vertical bias
and for the case with a vertical voltage applied. Let us be-
gin with the former case.

The case of V = 0 Calculating the appropriate
Green functions and following the general procedure [12],
one finds the spin Hall conductivity from Eq.(3). When the
Fermi level µ (measured fom the middle of the gap) is lo-
cated either in the valence or conduction bands, the spin
Hall conductivity is given by

When, in turn, the Fermi level is inside the energy gap, one

One can note, that due to the intrinsic Rashba type spin-
orbit coupling, the spin Hall conductivity for the Fermi
level in the energy gap is generally not quantized. How-
ever, the parameter λR = 0.7 meV in silicene is relatively
small, so the main contribution to the spin-orbit coupling is
due to the term proportional to λso. Indeed, assuming the
relevant parameters one finds σsz
xy(λR 6=
0) ≈ 10−7. Thus, the influence of intrinsic Rashba spin-
orbit interaction on the spin Hall conductivity is rather mi-
nor and will be neglected in the following. Accordingly,
assuming λR = 0 one may rewrite Eqs (4) and (5) as

xy(λR = 0) − σsz

for the Fermi level in the conduction/valenece bands and in
the energy gap, respectively. The latter formula shows that
spin Hall effect in silicene is quantized when the Fermi
level is in the gap.

voltages (a-d), two dimensional crystallographic structure

lattices are now spatially separated. The buckled atomic
arrangement has two important consequences. First, such a
structure gives rise to a relatively large intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling responsible for a sizable energy gap. This spin-
orbit coupling also includes the Rashba like term. Second,
since the planes of the corresponding two sublattices are
separated, by applying perpendicular voltage one can mod-
ify and control the electronic band structure. In the follow-
ing considerations we calculate the spin Hall conductivity
taking into account both terms in the intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling as well as the effects due to perpendicular exter-
nal voltage.

To describe electronic states in silicene we use an effec-
tive Hamiltonian that was derived within the tight-binding
method and first-principle calculations [11]. In the sublat-
tice space, the matrix form of this Hamiltonian for the K
point of the Brillouin zone takes the form

H0 = 

h

v(kx + iky)

v(kx − iky)

−h

! ,

(1)

where v = ¯hvF with vF being the Fermi velocity, and

h = −λsoσz − aλR(kyσx − kxσy) + V σ0.

(2)

The parameters λso and λR describe the two terms of the
intrinsic spin-orbit interaction, V is the perpendicular volt-
age (in energy units), and σα are the unit (α = 0) and Pauli
(α = x, y, z) matrices in the spin space. The corresponding
energy spectrum near the K point is shown in Fig.1(a-d) for
indicated gate voltages. It is evident that gate voltage first
closes the gap and then opens it again when V increases
further.

Behavior of the spin Hall conductivity with increasing
voltage V and position of the Fermi level µ is shown in
Fig.2, where contributions from both K points of the Bril-
louin zone are included. This figure clearly shows that the
energy gap, where the spin Hall conductivity is finite and
quantized, shrinks with increasing voltage V . At some
critical value of V  the gap becomes closed, and then
opens again with V  increasing further. However, the spin
Hall conductivity vanishes then for µ in the gap. This be-
havior is also evident in Fig.3, where some cross-sections
of Fig.2 for selected values of the voltage V are plotted.
Both figures clearly indicate a transition from spin Hall
insulator phase at voltages V  smaller than the critical
voltage to conventional insulating behavior at voltages V 
larger than the critical one.

4 Summary To summarize, we have derived some
analytical formula for spin Hall conductivity in silicene
due to intrinsic spin-orbit interaction. We have shown that
the intrinsic Rashba type term in spin-orbit interaction has
a negligible influence on the spin Hall conductivity, so the
latter is quantized when the Fermi level is inside the gap.
Furthermore, we have shown that there is a transition from
the spin Hall insulator phase to the conventional insulator
one with increasing external gate voltage applied perpen-
dicularly to the layer plane.
