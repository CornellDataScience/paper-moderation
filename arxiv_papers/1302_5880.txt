Electron spin relaxation due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism is investigated in bilayer graphene
with only the lowest conduction band being relevant. The spin-orbit coupling is constructed from
the symmetry group analysis with the parameters obtained by fitting to the numerical calculation
according to the latest report by Konschuh et al.
[Phys. Rev. B 85, 115423 (2012)] from first
principles. In contrast to single-layer graphene, the leading term of the out-of-plane component of the
spin-orbit coupling in bilayer graphene shows a Zeeman-like term with opposite effective magnetic
fields in the two valleys. This Zeeman-like term opens a spin relaxation channel in the presence of
intervalley scattering. It is shown that the intervalley electron-phonon scattering, which has not
been reported in the previous literature, strongly suppresses the in-plane spin relaxation time at high
temperature whereas the intervalley short-range scattering plays an important role in the in-plane
spin relaxation especially at low temperature. A marked nonmonotonic dependence of the in-plane
spin relaxation time on temperature with a minimum of several hundred picoseconds is predicted in
the absence of the short-range scatterers. This minimum is comparable to the experimental data.
Moreover, a peak in the electron density dependence of the in-plane spin relaxation time at low
temperature, which is very different from the one in semiconductors, is predicted. We also find a
rapid decrease in the in-plane spin relaxation time with increasing initial spin polarization at low
temperature, which is opposite to the situation in both semiconductors and single-layer graphene.
A strong anisotropy between the out-of- and in-plane spin relaxations at high temperature is also
revealed with the out-of-plane spin relaxation time being about two orders of magnitude larger than
the in-plane one. Detailed comparisons of the temperature and electron density dependences of the
spin relaxation with the existing experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 047206 (2011), Phys. Rev.
Lett. 107, 047207 (2011) and Nano Lett. 11, 2363 (2011)] are reported.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, single-layer graphene has received
much attention due to its two dimensionality, Dirac-
like energy spectrum and outstanding spin-coherence
properties.1 -- 14 Specifically, the hyperfine interaction and
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are considerably weak,15 -- 25
suggesting a long spin relaxation time (SRT) in single-
layer graphene.
This long SRT makes single-layer
graphene a promising candidate for spintronic applica-
tion. So far, a number of experiments on spin relax-
ation have been carried out, with the SRTs being orders
of magnitude shorter than theoretical prediction.3,26 -- 41
This pronounced discrepancy has provoked many in-
vestigations on the extrinsic effects of spin relaxation
such as adatoms,24,42 -- 47 curvature,16,48 -- 50
substrate
effects44,51,52 and contacts.30,39,40,53 Consisting of two
layer graphene, bilayer graphene (BLG) also possesses
good spin-coherence properties.20,21,54 -- 57 Additionally, in
contrast to single-layer graphene, BLG has a tunable gap
caused by an out-of-plane electric field,55,56,58 -- 62 which
can be used to turn on or off the electronic transport. In
addition, in the absence of space inversion symmetry, the
intrinsic SOC in the pseudospin space of BLG provides an
out-of-plane effective magnetic field near the Dirac points
whereas the intrinsic SOC of single-layer graphene only
induces a shift of the energy spectrum.36,44,55 Moreover,

the electron-phonon coupling becomes more complex in
BLG due to the existence of more phonon modes.63 -- 65
So far, some efforts have been made to investigate the in-
travalley electron-phonon coupling.63 -- 65 Specifically, the
intravalley electron-acoustic (AC) phonon coupling has
been calculated by Viljas and Heikkila63 with the con-
tinuum theory and also by Borysenko et al.64 from first
principles. To explore the intravalley electron-optical
(OP) phonon coupling, the tight-binding model, density
functional theory and first principles approach are em-
ployed by Viljas and Heikkila,63 Cappelluti et al.65 and
Borysenko et al.,64 respectively. However, the intervalley
electron-phonon coupling, which has been shown to play
an important role in spin relaxation in rippled single-
layer graphene,50 has not been reported in the previous
literature. All these intriguing features make BLG an
attractive material for investigation.

Very recently, some attention has been devoted to the
spin relaxation in BLG.37 -- 39,66 -- 68 Experimentally, the
SRTs of BLG on SiO2 substrate37,38,66 or in freely sus-
pended BLG68 are reported to be of the order of 0.01-
1 ns. Both Yang et al.66 and Han and Kawakami37 mea-
sured the temperature and carrier dependences of the
SRT. Yang et al.66 showed that the SRT is weakly de-
pendent on temperature. However, Han and Kawakami37
reported a marked decrease of the SRT with the increase
of the temperature. As for the carrier density depen-

dence, the decrease of the SRT with increasing carrier
density at low temperature is reported in both exper-
iments. However, at room temperature, Yang et al.66
observed an increase of the SRT with increasing density
whereas the SRT measured by Han and Kawakami37 ex-
hibits a marginal density dependence. In addition, Yang
et al.66 also showed that the SRT scales inversely with the
mobility at both room and low temperatures. In contrast
to the above two experiments based on the micromechan-
ically exfoliated BLG samples, Avsar et al.38 carried out
the experiment in chemical vapor deposition grown BLG.
The carrier density and temperature dependences of the
SRT measured are comparable to the ones by Yang et
al.66 both quantitatively and qualitatively. Motivated
by these experiments, Diez and Burkard67 calculated
the electron spin relaxation due to the D'yakonov-Perel'
(DP) mechanism69 with only the long-range electron-
impurity scattering included in BLG. They claimed to
obtain a good agreement with the experimental data of
Yang et al..66 It is noted that the effective SOC (re-
ferred to as the spin-orbit field in Ref. 67) used in their
calculation is induced by an interlayer bias voltage to-
gether with the intrinsic SOC in the pseudospin space.54
However, the intrinsic SOC in the pseudospin space be-
comes incomplete in the presence of the interlayer bias
since the interlayer bias breaks the space inversion sym-
metry and leads to additional extrinsic SOC terms in
the pseudospin space.55 Also even with only the intrinsic
SOC in the pseudospin space in their calculation, they
overlooked the out-of-plane component of the effective
SOC. As will be shown later, the leading term of this
component leads to a Zeeman-like term in the two val-
leys and makes a dominant contribution to the in-plane
spin relaxation. Moreover, they neglected the electron-
phonon and electron-electron Coulomb scatterings.
In
fact, the electron-electron Coulomb scattering has been
demonstrated to be very important for the spin relax-
ation in semiconductor systems70 -- 77 and also single-layer
graphene at high temperature.36 The electron-phonon
scattering has also been shown to play an important role
in spin relaxation in both semiconductors70 and single-
layer graphene36 at high temperature. Therefore, both
have to be included in studying the spin relaxation.

In the present work, with the electron-electron
Coulomb, (both the intra- and inter-valley) electron-
phonon, possible short-range9 as well as long-range
electron-impurity scatterings explicitly included, we in-
vestigate the electron spin relaxation due to the DP
mechanism in BLG with only the lowest conduction band
being relevant by the kinetic spin Bloch equation (KSBE)
approach.70 The SOC of the lowest conduction band near
the Dirac points Ωµ(k) is constructed from the symme-
try group C3 in the presence of an out-of-plane electric
field.78 Its three components Ωµ
i (k) (i = x, y, z) can be

written as (see Appendix A)

Ωµ

x(k) = α1(k) sin θk + µ[α2(k) sin 2θk

+ α3(k) sin 4θk],

Ωµ
y (k) = −α1(k) cos θk + µ[α2(k) cos 2θk

(2)
(3)
with µ = 1(−1) standing for K(K′) valleys and k and
θk representing the magnitude and the polar angle of
the momentum k relative to K(K′) points, respectively.
The coefficients αi(k) (i = 1-3) and β1,2(k) are given
in Appendix A by fitting to the numerical results calcu-
lated according to the latest report by Konschuh et al.55
from first principles with both the intrinsic and extrin-
sic SOC terms in the pseudospin space included. The
out-of-plane component Ωµ
z (k) [Eq. (3)], which has not
been reported in the previous literature, is induced by
the intrinsic SOC in the pseudospin space in the absence
of space inversion symmetry, whereas the in-plane com-
ponent is contributed by both the intrinsic and extrinsic
SOCs in the pseudospin space. This is very different
from the case in single-layer graphene where the intrin-
sic SOC in the pseudospin space only induces a shift
of the energy spectrum in the conduction band.36,44,55
We find that the magnitudes of both the out-of- and in-
plane components decrease with the increase of k at large
momentum, indicating a suppression of the inhomoge-
neous broadening71 by increasing momentum.55 This is
very different from the case in both semiconductors and
single-layer graphene.36,70 Additionally, the leading term
of the out-of-plane component, i.e., µβ1(k), serves as a
Zeeman-like term with opposite effective magnetic fields
perpendicular to BLG plane in the two valleys, similar to
the case in rippled single-layer graphene.50 This Zeeman-
like term, together with the intervalley scattering, opens
a spin relaxation channel. This spin relaxation channel
suppresses the in-plane SRT significantly at high temper-
ature by the intervalley electron-phonon scattering and
also at low temperature by the short-range scattering.9
In addition, we find that although such Zeeman-like
terms also exist in the in-plane components of the SOC,
their contributions to the out-of-plane spin relaxation are
marginal since these terms are of the high order of the
momentum. This leads to a strong anisotropy between
the in-plane and out-of-plane spin relaxations. We also
find that the in-plane SRT shows a marked nonmonotonic
dependence on temperature with a minimum down to
several hundred picoseconds in the absence of short-range
scatterers. This minimum is comparable to the experi-
mental data. The nonmonotonic behavior results from
the crossover between the weak and strong intervalley
electron-phonon scattering. Moreover, we predict a peak
in the density dependence at low temperature, which is
very different from the one in semiconductors.77,79 As for
high temperature, the SRT shows a monotonic increase
with increasing density. We also find that the in-plane
SRT decreases rapidly with increasing initial spin polar-

ization at low temperature, which is very different from
the previous studies in both semiconductors72,76,80,81 and
single-layer graphene.36 Finally, we report detailed com-
parisons of the temperature and electron density depen-
dences with the existing experiments.37,38,66

This paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II, we
present our model and construct the KSBEs. The main
results are given in Sec. III. In Sec. IIIA, we investigate
the temperature, electron density and also initial spin
polarization dependences of the electron spin relaxation
in the absence of short-range scatterers. The anisotropy
of the spin relaxation is also addressed in this part. In
Sec. IIIB, we show detailed comparisons of the tempera-
ture and electron density dependences of the spin relax-
ation with the existing experiments with the inclusion of
short-range scatterers. We summarize in Sec. IV.

II. MODEL AND KSBES

We start our investigation from the AB-stacked BLG
on SiO2 substrate. The spinless π-band structure can be

and ΨB2 (k), where A1 refers to the A sublattice in the
lower layer, B2 to the B sublattice in the upper layer,
etc., and k represents the two-dimensional wave vec-
tor counted from the Γ point. Here, γ0 and γ1 de-
scribe the nearest-neighbor intralayer and interlayer hop-
pings whereas γ3 and γ4 stand for the indirect hop-
pings between two layers. ∆ represents the asymme-
try in the energy shift of the on-site energy due to
the interlayer hopping. The potential V = eEzdeff /2

two valence ones. In our calculation, we concentrate on
the heavily n-doped case with only the lowest conduction
band being relevant whereas other bands are separated
by large energy intervals. For convenience, the eigen-
value and the corresponding eigenfunction of the lowest
conduction band at k are denoted by ǫµk and ψµ
k, respec-
tively.

By incorporating the spin degree of freedom, the effec-
tive Hamiltonian of the lowest conduction band is given
by

Here, σ are the Pauli matrices. Ωµ(k) stands for
the effective magnetic field of the SOC, which is con-
structed from the symmetry analysis with the parame-
ters obtained approximately by fitting to numerical re-
sults based on the report by Konschuh et al..55 The an-
alytical form of the SOC with three components Ωµ
i (k)
(i = x, y, z) is shown in Eqs. (1-3) and the explicit numer-
ical calculation is given in Appendix A. It is noted that
at large momentum, the analytical result agrees with the
numerical one fairly well (see Appendix A).

We then construct the microscopic KSBEs70 to study
the electron spin relaxation in BLG. The KSBEs read70

A. Spin relaxation in BLG with high mobilities

In our calculation, the out-of-plane electric field is
chosen to be a typical value Ez = 0.14 V/nm37 and
the long-range impurity density is taken to be Ni =
1.5×1011 cm−2. The corresponding mobility in our inves-
tigation is of the order of 104 cm2/(V s), which is about
1-2 orders of magnitude larger than those reported in
the existing experiments in BLG on SiO2 substrate37,38,66
and comparable to the ones in the experiments in freely
suspended BLG.68 It is noted that the short-range scat-
tering is not included in this subsection.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

By numerically solving the KSBEs, one obtains the
time evolution of spin polarization along direction n

P (t) = Pµk Tr[ρµk(t)σ · n]/Ne with Ne being the elec-

tron density. Then the SRT can be determined from the
slope of the envelope of the spin polarization P (t).70 The
initial spin polarization P (0) is set to be 2.5 % and the
spin-polarization direction n is along the x-axis unless
otherwise specified. It is noted that all the parameters
used in our calculation are listed in Table I. It is also
noted that the SOC is calculated both fully numerically
following the approach by Konschuh et al.55 and analyt-
ically by using Eqs. (1-3). The SRT calculated with the
analytical form of the SOC and with the explicit numer-
ical one agrees fairly well with each other.

1. Temperature dependence of spin relaxation

We first investigate the temperature dependence of the
spin relaxation. In Fig. 1, the SRT along the x-axis τsx
is plotted as function of temperature T . It is seen that
τsx changes little with the temperature at low temper-
ature (i.e., T ≤ 60 K). However, as T becomes larger,
the SRT decreases dramatically with increasing temper-
ature.
In particular, the SRT reaches down to several
hundred picoseconds at T = 200 K, which is comparable
to the experimental values.37,38,66,68 A detailed compar-
ison with the existing experiments will be discussed in
Sec. IIIB. When T further increases, the SRT begins to
increase with T .

the calculation without the long-range electron-impurity (•),
electron-AC-phonon (N), electron-RI-phonon ((cid:3)), electron-
electron Coulomb (+) or intervalley electron-phonon ((cid:4)) scat-
tering as function of temperature T . It is noted that when
T > 150 K, only the total SRT and the calculation without
the intervalley electron-phonon scattering are shown since the
remaining ones almost coincide with the total SRT. In the cal-
culation, the electron density Ne = 3 × 1012 cm−2.

To understand the behavior of the spin relaxation, we
show in Fig. 1 the temperature dependence of the SRT
calculated with the electron-electron Coulomb, electron-
RI-phonon, electron-AC-phonon,
long-range electron-
impurity, or intervalley electron-phonon scattering re-
moved, separately. We find that at low temperature,
the intervalley electron-phonon scattering is negligible.
Therefore, spins relax independently in the two val-
leys and the SRT is solely determined by the intraval-
ley spin relaxation channel. Specifically, the long-range
electron-impurity scattering is dominant, which leads
to a weak temperature dependence of the SRT.36,50
With the increase of the temperature, the contribution
of the long-range electron-impurity scattering becomes
marginal whereas the intervalley electron-phonon scat-
tering becomes important. This intervalley scattering
opens another spin relaxation channel together with the
Zeeman-like term with opposite effective magnetic fields
in the two valleys, which is similar to the case in rippled
single-layer graphene.50 This Zeeman-like term is given
by µβ1(k) [Eq. (3)] approximately. Then the spin relax-
ation due to the above intervalley spin relaxation channel
can be approximated by the rate equations50

where Sµk, ωµk = [µβ1(k)]z and τv(k) represent the in-
plane spin vectors in each valley, spin precession vec-
tor along the z-axis and the intervally electron-phonon

scattering time, respectively. According to the report by
Zhang et al.,50 the in-plane SRT is given by

Here, τsy stands for the SRT along the y-axis. Since
the system we investigate is always in the degenerate
regime, we take τsx,y (k) ≈ τsx,y (kF ) approximately with
kF representing the Fermi wave vector. In our calcula-
tion, the SRT along the x-axis is solely determined by the
intervalley electron-phonon scattering at T ∼ 100-400 K.
At T = 100 K, β1(kF )τv(kF ) ≈ 160, i.e., the inter-
valley electron-phonon scattering is in the weak scatter-
ing limit. As a result, the SRT τsx = τv(kF ) according
to Eq. (14), which decreases with the enhancement of
the intervalley scattering as the temperature increases.
Nevertheless, at T = 400 K, β1(kF )τv(kF ) ≈ 0.04, i.e.,
the intervalley scattering is in the strong scattering limit.
Then the SRT τsx = 2/[β1(kF )2τv(kF )] from Eq. (14),
which increases with increasing of T . Therefore, the SRT
first decreases then increases with increasing temperature
when the intervalley scattering changes from the weak to
strong scattering limit. The crossover between the weak
and strong intervalley scattering limit is determined by
τv(kF )−1 ≈ β1(kF ).50 At this crossover point,

τsx ≈ β1(kF )−1.

(15)
Here τsx ≈ 315 ps, very close to the value 330 ps shown
in the figure.
It is noted that the electron-electron
Coulomb scattering is unimportant in the whole temper-
ature regime.

2. Electron-density dependence of spin relaxation

Then we turn to study the electron-density depen-
dence.
In Fig. 2, the SRT along the x-axis is plotted
against the electron density at T = 100 (300) K. One ob-
serves a peak in the electron-density dependence of the
SRT at T = 100 K whereas the SRT increases with the
increase of the electron density when T = 300 K. We
first focus on the case at T = 100 K and show the SRT
with the intervalley electron-phonon scattering excluded
in Fig. 2. It is seen that when the electron density is low,
the intervalley electron-phonon scattering is marginal.
The SRT is then determined by the intravalley spin relax-
ation channel and hence increases with the suppression
of the inhomogeneous broadening71 as the electron den-
sity increases.55 The suppression of the inhomogeneous
broadening can be understood from the decrease of the
spin splitting with increasing momentum at high momen-
tum [see Eqs. (1-3)], as shown in Fig. 9 in Appendix A.
This behavior is very different from the case in both semi-
conductors and single-layer graphene.36,70 When the elec-
tron density further increases, the intervalley electron-
phonon scattering becomes important. This intervalley

scattering is always in the weak scattering limit with
β1(kF )τv(kF ) ≥ 40 and therefore τsx = τv(kF ) accord-
ing to Eq. (14). As a result, the SRT decreases with the
increase of the intervalley scattering and hence the in-
crease of the electron density.50 Therefore, in the whole
electron-density regime, a peak is observed. It is noted
that this peak is very different from the one predicted
by Jiang and Wu79 in semiconductors where the peak
is attributed to the crossover from the nondegenerate-
to-degenerate limit. As for the case at T = 300 K,
the SRT is always dominated by the intervalley electron-
phonon scattering as shown in Fig. 2 by comparing the
SRT calculated with and without the intervalley electron-
phonon scattering. Since this intervalley scattering is in
the strong scattering limit with β1(kF )τv(kF ) ≤ 0.75,
the SRT τsx = 2/[β1(kF )2τv(kF )] from Eq. (14). This
SRT increases with increasing electron density since both
β1(kF ) and the intervalley scattering time τv(kF ) de-
crease with the increase of the electron density.50,55

Influence of initial spin polarization

The initial spin polarization dependences of the SRT
along the x-axis at T = 100 and 300 K are shown
in Fig. 3.
It is seen that the SRT decreases rapidly
with the increase of initial spin polarization P at T =
100 K whereas the SRT shows a slight increase with in-
creasing P at T = 300 K. The rapid decrease of the
SRT at T = 100 K is very different from the previous
studies in both semiconductors72,76,80,81 and single-layer
graphene36 where the SRT increases significantly with in-
creasing initial spin polarization. In the previous studies,
the increase of the SRT originates from the contribution

of the Coulomb HF term.72 This term serves as an effec-
tive magnetic field along the direction of the spin polar-
ization, which blocks the spin precession induced by the
Dresselhaus88 and/or Rashba89 SOCs and slows down
the spin relaxation. However, the contribution of the
Coulomb HF term is marginal to the spin relaxation in
our investigation, which is shown in Fig. 3 by comparing
the the SRT calculated with and without the Coulomb
HF term. Here, the SRT is determined by the inter-
valley electron-phonon scattering, as shown in Fig. 3 by
comparing the calculation with and without the interval-
ley electron-phonon scattering. The intervalley electron-
phonon scattering transfers electrons between the two
valleys. The transferred electrons experience opposite ef-
fective magnetic fields induced by the Zeeman-like term
in the two valleys, which are not affected by the effective
magnetic field induced by the Coulomb HF term. More-
over, the intervalley electron-phonon scattering is in the
weak scattering limit at low temperature and hence the
SRT τsx = τv(kF ) [see Eq. (14)]. The intervalley scatter-
ing time τv(kF ) decreases significantly with the increase
of the initial spin polarization as the density of states in-
creases with the polarization. Therefore, the SRT shows
a rapid decrease with the initial spin polarization at
T = 100 K. As for the case of T = 300 K, the SRT is also
determined by the intervalley electron-phonon scattering
in comparison with the case of T = 100 K. However, in
contrast to the case of T = 100 K, the intervalley scat-
tering is in the strong scattering limit. This makes the
SRT present an opposite trend to the case of T = 100 K.
A mild increase of the SRT results from the insensitivity
of τv(kF ) to the initial spin polarization at T = 300 K.

4. Anisotropy of spin relaxation

We also address the anisotropy of the spin relaxation
with respect to the spin polarization direction. Due to
the existence of the out-of-plane effective magnetic field
[see Eq. (3)], the in-plane SRTs are identical.50 For com-
parison, we plot the temperature dependence of the SRT
along the x (z)-axis as the red curve with crosses (blue
curve with open squares) in Fig. 4.
It is seen that in
comparison with the SRT along the z-axis, the one along
the x-axis is comparable at low temperature and orders
of magnitude smaller at high temperature. As men-
tioned previously, the SRT along the x-axis is strongly
suppressed by the intervalley spin relaxation channel in-
duced by the intervalley electron-phonon scattering and
the Zeeman-like term in the two valleys at high tem-
perature. However, the contribution of this spin relax-
ation channel to the SRT along the z-axis is marginal [see
Eqs. (1-2)]. Therefore, a strong anisotropy between the
out-of- and in-plane spin relaxations is observed at high
temperature.

B. Comparison with experiments

As mentioned in the introduction, experiments on
spin relaxation have been carried out in BLG on SiO2
substrate37,38,66 or in freely suspended BLG68 very re-
cently by different groups. The in-plane SRTs in these
experiments are of the order of 0.01-1 ns, which are
comparable to our theoretical results at high tempera-
ture (several hundred picoseconds). This motivates us
to carry out a detailed comparison with the existing ex-
periments. In these experiments, the gate voltage, tem-

of the short-range scatterers. In the inset, we show the tem-

corresponding to the case of VCNP + 20 V. (b) Grey dashed
and skyblue double-dotted chain curves are obtained from
our calculations corresponding to the case of VCNP + 20 V by
including the short-range scatterers, with a fixed short-range
impurity density nd = 2×1010 cm−2 and a tunable nd (shown
in the inset), respectively. We also show the dependence of τs
on nd (with the scale on the top of the frame) at T = 50 K
with other conditions the same as the case of VCNP + 20 V.
The short-range potential strength V0 = 6 × 10−17 meV m2.

perature and electron density90 (tuned by the gate volt-
age) are given explicitly. However, some parameters such
as the out-of-plane electric field and the impurity den-
sity are not available in the experiments. In our calcu-
lation, the out-of-plane electric field is taken to be the
ratio of the gate voltage to the thickness of the substrate
approximately.16,46 The impurity density is obtained by
fitting to the mobility or the spin diffusion coefficient
given in the experiments.91 In addition, we assume the
initial spin polarization along the x-axis without loss of
generality since the in-plane spin relaxations are identical
as pointed out previously.

We first compare the temperature dependence of the
SRTs obtained from the experiments and calculation
from our model.
In these experiments, the mobilities
are reported of the order of 102-104 cm2/(V s). The
SRTs from different groups are comparable as shown
in Fig. 5. However, the SRT from the experiment of
Han and Kawakami37 decreases with increasing temper-
ature whereas the ones from the experiments of Yang
et al.66 and Avsar et al.38 show a marginal tempera-
ture dependence. In addition, Han and Kawakami37 re-
ported the longest SRT among these experiments, in-
dicating that their experimental data may contain less
extrinsic effects. Motivated by this, we show our com-
parison with the experiment of Han and Kawakami37 in
Fig. 5(a). The experimental data with the gate voltage
VCNP + 20 (60) V corresponding to the electron density
Ne = 1.47 (4.4) × 1012 cm−2, is labeled as + (N). By
fitting to the spin diffusion coefficient given in the ex-
periment, we obtain the long-range impurity density Ni
shown in the inset as the curve with •. In contrast to
the long-range impurity scattering, the contribution of
other scatterings to the spin diffusion coefficient (mobil-
ity) is marginal. Then we calculate the SRT correspond-
ing to VCNP + 20 (60) V shown as the red solid (orange
chain) curve. A crossover is observed in the tempera-
ture dependence of the SRT, similar to the one shown
in Sec. IIIA. It is seen that the SRT from our calcula-
tion is comparable to the experimental data at high tem-
perature. This suggests that the intervalley spin relax-
ation channel induced by the intervalley electron-phonon
scattering and the Zeeman-like term in the two valleys
addressed in Sec. IIIA, plays an important role at high
temperature. Nevertheless, the SRTs are still larger than
the experimental data with an observable difference at
high temperature. Additionally, at low temperature, our
results are orders of magnitude larger than the experi-
mental ones since the intervalley electron-phonon scat-
tering is marginal at low temperature and the SRT is
determined by the long-range electron-impurity scatter-
ing in our calculation. Due to the existence of all these
discrepancies, one has to take into account extrinsic ef-
fects such as adatoms,24,42 -- 47 curvature,16,48 -- 50 substrate
effects44,51,52 and also contacts.30,39,40,53 In the above
experiments on BLG, the spin polarized electrons are
all injected from ferromagnetic contacts.37,38,66,68 As re-
ported, the ferromagnetic electrodes generate stray fields,

8

which cause spin precession around the contact.53 As a
result, the stray fields may have a strong influence on
the observed experimental results. Additionally, electron
scattering by the tunneling contacts may also be respon-
sible for the available experimental data.30,39,40

In addition to the above extrinsic effects, the short-
range scatterers may also be an extrinsic source.9,92,93
Here, we discuss
short-range
scatterers9 in detail. The scattering term induced by the
short-range scatterers is given by

with nd and V0 denoting the short-range impurity den-
sity and the constant short-range potential strength,
respectively.9 This scattering term contributes to both
the intra- and inter-valley scatterings. The intervalley
scattering opens an intervalley spin relaxation channel
together with the Zeeman-like term in the two valleys [see
Eq. (3)], similar to the intervalley electron-phonon scat-
tering. However, in contrast to the intervalley electron-
phonon scattering, the intervalley scattering induced by
the short-range scatterers is insensitive to the tempera-
ture and may play an important role in the in-plane spin
relaxation especially at low temperature. Here, we choose
a fixed short-range impurity density nd = 2 × 1010 cm−2
and potential strength V0 = 6×10−17 meV m2. It is noted
that although with this additional short-range scatter-
ing included, the mobility is still dominated by the long-
range electron-impurity scattering since the contribution
of the long-range electron-impurity scattering is about
four orders of magnitude larger than that of the short-
range one. We calculate the temperature dependence
of the SRT corresponding to the case of VCNP + 20 V
in the experiment of Han and Kawakami37 by including
the additional short-range scattering. The result is plot-
ted as the grey dashed curve in Fig. 5(b). A crossover
is also observed at high temperature due to the contri-
bution of the intervalley electron-phonon scattering as
pointed out previously. By comparing our calculation
with the experimental data labeled as +, we find that our
result becomes comparable at low temperature. Further-
more, by fitting to the experimental data with tunable
short-range impurity density shown as the curve with ◦ in
the inset, our result labeled as the skyblue double-dotted
chain curve agrees fairly well with the experimental data
in the temperature regime lower than the crossover. As
for the temperature higher than the crossover, our result
becomes even larger than the experimental one once the
short-range scattering is included. This is because that
the intervalley electron-phonon scattering is in the strong
scattering limit. With the inclusion of the short-range
scattering, the intervalley scattering becomes stronger
and the SRT becomes larger. This discrepancy may be
attributed to other extrinsic effects.

As mentioned above, the SRT can be tuned by the
short-range impurity density. We show the short-range

impurity density dependence of the in-plane SRT at
T = 50 K as the purple dotted curve in Fig. 5(b), with
all other conditions remaining the same as the case of
VCNP + 20 V. A valley is also observed, similar to the
case of the temperature dependence discussed above. At
low temperature, the intervalley electron-phonon scat-
tering is negligible. The SRT is then determined by the
intervalley short-range scattering. The valley originates
from the crossover between the weak and strong inter-
valley short-range scattering limit by tuning the short-
range impurity density. At the crossover point, the SRT
τs ≈ 232 ps according to Eq. (15), close to the value
252 ps shown in the figure. This crossover point gives the
minimum of the SRT and can be taken as a criterion for
determining the possible contribution of the short-range
scattering. Specifically, the crossover point τs ≈ 316,
258, 232, 283, and 249 ps corresponding to the case of
the experimental data shown as N, ×, (cid:3), H and (cid:4), re-
spectively. We find that both the experimental data of
Han and Kawakami37 and Avsar et al.38 are larger than
the crossover point whereas the one of Yang et al.66 is
smaller. This suggests the experimental data of Han and
Kawakami37 and Avsar et al.38 can be explained by the
short-range scatterers. As for the experiment of Yang et
al.,66 some other extrinsic effects have to be considered.

blue chain curve is calculated with the short-range scatterers
with the short-range impurity density nd = 1010 cm−2 and
potential strength V0 = 6 × 10−17 meV m2.

Then we turn to compare the electron density depen-
dence of the SRTs from the experiments and our calcu-

9

lation. Among the experiments, Han and Kawakami37
measured the longest SRT at low temperature (up to
several nanoseconds) shown as the dotted curve with N
in Fig. 6. This SRT is about one order of magnitude
larger than the ones from other experimental cases. In
addition, the SRTs from the experiments show different
dependences on electron density. Specifically, at low tem-
perature, both Avsar et al.38 and Yang et al.66 show a
decrease of the SRT with the increase of the electron
density whereas a mild peak is observed by Han and
Kawakami.37 At room temperature, the SRTs from Avsar
et al.38 and Yang et al.66 increase with increasing elec-
tron density whereas Han and Kawakami37 reported an
insensitive density dependence of the SRT.

We first show our comparison with the experimen-
tal data at low temperature. As shown in Fig. 5(a),
our result is orders of magnitude larger than the ex-
perimental data of Han and Kawakami37 at low tem-
perature without short-range impurities. However, with
the inclusion of the short-range scatterers, our result
shows good agreement with the experimental data. Here,
with the short-range scatterers explicitly included, we
also show our comparison with the experimental data
of Han and Kawakami.37 With a fixed short-range im-
purity density nd = 1010 cm−2 and potential strength
V0 = 6 × 10−17 meV m2, the electron density depen-
dence of the SRT from our calculation is shown as blue
chain curve in Fig. 6. We find that our result marginally
agrees with the experimental data shown as the dotted
curve with N. Better agreement can be obtained with
tunable short-range impurity density.
In addition, we
also find that the experimental data of Avsar et al.38 can
be explained by the short-range scatterers. However, to
account for the experimental data of Yang et al.,66 one
has to include other extrinsic effects. This is because the
SRT of Yang et al.66 is smaller than the crossover point in
the short-range impurity density dependence of the SRT
(230-320 ps), which is taken as a criterion for the possible
contribution of the short-range scattering as mentioned
previously.

We then address our comparison with the experimen-
tal data at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 5(a),
our result is larger than the experimental data of Han
and Kawakami37 with an observable difference at room
temperature without short-range impurities. With the
short-range scatterers included, the SRT from our calcu-
lation becomes even larger than the experimental data
as mentioned previously, indicating that other extrinsic
effects have to be taken into account. Here, we show our
comparison with the experiment of Han and Kawakami37
without extrinsic effects. The experimental data and our
result are shown as the solid curve with • and the red
solid curve in Fig. 6, respectively. We find that the SRT
in our calculation is about three times as large as the
experimental one in low electron density regime and one
order of magnitude larger than the experimental one in
high density regime.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we have investigated the electron spin re-
laxation due to the DP mechanism in BLG with only
the lowest conduction band being relevant. The SOC
of the lowest conduction band is constructed from the
symmetry group analysis with the parameters obtained
by fitting to the numerical calculation according to the
latest report by Konschuh et al.55 from first principles
with both the intrinsic and extrinsic SOC terms in the
pseudospin space included. We find that the magni-
tudes of both the out-of- and in-plane components of
the SOC decrease with increasing momentum at large
momentum, indicating a suppression of the inhomoge-
neous broadening with the increase of the momentum.
This is different from the case in both semiconductors
and single-layer graphene. Additionally, the leading term
of the out-of-plane component of the SOC serves as a
Zeeman-like term with opposite effective magnetic fields
in the two valleys, which is similar to the case in rip-
pled single-layer graphene. This Zeeman-like term, to-
gether with the intervalley electron-phonon and/or pos-
sible intervalley short-range scatterings, opens an inter-
valley spin relaxation channel, which has not been re-
ported in the literature in BLG. The intervalley electron-
phonon scattering is derived by using the tight-binding
model.
In addition to the intervalley electron-phonon
and short-range scatterings, we also include the long-
range electron-impurity, electron-electron Coulomb and
intravalley electron-phonon scatterings to calculate the
SRT. We find that the in-plane SRT is strongly sup-
pressed by the intervalley electron-phonon scattering at
high temperature. In contrast to the intervalley electron-
phonon scattering, the intervalley short-range scattering
is insensitive to the temperature and plays an important
role in the in-plane spin relaxation especially at low tem-
perature.

In the absence of short-range scatterers, a marked non-
monotonic temperature dependence of the in-plane SRT
is predicted with a minimum SRT down to several hun-
dred picoseconds. This nonmonotonic behavior origi-
nates from the crossover between the weak and strong in-
tervalley electron-phonon scattering. Moreover, we pre-
dict a peak in the electron density dependence of the
in-plane SRT at low temperature, which is very different
from the one in semiconductors. At high temperature,
the in-plane SRT increases monotonically with increas-
ing density. We also find that the in-plane SRT decreases
rapidly with the increase of the initial spin polarization at
low temperature. This is very different from the previous
studies in both semiconductors and single-layer graphene
where the SRT increases significantly with increasing ini-
tial spin polarization. The physics is understood that
the spin relaxation time is determined by the interval-
ley electron-phonon scattering, which transfers electrons
between the two valleys. The transferred electrons expe-
rience opposite effective magnetic fields in the two val-
leys, which are not affected by the Coulomb HF term.

10

In addition, a strong anisotropy between the out-of- and
in-plane spin relaxations is also addressed at high temper-
ature where the out-of-plane SRT is about two orders of
magnitude larger than the in-plane one. As for low tem-
perature, the out-of- and in-plane spin relaxation times
are comparable.

We also show our comparison with the existing exper-
iments of Han and Kawakami,37 Avsar et al.38 and Yang
et al..66 We find that without intervalley scattering, the
SRT is orders of magnitude larger than the experimental
data in the whole temperature regime. With the inter-
valley electron-phonon scattering explicitly included, the
SRT from our calculation becomes comparable to the ex-
perimental data at high temperature but still orders of
magnitude larger than the experimental data at low tem-
perature. In addition, a crossover in the temperature de-
pendence of the in-plane SRT is shown, which also results
from the crossover between the weak and strong interval-
ley electron-phonon scattering. With the inclusion of the
short-range scatterers, our result agrees fairly well with
the experimental data in the temperature regime lower
than the crossover. As for the temperature higher than
the crossover, other extrinsic effects have to be included.
Moreover, a crossover point is also shown in the short-
range impurity density dependence of the in-plane SRT,
which gives a minimum for determining the possible con-
tribution of the short-range scattering. The experimental
SRT larger than the minimum can be explained by the
possible short-range scatterers whereas other extrinsic ef-
fects have to be considered for experimental data smaller
than the minimum.

As reported by Konschuh et al.,55 the small group of
the Dirac points is C3 in the presence of an out-of-plane
electric field. Following from the symmetry group C3,78
we derive an analytical form of the SOC near the Dirac
points [see Eqs. (1-3)].
In these equations, the coeffi-
cients αi(k) (i = 1-3) and βi(k) (i = 1-2) are obtained by
fitting to the numerical calculation from Eqs. (A5) and
(A7) using the Pad´e approximation.94 Specifically, the
coefficients αi(k) (i = 1-3) in Eqs. (1-2) read

dent of the applied electric field. The electric field de-
pendences of αj
i (i = 1-2,
j = 1-4) are plotted in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. It is
noted that the Pad´e approximation94 can give a precise
description of αi(k) (i = 1-3) and βi(k) (i = 1-2) at large
momenta near the Dirac points, which can be populated
and play an important role in spin relaxation according
to the experimental conditions (heavily doped).37,38,66,68
With only a simple linear k-order approximation, αi(k)
and βi(k) agree with the numerical results only at very
small momentum near the Dirac points.

We also show in Fig. 9 the spin splitting of the lowest
conduction band calculated with analytical form of the
SOC (blue dashed curve) and with the explicit numer-
ical one (red solid curve). We find that the analytical

momentum.
In addition, the spin splitting decreases
with increasing momentum at large momentum, which
is very different from the case in both semiconductors70
and single-layer graphene.36

82 It is noted that when dealing with the delta function in

the scattering terms, we neglect the anisotropy of the en-
ergy spectrum since the effect of the anisotropy on spin
relaxation is marginal.67
