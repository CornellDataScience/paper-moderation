Polarization effects are included exactly in a model for a quantum dot in close proximity to a
planar interface. Efficient incorporation of this potential into the Schrödinger equation is utilized to
map out the influence of the image potential effects on carrier tunneling in such heterostructures.
In particular, the interplay between carrier mass and the dielectric constants of a quantum dot,
its surrounding matrix, and the electrode is studied. We find that the polarizability of the planar
electrode structure can significantly increase the tunneling rates for heavier carriers, potentially re-
sulting in a qualitative change in the dependence of tunneling rate on mass. Our method for treating
polarization can be generalized to the screening of two particle interactions, and can thus be applied
to calculations such as exciton dissociation and the Coulomb blockade. In contrast to tunneling via
intermediate surface localized states of the quantum dot, our work identifies the parameter space
over which volume states undergo significant modification in their tunneling characteristics.

INTRODUCTION

The interface between a semiconductor quantum dot
(QD) and an extended film is an important part of
the functionality of many nanostructured devices, with
such diverse applications as photovoltaics1 -- 3, low thresh-
old lasers4,5, single electron memory6, and single pho-
ton emitters7,8. Understanding the physics of this in-
terface is important for the ultimate technological chal-
lenges in these applications: increasing energy conversion
efficiency of solar cells, controlling speed and volatility in
memory devices, and creating reliable on-demand sources
of single photons.

In novel photovoltaic concepts, absorption of light by
QD chromophores can be followed by the transfer of hot
carriers to a nearby electrode. This allows the excess
carrier energy to be harvested and can fundamentally
change solar cell efficiency. Hot carrier transfer was re-
cently demonstrated for optically excited PbSe QDs cou-
pled to a TiO2 substrate3. In laser applications, the re-
verse process is utilized to design the transfer of cold
carriers from a quantum well to a QD, reducing the en-
ergy deposition by hot carriers and leading to higher gain
and lower thresholds4,5.
In addition, rapid progress is
being made on creating novel memory devices based on
QDs. The large tunability of QDs allows flexibility to
construct fast volatile memories as well as non-volatile
memories with very long retention times, low electrical
damage, and the possibility of charge storage based on
holes as opposed to electrons6. The design strategy of
each of these devices must take into account the effects
of the local electrostatic environment on tunneling.

Optically driven QD emitters are designed such that
carrier tunneling and non-radiative energy transfer mech-
anisms are slower than the exciton radiative recombina-
tion rate in order to utilize their fluorescence for single
photon generation9. The reverse process of non-radiative
energy transfer from a quantum well to colloidal QDs has

been also been demonstrated as a way of electrically in-
jecting electron-hole pairs into the dot, where they re-
combine and emit light10. Other electrically driven emit-
ters exploit the tunneling of carriers into and out of epi-
taxial QDs at two different energies to drive the system
into electroluminescence9,11,12. The local electrostatic
environment in both types of emitters plays an impor-
tant role in determining the energy levels and tunneling
rates, which in turn control the frequency of emitted light
and the efficiency of these devices. This is also becoming
more important as research progresses towards single QD
emitters7,8.

The tunnel coupling that controls the rate of carrier
transfer in all these tunneling based devices can be heav-
ily influenced by the image charge effects in the barrier
separating the two components between which the car-
rier transfer takes place. That this classical force on a
non-classical electron in the barrier region is essential for
accurately determining tunneling rates is well-known in
the field of scanning tunneling microscopy13. Even when
tunneling is not an issue, as in optically driven QD emit-
ters, image charge effects are still important, and serve to
lower the exciton energy in the QD, as well as to modify
its transition dipole moment. This affects non-radiative
energy transfer via the transition amplitudes as well as
via resonance with surface excitations that absorb or emit
this energy. Therefore, electrostatics within and at the
interfaces of sub-systems can be one of the key players in
each of the above applications of nanostructures.

In this paper, we re-examine a model system consist-
ing of a spherical QD coupled to a planar surface. An
exact solution of the Poisson equation, including all im-
age effects induced by the carrier charge distribution, is
presented in a form that can be efficiently incorporated
into the solution of the Schrödinger equation. Because of
this efficiency, a large parameter space can be explored in
this model and we exploit this capability to demonstrate
the impact of the image effects on the carrier tunnel-
ing rates. In addition to barrier lowering effects, we find

a given choice of these two parameters in the calculations

from the figure. One first identifies the vertical line clos-
est to b to choose a barrier material. The range of QD
materials then fall within the overlap of this line with the

interesting consequences of the interplay between the in-
duced electrostatic potential and the confinement of the
particle inside the QD.

The system we have modeled is sketched in Fig. 1, and
is represented by a point in the parameter space defined
by three dielectric constants (see figure), confinement po-
tentials, and effective masses, in each region. To these
material parameters, we add QD radius and its distance
from the electrode as two geometrical parameters . We
find that this space is best understood when we replace
QD by the ratio  = QD/b, and L by the contrast
fI = (b − L)/(b + L). Thus fI = 0 represents no
image potential at the electrode interface, and fI = −1
represents the opposite limit of the image potential due
to a metal. Similarly  = 1 represents the lack of image
potential at the QD surface, while  → ∞ would rep-
resent a metallic nanoparticle as far as electrostatics is
concerned.

Figure 2: The barrier dielectric, b, and the ratio,

 = QD/b, over the space spanned by QD materials on
the vertical and barrier materials on the horizontal axis.
The values of the barrier dielectric are indicated below

the respective materials. At the intersection of two

lines, the color indicates the value  takes for the given
combination of QD material and the barrier material

the dot is embedded in. The values of dielectric

constants used are for ω → ∞ since tunneling times are

assumed instantaneous.

In Table I, we categorize the aforementioned classes of
devices in terms of the ratio . Within each class, devices
can be found over the entire range of values of the con-
trast, fI. We present calculations at the two extremes,
fI = 0 and fI = −1, for each system studied below.
However the choice of fI for a given electrode can be
subtle. In systems with low b, fI ≈ −1 for a substrate
made of metal or an undoped semiconductor. At high b,
as in the case of III-V epitaxial systems, fI ≈ 0 for an
undoped substrate while it may be −1 for metallic elec-
trodes. In the latter case, it is important to realize that
the metallic electrodes are often doped semiconductors in
which the carrier densities are of the order of 1018 cm−3,
which yields an average distance between dopants equal
to 100 Å. For QDs with diameters smaller than 10 nm,
the electrode may be best approximated via the static
dielectric constant of its host material. Thus setting the
value of the parameter fI can be subtle in some systems,
and its choice must take into account the properties such
as dopant densities and the plasma frequency inside the

Having defined the strategy of our study in terms of a
parameter space, we now connect the most important pa-
rameters to real materials and device systems. In Fig. 2,
we show a map of the values of b and  over a space
spanned by the QD and the barrier materials. Thus for

Table I: Various QD-based systems in the parameter

barrier and the QD. The classification, and the shaded
heading in the low and high  blocks refers to the most

common types of systems. The nanocrystal based
systems may be found with both high and low 
depending on the materials used. Specific devices

realized under each system often span the entire range
of dielectric contrast fI between the background and

the planar medium.

Let us consider the device examples of Table I in light
of the parameter space of our model. The physical quan-
tities important in the interplay of confinement and the
induced potential are the effective mass inside the QD,
the barrier potential, and the barrier dielectric. This im-
plies a dependence of tunneling rate on the mass inside
the QD, which may at first seem strange since a Fermi
Golden Rule calculation of the tunneling rate involves
only the wavefunctions within the barrier region14; the
dependence of this rate on the mass inside the barrier is
well-known5. However, the amplitude of the wavefunc-
tion in the barrier region depends on the behavior of the
wavefunction inside the QD and at its boundaries, and
therefore on the mass inside the QD volume. The sub-
stantial difference in effective mass often seen in semicon-
ductors (including electrons, heavy holes and light holes)
then suggests that the rates for electron and hole tunnel-
ing in QD-based structures could also be quite different,
as seen for example in models for QD laser structures5.
In fact, depending on the dielectric contrast between
the barrier and the QD, we find that image effects can
lead to substantial localization of heavy carriers inside
the QD with a significant change in tunneling rate. The
trend in tunneling rate with carrier mass can thus be sub-
stantially altered from the simpler picture found when
image effects are neglected.
In particular, we identify
a regime in which a heavy carrier tunnels at a similar
or much higher rate than a light carrier.
Interestingly
Mazur et al point to several experimental measurements
in QD laser systems showing more modest differences

3

between these rates for the two carrier types4 than is
expected from a simple WKB15 analysis5. While the
interpretation of these particular experiments requires
a proper accounting of surface states and defect states
within the barrier, we find that in a parameter regime
somewhat different from the conditions in these experi-
ments, the image effects can also yield similar results.

As is known from elementary electrostatics, the polar-
ization induced at an interface of two materials is directly
proportional to the dielectric contrast between them16.
In the experiment of Tisdale et al.3, the dielectric con-
stant of the TiO2 electrode is 8.4 and that of the PbSe
QD is 22.4 at high frequencies17. On the other hand, the
organic materials used to passivate the QDs, hydrazine
and ethanedithiol, both have optical refractive index of
1.517. Thus approximating the high-frequency dielectric
constant (∞
) within the barrier region to be 2.3, sub-
stantial image effects are expected at both the electrode
and the QD surface. In our model, this corresponds to
high  and fI → −1. We find that this system should be
in the parameter regime in which heavier particles tunnel
faster than the lighter ones.

Furthermore, the most interesting materials for the
QD chromophore in photovoltaic systems generally have
small bandgaps, and therefore large dielectric constants.
These are generally colloidal QDs passivated by organic
materials with relatively low dielectric constants at high
frequencies. Therefore, these systems lie in a regime
where the effects of interfacial polarization are maxi-
mized. A range of behaviors can thus result from the
interplay of confinement due to the barrier potential and
the QD dielectric constant relative to that in the barrier.
Laser systems based only on III-V semiconductors are
in a region where the dielectric contrast between each
pair of materials is low, and thus the interfacial polar-
ization is small. In our model, this corresponds to low
 and fI → 0. On the other hand, non-volatile single
electron memory systems generally contain narrow gap
nanocrystals (e.g. Si, InAs, GaSb) embedded inside wide
gap layers (e.g. III-nitrides, AlAs, silica) for greater re-
liability. Therefore they lie in a regime where the inter-
facial polarization may be large, much like that for the
photovoltaic systems discussed above. However, unlike
photovoltaic systems, these devices often have tunable
potentials, with barriers that are often thicker than 10
nm. Therefore only the image effects at the QD/barrier
interface are important, or in terms of our model param-
eters: a high  and fI → 0.
Quantum dot emitters are often embedded in high di-
electric materials, and therefore have little dielectric con-
trast with their surroundings. This limits the light collec-
tion efficiency, and there is thus a growing interest in sys-
tems with QDs coupled to optical fibers18, or embedded
in host materials such as photonic crystals19, MgS20, and
porous silicon21. In addition, large confinement poten-
tials in these cutting edge systems would also remove the
limitation of operating only at low temperatures. From
the foregoing discussion, and the details presented below,

these types of systems are expected to show large interfa-
cial polarization at the QD boundary, which corresponds
to a high  in our model. Furthermore fI ≈ 0 for op-
tically pumped emitters since they do not depend on a
nearby charge reservoir. In electrically pumped emitters,
fI may take values between 0 and −1, but the electrode
properties must first be carefully examined to set a par-
ticular value as we emphasized in the above discussion.
In novel energy transfer emitters10, passivated colloidal
QDs lie on the surface of a dielectric, resulting in a value
of −1 < fI < 0. Thus we expect QD emitters to span
a large region in the parameter space of our model, and
to exhibit a rich interplay between polarization and con-
finement affecting the binding energy, fluoresence, and
electroluminescence in these systems.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we begin
with the Schrödinger equation for a single electron inside
the system shown in Fig. 1(a), and derive explicit expres-
sions for its potential energy, and its rate of tunneling
between the QD and the electrode. The mathematical
details of the derivation are discussed in the Appendix.
In Sec. III, we apply this theory to computationally ex-
plore the parameter space in the manner described above.
In particular, we present the crossover of trends in tun-
neling rates for various combinations of parameters, and
interpret this behavior in terms of the interplay discussed
above. Following this section are our conclusions and re-
marks on the use of our results inside more sophisticated
ab-initio calculations of coupled Schrödinger and Poisson
equations.

The basic features of many devices can be modeled
with the QD treated as a dielectric sphere and with the
electronic structure of the device treated via an effective

where a is the QD radius, b is the dielectric constant
of the barrier region, m(r) is the ratio of effective mass
to bare mass m0, V (r) is the confinement potential, and
Σ(r) is the electrostatic self-energy in the dimensionless
form.

The electrostatic self-energy of a charge in an isolated
spherical QD was first derived by Brus23 for the infinite
spherical well model, and then by Banýai et al. for a finite
well22. Here we generalize these results by accounting for
the geometric progression of image charges induced on
the electrode and the QD surface. The potential energy
is derived based on re-expansion of spherical harmonics24
around a shifted origin. This approach may be found in
several sources, including recent work on plasmonics of
nanoparticles supported on a substrate25. As appropri-
ate for the optical domain, the solutions presented there
apply to an electric field uniform over the particle. Solu-
tions to the Laplace equation within the space bounded
by axially symmetric charge distributions in the same
geometry have also been given26. We present a solution
applicable to an arbitrary charge density, as needed for
the self energy in the Schrödinger equation.

We first consider the potential at r of a source charge
at s, and write it as a superposition of four sources:
the point charge, the multipole moments of the dielec-
tric sphere, the image of the point charge in the plane,
and the image of the multipole moments in the plane (see
Fig. 1). Subjecting the contribution from surface charge
densities to a multipole expansion, we write the potential
as

In the second and third terms of (2), the functions Ylp(r)
are spherical harmonics written as a function of the direc-
tion vector. The second term corresponds to the surface
charge density in real space, while the third term is due
to the image of this charge density. In this term, we have
already accounted for the change in the sign of the mul-
tipoles in the image space, which depends on l and m,
where the integer l is the total angular momentum and
p the azimuthal quantum number.

We find the self consistent multipole moments, Qlp(s)
by enforcing the electrostatic boundary conditions at the
surface of the sphere as shown in Appendix A. Imposing
axial symmetry of the complete system uncouples the
different p, and the Qlp(s) for each p satisfy a set of
linear equations indexed by l:

The details of this entire derivation are also provided
in Appendix A. The above equation for self consistent
multipole moments couple the moments for all angular
momenta l to each other. In practice, truncation must
be applied by choosing l < lmax, and increasing lmax
until the final result converges. We found that lmax > 15
is sufficient in all cases we have applied this model to,
and generally set lmax = 50.

Equations (2)-(6) can be applied immediately to the
interaction energy of two charged particles, e.g. for treat-
ment of excitons, by considering one charge placed at s
and using Qlp(s) to calculate the potential at r, the loca-
tion of the second charge. In the following, we focus only
on the single particle self-energy Σ and its consequences
for tunneling. We write Σ as a sum of two contributions,
Σ0 + Σ1, where Σ0 is the interaction energy without the

Note that in the above expression, both series start at
l = 1 because the monopole contribution from the in-
duced charge on the image sphere is explicitly taken into
account by the last term. In the derivation of the for-
mula for Σ0, we followed Bánayi et al 22 to separate the
divergent terms of the multipole series and sum them to
identify closed form expressions that can be regularized
(see Appendix B). The form of our expressions is slightly
different from theirs due to the zeroth order multipole
contribution written explicitly in our formula, while it
is subsumed into the series in theirs.
It represents the
part of energy stored in the dielectric medium of infi-
nite extent when a charge is embedded inside it. Here
this energy is for the QD dielectric relative to the barrier
medium. In both the above formulas, Sl(ρ) equals ρl for
ρ < 1 and ρ−(l+1) otherwise.

Since macroscopic electrostatics is being used in this
model, the material parameters at the QD boundary are
taken to follow an abrupt profile.
In the case of effec-
tive mass, we handle the discontinuity numerically using
the ghost fluid method27. In the case of electrostatic po-
tential, the self energy diverges at the boundary, which
could be regularized by the microscopic profile of the po-
tential. Since the present paper does not include defects
of the atomic scale potential, we do not compute this po-
tential and instead continuously join the self energy with
the confining potentials of the electrode and the QD rel-
ative to the background medium28. We do so by linearly
interpolating Σ between its computed values within one
lattice spacing inside and outside the QD interface. At

6

the remaining interface, the planar surface, we set the
image charge interaction to

Vimg = afI q2 1 − exp{−(z + h/2)/η}

4(z + h/2)

,

(9)

where η is chosen to yield a specified potential at the
image plane. Results are generally insensitive to η for
sufficiently deep surface potential because we focus only
on wavefunctions that are decaying exponentially in this
region.

We now consider tunneling of a single electron from the
QD to the electrode. We model the electrode as a thick
square well of finite depth with respect to the barrier at
z = −h/2, and an infinite potential wall at the opposite
end z = −h/2−w, letting w → ∞ in the final calculation
to effect a semi-infinite substrate. Thus letting k be the
in-plane wavevector and kz the transverse wavenumber,
we write a complete set of basis functions of the electrode
as,

where A normalizes ψL to the volume of the electrode
(in the limit of semi-infinite electrode below, the volume
drops out in the final expressions) and tan δ = kz/κ. In
this simple model, the numbers kz, κ, and k are all real

as those with surface states, will be necessary to obtain
accurate rates. Regardless of the model used, the states
would still decay exponentially perpendicular to the sur-
face, and would be described by a (lattice) translational
symmetry along the electrode surface29. In addition, the
states enter into our tunneling rate below in such a way
that only the wavefunction outside of the electrode is
required; above, we have included the simplified form
in z < −h/2 region for completeness. Therefore, at the
length scale used in the calculations below, the matrix el-
ements between the QD states and the basis states of the
electrode, are captured well by the above model. How-
ever, significant quantitative differences would arise due
changes in density of states, as well as additional modes
due to the surface states.

=

d2rψ∗L(kz, k; r) [H(r) − HL(r)] ψD;n(r). (14)
Here HL is the Hamiltonian for the electrode in isolation
of the QD, and the eigenstates of which are the above
ψL(kz, k; r).

The Bardeen tunneling matrix element is tradition-
ally written as a surface integral. This form can be ob-
tained by the use of the divergence theorem, but the for-
mula (14) is more convenient for our calculations. How-
ever, the aspect of Bardeen theory that is essential in this
expression is the orthogonality assumption, which yields
a matrix element of the difference between energies. We
obtained this form by adding and subtracting HL to
H, and then exploiting the relation (cid:104)ψL;kz,kHLψD(cid:105) =
EL;kz,k(cid:104)ψLψD(cid:105) ≈ 0. The subtraction is advantageous
because it naturally restricts the integration domain in
(14) to the volume outside the electrode, and thus allows
the possibility of computing ψD and ψL in separate calcu-
lations, in which one would focus on the QD and electrode
properties respectively. The subtracted Hamiltonian HL
is non-vanishing in calculations in which the termination
of the potential at the surface occurs smoothly into the
junction, as is the case in atomic scale modeling. In the
present calculation, HL describes a square well and thus
makes no contribution outside the planar surface.
From (12), we see that κ ∝ √mb, which in turn is
proportional to log γ. Remarkably, we find that the tun-
neling rate also shows a similar dependence on the mass
inside the QD. While this is not a fundamental rela-
tionship, we find that when the tunneling rates follow
a monotonically decaying profile with respect to m, they
can be described well by the expression,

γ0 = αe−τ mβ

,

(15)

where α, β, τ depend on the parameters of our physical
model.

Finally, we remark that in our calculations, we com-
pute the electrostatic potential and the QD states using
high frequency dielectric constants for each material (de-
noted commonly as ∞
). This is so because we ignore
the time-dependence of a single tunneling event, and thus
model tunneling as instantaneous. To be consistent with
this viewpoint, or this regime of tunneling, we must take

the material response to be of high frequency. Thus the
initial and final states of the above matrix element are
computed using ∞
. We now turn to results of our cal-
culations employing the above model.

III. RESULTS

A. Potential and wavefunctions

7

We begin by plotting the electrostatic potential, and
the QD wavefunctions that result from it, to identify the
key manifestations of the interplay between confinement
(via mass) and the induced polarization. Our choice of
parameters in this subsection is made to obtain the clear-
est possible visualization of the impact of this interplay.
Thus we have selected a relatively low b = 2.5, and a
barrier potential of 0.8 eV to best capture the qualitative
aspects of the self energy and wavefunctions simultane-
ously within the QD volume and the barrier region. We
verify below that the trends in the tunneling rates, based
on the physical intuition derived here, continue to hold in
more realistic parameter regimes. The distance between
the QD and the electrode is chosen such that the effec-
tive junction width (the smallest distance between the
two surfaces) is about 1 nm. At the microscopic scale,
this width may be understood as the distance between
the image planes of the two surfaces.

Figure 3 displays the contour plot of dimensionless self
energy in the equatorial plane of the QD, which lies per-
pendicular to the electrode surface. We observe that the
junction potential is reduced significantly in a narrow re-
gion between the two surfaces. The reduction is clearer
in the lower panel of Fig. 3, where the potential is plotted
along the z-axis for various dielectric ratios .

Thus outside the QD, the potential becomes more at-
tractive as  increases, while inside the QD, the bound-
ary becomes more repulsive. Within the volume of the
QD the slope of the potential, resulting from the image
charges on the electrode, reduces as a result of dielec-
tric shielding. The narrow attractive potential straddling
outside the QD is due to the image potential at the QD
boundary, and it becomes asymmetric with greater depth
on the side facing the electrode due to the image charges
on the electrode. Below, we will see that the asymmetry
partially attracts the charge close to the electrode, and
shifts the center of mass of the wavefunctions towards the
electrode. Therefore, it could significantly affect tunnel-
ing, especially for high  which results in a deep potential
well. Since, this attractive potential is beyond the atomic
scale variations in the potential at the surface of the QD,
we must distinguish it from the surface traps formed at
the defects. Therefore, in order to keep the terminology
clear, we call this the image potential trap (IPT) follow-
ing Banýai et al 22.

For quickly estimating the self energy effects, it may
be convenient to approximate Σ as simply the sum of Σ0
and Vimg, the potential of the image charge in (9). The

results derived in the previous section allow us to quan-
tify the error in this approximation. In the right hand
panel of Fig. 3, we plot this error, which is the contribu-
tion by the electrode's correction to self-consistent multi-
poles corresponding to the total self energy plotted in the
left hand panel. It is clear from the plot that the extra
contribution is significant only within the junction, and
the correction caused by the image effect to the dipolar
and higher order field of the QD is mostly quantitative
in Σ and less than 30% in most of the space. The size
of this correction increases with the QD size as a larger
fraction of the charge on its surface becomes close to the
electrode and the potential approaches that of a charge
between two parallel plates. The contribution decreases
as  → 1, and saturates as (− 1)/( + 1) → 1. This may
be valuable in design considerations involving charged
quantum dots. For example, in systems such as epitax-
ial III-V QDs, the multipole contribution is small, while
for inorganic colloidal QDs on planar surfaces and sur-
rounded by vacuum or organic solvents, the contribution
could approach its saturation value.

In Fig. 4(a) we plot the contours of the lowest en-
ergy electron wavefunctions in the equatorial plane for
parameter choices corresponding to the two categories
in Table I above:
low and high values of . For each
, we plot results at two extreme values of fI: matched
dielectric at the planar interface boundary with no im-
age effect (fI = 0), and a metallic boundary with the
full image effect (fI = −1). The image effect due to the

junction and an overall shift of the center of mass to-
wards the electrode. The center of mass shift is greater
at low shielding, which can also be seen in Fig. 4(a) as
the center of mass moves back towards the geometrical
center of the dot when  increases from 1.2 to 4.0. At
the same time the larger  yields much higher amplitude
outside the QD - a result of stronger barrier lowering and
the asymmetry due to the IPT outside the QD. In the
lower panel of Fig 4(b), we see that a small peak in the
wavefunction forms within the IPT at higher . Increas-
ing  further eventually leads to full localization within
this region, but at that point our model would lose its
physical meaning.

We see here that there is a competition between local-
ization within the QD volume and within the IPT, both
of which increase with . It is the mass of the particle
that determines which of these effects wins. The inter-
mediate regime of the two competing effects occurs when
the Bohr radius, 4πε02e−2(b/m), matches the length
scale of the IPT.

The basic effect of the effective mass on localization is
discussed and illustrated in the next section (also Fig. 6
below), and it can be briefly stated as follows. At low
m, we expect less localization within both the QD and
the IPT. At higher m, which is still small enough for
significant amplitude outside the QD volume, partial lo-
calization in the IPT would increase, which would raise
the tunneling rate due to the larger amplitude close to the
junction. On the other hand, for sufficiently large m, ψD
would become either highly localized inside the QD vol-
ume, or completely within the IPT. Therefore, focusing
on the volume states at first, the tunneling rate would be
expected to decrease beyond a certain m. This suggests
that a maximum in tunneling rates must exist, which is
confirmed by the calculations below. If we also consider
raising , the deeper IPT is able to sustain the upward
trend in tunneling rates up to larger m, and would thus
push the maximum to larger m, and saturate the rates
as a result of complete trapping on the surface. The lat-
ter case is beyond the present model and must include
atomic scale contributions to the potential.

B. Tunneling rates

We now discuss calculations of tunneling rates for the
ground QD states at low barriers (1.0 and 1.5 eV), and
for both the lowest and excited states at high barriers
(4.5 eV). The low barriers are chosen mainly to illustrate
how the physical intuition gained in the previous sub-
section affects tunneling, while the high barrier cases are
more realistic. Note that one can always consider higher
energy states to effectively reduce the barrier height, but
as discussed below, this leads to complicated profiles of
wavefunctions and obscures the trends that exist for the
lowest states.

where thick circle marks the QD boundary, and (b)
along the dotted line. In each case, b = 2.5, m = 0.4,

and Vb = 0.8 eV.

1. Low barriers

Figures 5-7 show plots of γ0 as a function of the ef-
fective mass of the particle at low and high values of ,
where the figures correspond to barrier heights (in eV)
of 1.5, 1.0, and 0.6 respectively. In each figure the value
of barrier dielectric constant is b = 2.5, and the effec-
tive mass in the barrier is mb = 1. We calculated the
rates assuming an isotropic parabolic energy band within
the electrode surface having an effective mass of 0.067,
which roughly mimics the conduction band of GaAs30.
The rates would scale in magnitude for different density
of states for the electrode, as was discussed previously.
In Fig. 5, Vb and b are both high enough that any
partial localization in the IPT is suppressed. Recalling
our phenomenological expression (15) we find that at low
ratio,  = 1.2, the rate decays as β ≈ 1/2, and τ is given
approximately by an effective reduction in the junction
width due to the image plane of the QD. The deviation
in the trend is very slight when the matched electrode is
replaced by a metallic one. But the total rate increases by
two orders of magnitude due to the significant lowering
of the junction potential by the image potential of the

and the distance between the QD center and the

density of states at the electrode, which is taken here to

be that of the conduction band of GaAs (parabolic

electrode.

However, when  increases to 4 and beyond, as in pan-
els (c) and (d), the trend also becomes closer to β ≈ 1.
This is essentially the regime where heavy particle is re-
pelled by the self energy barrier inside the QD much more
effectively than the localization by the IPT.

When we lower the barrier height to 1.0 eV a qualita-
tive change occurs as shown in Fig. 6(d) for  = 8: the
escape rate is increasing instead of decreasing with an
increasing effective mass. In fact, there is a maximum at
m = 0.85 beyond which the rate decreases slowly. This
result is the numerical example supporting the discussion
at the end of the previous section where we argued that,
for sufficiently deep IPTs, the escape rate can increase
with mass, or show a maximum.

When the Vb and b are both large enough that the
effect of IPT on the wavefunction is negligible, we ex-
pect the dependence of γ0 on m to follow that of the
energy of the lowest state. This can be understood from
the binomial expansion of
(12), which gives log γn ≈
d√2mbVb(1 − ∆En/(2Vb)), where d is an effective junc-
tion width and ∆En is the energy measured from the
bottom of the QD potential well. In Fig. 8 we plot the
energy of the lowest state with respect to the bottom
of the potential well as a function of effective mass for
three barrier heights. Comparison of the plots in this
figure, with those in Figures 5, 6, and 7 shows that the
trend of monotonically decreasing log γ0 coincides with
that of the energy E0 of the QD state. Thus we see that
for tunneling, the barrier potential is an important pa-
rameter determining the significance of the interplay of

low barrier height of 0.6 eV. The remaining parameters

are the same as those in Fig. 5.

electrostatic self energy and effective mass. The barrier
dielectric is also significant as it scales the magnitude self
energy within the barrier.

The most striking result above is a crossover in the de-
pendence of tunneling rate on the effective mass - switch-
ing from decreasing with m to increasing as the barrier
height is lowered. In order to visualize the extent of this
crossover, we plot in Fig. 9 the tunneling rate as a func-
tion of mass for a range of barrier potentials and a di-
electric matched as well as a metallic electrode. The ex-
istence of crossover can be clearly identified in the figure
on the right side.

2. High barriers

It appears from the previous calculations that a po-
tential energy of 1 eV yields a sufficiently high confine-
ment to suppress any interesting behavior such as the
crossovers in the tunneling rates. However, in these cal-

In systems, such as
in emerging photovoltaics, the barrier is much closer to a
vacuum than to a solid state material, even when QDs in
these systems are passivated by organic solvents with low
refractive index. In the case of vacuum, the self energy
in the barrier increases by almost a factor of 3 compared
to its value in the previous calculations, and accounting
for both the overall scaling and the increased  for a fixed
QD material. This allows the crossover phenomenon to
exist for barrier heights of up to 4-5 eV, which are roughly
the work functions of the semiconducting QD materials.
In Fig. 10, we plot the tunneling rates over the plane
defined by (b, m) at a fixed  = 8.0.
In the absence
of image effect by the electrode (left plot), the rate de-
creases with mass at all b, and the decrease becomes
more rapid as b increases. However, in the presence of
the metallic electrode (right plot), the rate crosses over
from decreasing to increasing with mass as b → 1 from
above. In fact, as b decreases, the rate first exhibits a
weak maximum, characteristic of the competing effects
of localization inside and outside the QD volume, as was
discussed previously. The slow rates in these figures are
due to the low density of states (DOS) in the electrode
model, and as noted earlier, they would be scaled sig-
nificantly with metallic DOS, and thinner barriers, but
without much effect on tunneling rates.

Finally, we remark that the trends with respect to ef-
fective mass also occur for higher energy states. As an
example, we show in Fig. 11 the rates for the second
lowest state in the present system. We note for a fixed
 and m, there is no substantial difference in the rates
with a dielectric matched or a metallic electrode. This
is due to the fact that the states involved are deep, and
therefore the wavefunction amplitude in the junction is
small compared to its values inside the QD. However the
effect of the electrode is similar to that in the lowest

Figure 8: Energies of the lowest QD, referenced to the

bottom of the well, and for the barrier heights

indicated. As in Figures 5-7 the values of  are 1.2 in
the upper row and 4.0 in the lower row. The remaining
parameters are as the same as those in Fig. 5. Energies
at  = 8.0 are not included for clarity and follow similar

trends as those at 4.0.

state, with the characteristic increasing tunneling rate
with respect to effective mass inside the QD. The impor-
tant difference between the two cases is that the rate for
higher state shows a minimum rather than a maximum.
However the simple interpretation for the trends in the
lowest, nodeless, state does not carry over to the excited
states directly. This is because the nodes in the excited
states act as extra degrees of freedom that determine the
wavefunction amplitudes.

At even higher energy, especially close to the top of
the potential well of the QD, the wavefunction acquires
a large number of nodes, with a spatial scale reaching
below the spatial scale of the image potential. The rates
then fluctuate heavily due to the nodal planes moving
across the IPT as  is varied. Thus no obvious trends can
be found in this energy range. In addition, microscopic
contributions to the potential must be computed in this
regime to obtain a robust and reliable trend.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have presented an exact solution to
the electrostatic potential of a point charge in a quan-
tum dot lying close to a planar surface. We have found
that at low barrier heights (less than 1 eV) there is a
significant competition between localization of the par-
ticle within the volume of the QD and its localization
within the surface trap formed by the image potential
at the QD surface. This leads to interesting behavior of
the tunneling rate as a function of effective mass, even
reversing the trend for larger dielectric contrast between

At lower barrier di-
electric constant, this trend continues to exist for much
higher barriers of up to 4.5 eV.

While the geometry of our model

is idealized, the
trends may continue to be important in absence of sig-
nificant geometric perturbations such as protrusions or
surface states that may introduce entirely new degrees
of freedom relevant to the problem at hand. The ba-
sic competition between volume and surface localization
will continue to exist in more complex quantum dots as
well, and our confirmation of its basic consequences in
an idealized model is an important guide to what may
occur in those cases. Thus ours is a useful model for an
initial attack on a design problem, or an analysis of an
experiment in tunneling devices.

The image effects illustrated here can also be imple-
mented into more complete models at the expense of ad-
ditional computational effort. The simple model used
here can be generalized to treat two charges, allowing
the analysis of the influence of the junction on excitons
in a QD. In some cases, the optical dipole moment itself
may result from the image force, in which case the mul-
tipole fields included here become essential. Finally, the
polarization effects discussed here can play an important
role in other Coulomb interaction induced phenomena,
such as Fermi edge singularity effects in optically excited
QDs in close proximity to an electrode31.

Appendix A: Multipole moments

13

In this appendix, we derive the multipole moments, Qlm that appear in the self energy and the two-particle potential
in Sec. II. As shown in Fig. 1, the origin of the cylindrical coordinate system is at the center of the QD. We expand
the first two terms of (2) in terms of spherical harmonics, and use the mathematical results on the re-expansion of
spherical harmonics with a shifted origin24 to re-write the last term of that equation. The basic relation we use is
obtained from Eq. 10 of Caola24, and using the relationships,

On the right hand side, we relabeled the index n as l when substituting (A1). The relabeling makes this term take
the form of a coefficient times Ylm(r), as in the case with the remaining three terms of (2).

For a charge inside the QD, s < r < a−, we take the derivatives of the of potential Φ, defined in (2) inside and
outside the QD boundary to obtain the displacement field perpendicular to the QD surface. The Maxwell boundary
conditions then imply that the components of the displacement field normal to the surface are equal,

lQl(cid:48)m(s) (−1)l

Anticipating constant values of q(s) inside and outside the QD, we have set here qi as the value of q(s) inside the
QD. The factor a2 in the above equations results from differentiating factors such as rl/al+1, and then setting r = a,
which results in 1/a2. The terms with Qlm contain an extra 1/a in front of the series, and differentiation is done for
rl/al, yielding 1/a, which combined with the 1/a in front of the series also gives 1/a2. When we subtract the second
equation from the first, we obtain zero on the left hand side by boundary conditions, and thus the coefficient of each
Ylm on the right hand side must vanish. We get,

The first term in the right hand side of this equation defines the Q(0)
third term, and the coefficients of Qlm on the left hand side define the matrix elements Am
in Sec. II to write the expressions for Σ and Φ.

Appendix B: Self energy regularization

When we put r = s in Φ(r; s), the resulting formula has two terms arising from the zeroth order contribution Q(0),

where one term is for s < a and the other for s > a. They can both be written in a single expression as,

∞(cid:88)

ρ2l,

[( + 1) l + 1]

l=0

where β = 1 corresponds to s < a and β = 0 to s > a, (with prefactors not relevant here). In each of the two cases,
the series at large l becomes a harmonic series and therefore divergent. To isolate the divergent terms, we re-write
the above series as

The coefficient of the ρ2l term in the first sum on the right hand side of B1 is,

which behaves as 1/l at large l, unless we set the coefficient of l in the numerator equal to zero. This condition
determines the value of α and yields α = β ( + 1) − 1. The numerator is then  [β ( + 1) − 1]. Thus
