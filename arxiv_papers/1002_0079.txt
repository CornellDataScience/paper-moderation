Abstract. A novel conductance oscillation in a twisted quantum ring composed of
a helical atomic configuration is theoretically predicted. Internal torsion of the ring is
found to cause a quantum phase shift in the wavefunction that describes the electron's
motion along the ring. The resulting conductance oscillation is free from magnetic flux
penetrating inside the ring, which is in complete contrast with the ordinary Aharonov-
Bohm effect observed in untwisted quantum rings.

Flux-free conductance modulation in a helical Aharonov-Bohm interferometer

1. Introduction

The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is a pivotal manifestation of geometric phase governing
quantum dynamics [1].
It occurs when a charged particle travels along a coherent
loop threaded by external magnetic flux; the particle's wave function acquires an
additional quantum phase that influences an interference pattern. Experimental efforts
to confirm its topological nature [2, 3] as well as possible applications toward quantum
computations [4, 5] have made it a topic of more broader interest than ever [6, 7].

The AB effect was originally predicted for charged particles moving around
magnetic flux. Since then, it has been generalized to neutral particles having magnetic
[8, 9, 10] or electric [11, 12] dipole momenta that travel around a line of electric
or magnetic charges, respectively. A unified picture for the three phenomena was
established in the framework of the electromagnetic duality, which further predicted
another interference phenomenon called the dual AB effect [13]. It is noteworthy that the
AB effect has many analogues; in fact, light penetrating through an optical medium [14],
quasiparticles moving in Bose-Einstein condensates [15, 16, 17, 18], and particles in a
gravitational background [19, 20, 21] have been suggested to exhibit AB-like phenomena.
In addition, recent attempts to reveal the Dirac fermion dynamics in the AB ring [22]
and to unveil the ponderomotive AB effect driven by laser pulses [23] are quite intriguing.
The series of work evidences the relevance of the effect to diverse fields in physics.

In the present paper, we propose a distinct class of the AB-like interference effect
for non-interacting charged particles that moves along a helical circuit, i.e., a quantum
ring consisting of helical atomic structure. Surprisingly, the effect requires no magnetic
flux threading inside the ring, which is in complete contrast to the ordinary AB effect.
Such the flux-free interference effect originates from a torsion-induced vector potential
Aeff that appears in the effective Hamiltonian describing the particle's motion along the
helical circuit [24, 25, 26]; a similar torsion-induced effect was found in twisted optical
waveguides [27]. We demonstrate that an additional phase associated with Aeff results
in a conductance oscillation whose pattern is determined by the helicity of the atomic
configuration.

2. Basic equation and electronic eigenstates

We consider a twisted quantum ring that has the ring radius R1 and a uniform
circular cross section with the tube radius R2 (≪ R1). The ring is composed of a
helical atomic configuration around the centroidal axis C parametrized by q0. Using
an appropriate reference frame (q0, q1, q2), a point in the vicinity of C is represented
by R = r(q0) + q1e1(q0) + q2e2(q0), where the set (e0, e1, e2) with e0 ≡ ∂0R and
e1 = e2 = 1 forms a right-handed orthogonal triad and ∂a ≡ ∂/∂qa (a = 0, 1, 2).
The vectors e1 and e2 rotate along C with the same rotation rate as that of helical
atomic configuration, as a result of which the torsion, τ ≡ e2 · ∂0e1, of the reference
frame equals the internal torsion of the atomic configuration. Such the twisted reference

were experimentally fabricated [28, 29] or theoretically suggested [30, 31, 32, 33, 34].

Here, uj(q1, q2) are N-fold eigenfunctions in the cross section ‡ and ψ(q0) describes the

The angular brackets h· · ·i in equation (7) indicate to take an expectation value with
respect to the two-dimensional ground-state function in the cross section. We see from
equation (7) that the product τhLi/¯h plays a role of the effective vector potential Aeff
we have mentioned earlier. Hence, nonzero values of τ and hLi are expected to yield a
quantum phase shift in the wavefunction ψ(q0), which originates from the helical atomic
configuration in the ring. If the ring has non-uniform cross section, equation (7) contains
a spatially dependent scalar potential that stems from the geometric curvature of the
cylindrical surface of the ring [38, 39, 40, 41]. This potential, nevertheless, requires no
qualitative revision in the conclusion of this paper.

To obtain a finite hLi, we suppose an external current Iext that penetrates through

limit of Iext → +∞ (or −∞). Furthermore, the decay in hLi is steep only within the
region −5 < Iext/I0 < 5. These features of hLi imply that the torsion-induced phase
shift τhLiℓ/¯h shows a significant response to the change in Iext when Iext lies within the
region above. The flux-free interference effect in a helical circuit is a direct consequence
of the torsion-induced phase shift, as demonstrated later.

3. Electron interferometer with a twisted quantum ring

Let us consider the conductance of a twisted-ring based interferometer measured by two
terminals, as illustrated in figure 1. Two different paths connecting the two points P
and Q have the same length of πR1. The electron's path along two semi-infinite leads
and the two semicircular arcs is parametrized by x such that x = 0 at P and x = πR1
at Q; electron flow inserted from x = −∞ bifurcates at P, passing through either of the
two branches (i.e., semicircles of the ring) until getting confluent at Q, and then flow
away toward x = +∞.

The wave functions ψs(s = 1, 2, 3, 4) corresponding to the four different regions

depicted in figure 1 are given by [44]

ψ1(x) = A1eikx + B1e−ikx,
ψ2(x) = A2ei(k+a)x + B2e−i(k−a)x,
ψ3(x) = A3ei(k−a)x + B3e−i(k+a)x,
ψ4(x) = A4eikx.

(11)

Here, k is the wavenumber of the incident electron, and a ≡ τhLi/¯h is a wavenumber
shift caused by Iext.

The wavefunctions ψs satisfy the connection conditions: ψ1 = ψ2 = ψ3 and
∂xψ1 = ∂xψ2 + ∂xψ3 at P, and ψ4 = ψ2 = ψ3, ∂xψ4 = ∂xψ2 + ∂xψ3 at Q. Applying
the conditions to equation (11), we obtain the conductance G of the system by using

with the notations θ1 = exp(−ikℓ), θ2 = exp(iaℓ) and ξ ′(k, a) = ξ(k,−a) for ξ = α, β, γ.
Once determining the dimensionless parameters kℓ and aℓ (or equivalently, kℓ, τ ℓ and
hLi/¯h), we can evaluate G by using equations (12)-(14). If we impose a = 0 in equation
(14), the expression of G reduces to that of an ordinary un-twisted interferometer [44]

To make concise arguments, we omit the electron's spin-dependent transport [46] nor
impurities/structural disorder [47] in the system, though each of them is expected to
yield interesting consequences similarly to the case of un-twisted systems.

4. Results

region (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Iext(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Figures 3 and 4 show the plots of the dimensionless conductance G ≡ G/(2e2/h) as
a function of the dimensionless current Iext ≡ Iext/I0 for various values of τ ℓ and kℓ.
In figure 3 (or figure 4), we fix kℓ = 1.0 (or τ ℓ = 1.0) and choose several values of
τ ℓ (or kℓ) as indicated. In both figures, the curves of G exhibit waveforms within the
< 5 but smooth (or almost constant) behaviors outside the region: The two
contrasting features of G in the two regions are attributed to the nonlinear response in
hLi to Iext, which will be discussed soon later.

The most important observation in figure 3 is an oscillation in G for large τ ℓ,
which does not take place in figure 4. This conductance oscillation is what we call
the flux-free interference effect, the peculiar phenomenon to the twisted-ring based
AB interferometer. The magnitude of oscillation can be enhanced (i.e., the oscillation
period is shortened) by increasing τ ℓ, since the larger τ ℓ results in the larger torsion-
induced phase shift τhLiℓ/¯h. What value of τ ℓ should be required for observing the
flux-free conductance oscillation strongly depends on the condition of kℓ we choose.
When kℓ = 1.0, for instance, the oscillation disappears for τ ℓ ≪ 10.0 as shown in figure
3. An exhaustive study covering wide ranges of the parameter space makes clear the
required values of τ ℓ and kℓ, which will be given elsewhere.

It is also noteworthy that the conductance oscillation in the present system is not
periodic against the variation in Iext, which differs from the ordinary AB effect driven by

penetrating magnetic flux. The non-periodic character is a consequence of the nonlinear
dependence of hLi on Iext (see equation (10) and figure 2). We have seen from figure
2 that hLi decreases steeply with increasing Iext around Iext ∼ 0 (at Iext ≫ 0) and it
decreases gently at the regions of Iext ≫ 0. This means that the phase shift τhLiℓ/¯h
shows sensitive (insensitive) response to a change in Iext at Iext ∼ 0 (Iext ≫ 0), and
thus it reaches 2π by only a small (very large) increase in Iext at Iext ∼ 0 (Iext ≫ 0).
As a result, the conductance oscillates densely (sparsely) at Iext ∼ 0 (Iext ≫ 0) since
the oscillation stems from the quantum interference caused by the phase shift τhLiℓ/¯h.
As a by-product, we show in figure 4 the Iext-dependence of G for a fixed τ ℓ
(τ ℓ = 1.0) and various kℓ. At kℓ ≪ 1.0, a sharp peak arises at Iext = 0 whose peak
width broadens gradually with increasing kℓ. The peak height at Iext = 0 is given

Flux-free conductance modulation in a helical Aharonov-Bohm interferometer

by equation (15), thus it oscillates with increasing kℓ. When kℓ exceeds 1.0, then G
becomes almost constant over the range of Iext we have considered, and it shows a slight
hollow at Iext = 0. The almost constant behavior of G(Iext) indicates that the torsion-
induced phase shift gives little contribution to the motion of electrons whose energies
are large enough to satisfy kℓ ≥ 1.0.

5. Discussions

We remark that the numerical results in figures 3 and 4 are based on the presence of
Iext that threads the center of the ring. An experimental realization of such the setup
may not be feasible in a straightforward manner, since the ring radius R1 should be
small enough to keep the quantum coherence of mobile electrons. Still, we can build an
equivalent setup to the above by applying an external magnetic field Bext, instead of
Iext, to a portion of the ring in a tangential direction. This is because the tangential field
Bext engenders nonzero hLi in the cross section and thus a phase shift in ψ(q0). A field
strength of B0 ∼ 10T is required to observe the flux-free interference effect, provided
the ring of the cross-sectional radius R2 ∼ 10nm; we can estimate it from the relations
of B0 = µ0I0/ℓ = m∗ωp/e and ¯hωp ∼ m∗ω2
2/2 (see Sec. 2). This field strength is
accessible in the existing nanometric measurements, thus supporting an experimental
feasibility of our results.

pR2

It is noticed that our attention has been limited to non-interacting electrons. When
taking into account a Coulomb interaction between electrons, the amplitude of the
conductance oscillation is expected to decrease to a degree. In fact, such the amplitude
reduction caused by the Coulomb interaction was experimentally observed for un-twisted
AB interferometers [48, 49], where sizeable interference patterns still remained to be
obtained. A further interesting issue would be transport properties of the Tomonaga-
Luttinger liquid (TLL) state in an AB interferometer. In one-dimensional systems, the
slightest correlation between electrons can lead to the TLL states, a highly collective
state of matter [50]. Recent studies have revealed that the conductance of TLL-based
AB interferometers shows anomalous interference patters that are substantially different
from those of the ordinary (non-interacting) AB system [51, 52]. These facts pose a
question as to what happens in the helical AB interferometer composed of the TLL
states, which requires establishing newly the bosonization theory for a twisted quantum
wire.

6. Conclusion

We theoretically predicted a non-trivial conductance oscillation in a twisted quantum
ring that is free from threading magnetic flux. Helical atomic configuration inside the
ring gives rise to a phase shift in the electron's eigenstates by τhLiℓ/¯h, where τ the
internal torsion of the ring, hLi the angular momentum expectation value in the cross
section, and ℓ the ring perimeter. The phase shift induces the flux-free conductance

oscillation in response to a change in the external current Iext or a tangential magnetic
field Bext, in which neither Iext nor Bext yields magnetic flux threading the ring. Our
results suggest untouched quantum nature in actual low-dimensional nanostructures
composed of helical atomic configuration.
