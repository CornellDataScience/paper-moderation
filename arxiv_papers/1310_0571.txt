We study the spin edge states, induced by the combined effect of Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit,
Zeeman interactions and inhomogeneous magnetic field, exposed perpendicularly to two-dimensional
electron systems. We calculate analytically the spectrum of the spin edge states (the spin snakes
orbits) in systems where the magnetic field exhibits a discontinuous jump in the transverse direction
and changes its sign at the magnetic interface. The obtained magnetic spin edge states in a 2DES
exhibit several interesting properties: in particular, electrons reverse their propagation direction at
finite values of their momentum.

Investigations in semiconductor structures of reduced
dimensionality are frequently connected with the use of
a homogeneous magnetic field,1 which, in addition to the
lateral confinement, quantizes the carrier motion also
in the plane normal to the magnetic field.
In hybrid
ferromagnetic-semiconductor nanostructures (HFSN)2 a
more complex situation of an inhomogeneous magnetic
field is realized. The spatial modulation of the magnetic
field is achieved experimentally by depositing patterned
gates of superconducting or ferromagnetic materials on
top of heterostructures.2 -- 4 An alternative approach to
produce inhomogeneous magnetic fields is by varying the
topography of an electron gas.5 Theoretically it is found
that different functional magnetic field profiles induce di-
versity of magnetic edge states6 -- 13 with remarkable time-
reversal asymmetry.6,13

Recently, studies of the combined effect of Rashba SOI
and quantizing magnetic field on the carrier energy dis-
persions and the spin polarization properties as well as on
the spin Hall effect have attracted much attention.13 -- 22
The interplay between Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Zeeman
interactions in a magnetic field has been also studied.23,24
However, these works are mainly confined to the uniform
magnetic fields. Meanwhile, as shown in Ref. 25, an
inhomogeneous magnetic field can be used as an effec-
tive tool to manipulate electron spins, mainly to con-
trol spin polarized current, similar to the spin field-effect
transistor. Thus far, the efforts in this field are mainly di-
rected towards studying the effect of SOI controlled edge
transmission on the resistance of magnetic barriers.26 -- 29
A large spin polarization (∽ 95%) is found in these sys-
tems with the potential to use them as spin injectors in
spin-logic devices as well as magnetic sensors with ultra-
high density storages. In the present paper we investi-
gate the magnetic edge states and their transport prop-
erties in a 2DES, exposed to a normal inhomogeneous
magnetic field in the presence of SOI and the Zeeman
effect. We focus on the joint Rashba SOI and Zeeman ef-
fect and study the spectral and spin transport properties
of these spin interface states, their control by means of
combined effect of the SOI and inhomogeneous magnetic
field. Our study will be based on investigations of the

single-particle spectrum of the inhomogeneous magnetic
field induced edge states and their transport in 1D and
2D systems5,6,8 as well as we extend our previous study
for the semiinfinite system with Rashba SOI and homo-
geneous magnetic field, confined by the infinite potential
wall.14

We study the spin edge states, induced by the com-
bined effect of spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions and
a inhomogeneous magnetic field, exposed perpendicu-
larly to the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) in
(x, y)−plane. We assume that the 2DES resides in a
quantum well, formed in the (001) plane of a zincblende
semiconductor heterostructure, and consider the case of
double magnetic interfaces where the magnetic field ex-
hibits a discontinuous jump in the transverse x−direction
and changes its sign on the left- and the right-hand side
of the magnetic interface, located at at x = ±L/2. The
schematic view of the system is shown in Fig. 1(a). This
model can be described by an effective two-dimensional
Hamiltonian of the form

H = H0 + HSOI + HZ,

(1)

where the Hamiltonian of free particle in a quantizing

perpendicular magnetic field is H0 = (cid:16)~Π2/2m∗(cid:17) τ , the
Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) Hamilto-
nian HSOI = α (Πx σy − Πy σx) , and the Zeeman interac-
tion HZ = (gµB/2) ~σ · ~B. Here m∗ denotes the electron
effective mass. The electron kinetic momentum operator
~Π = ~P − (e/c) ~A where ~P = −i~∇ is the canonical mo-
mentum and the vector potential ~A is given by the inho-
mogeneous magnetic field though ~B = ~∇× ~A = Bz (x) z.
The unity matrix τ and the Pauli matrices σx, σy and
σz act in the pseudospin space. α is the Bychkov-Rashba
spin-orbit coupling constant, g is the Lande factor of elec-
tron and µB = e/2m0c is the Bohr magneton where m0
is the free electron mass. We have assumed that elec-
trons are confined to the lowest energy subband in the
z−direction.

express the energy E → (ν + 1/2) ωB in units of the
cyclotron energy, ωB ≡ eB0/m∗c, and the length
x → xlB/√2 in the magnetic length, lB ≡ pc/eB0. We
introduce also the dimensionless SOI coupling constant
γr = √2α/vB with the cyclotron velocity vB = m∗lB/,
the Zeeman interaction constant γz = gm∗µBc/e and
the dimensionless coordinate of the center of orbital ro-
tation X(ky) = √2kylB.

The system of equations in (2) has to be solved under
the boundary conditions χky (x) → 0 when x → ±∞.
In the absence of SOI and Zeeman effect, γz = 0 and
h± = 0, we obtain the solution in terms of parabolic
cylindrical functions, Dν (x) . In the presence of SOI we
search the solution of matrix equation (2) for x < L/2

as χ1ky (ξ) = a1Dµ (ξ) and χ2ky (ξ) = a2Dµ−1 (ξ) . Here
a1 and a2 are the x−independent spinor coefficients to
be determined by solving the system of equations ob-
tained from inserting this ansatz into Eq. (2). The in-
dex µ ≥ −1/2 in general differs from the index ν. Us-
ing the recurrent properties of the parabolic cylindrical
functions14 we obtain from Eq.(2) for x < L/2 two (non-

The dispersion equations from matching conditions (8)
and (9) are quadratic with respect to the parabolic cylin-
dric functions, therefore for a given band index, m, each
of the equations has two solutions, Esm (ky) , correspond-
ing to the nondegenerated magnetic edge states with the
spin s =↑ and ↓ . The dispersion equation arising from
(8) gives rise to the unusual spectrum of magnetic spin
edge states with the negative velocities,7,10,11 while the
dispersion equation form (9) gives the spectrum of the
spin edge states restricted by infinite potential wall.14

Here we carry out the actual calculations of the spec-
trum of spin edge states, carried by snake orbits along the
magnetic interfaces in a 2DES. In the presence of a per-
pendicular magnetic field, the efficiency of SOI is deter-
mined by the dimensionless coupling constant γr, which
are inversely proportional to the square root of the mag-
netic field strength, B0. We carry the actual calculations
for magnetic fields corresponding to the cyclotron split-
ting of about 5 K. In InAs, with m∗ = 0.026m0, such a cy-
clotron splitting is achieved for B0 = 0.1T and taking the
Rashba constant α ≈ 112.49mevA30 we haveγr = 0.45.

Using the value of Lande factor g = −15 for bulk InAs31
we calculate the Zeeman effect constant γz = −0.1. The
Rashba coupling constant can be changed by varying ex-
ternal electric field. To compare the systems with infi-
nite hard wall14 and the magnetic interface induced edge
states, we carry out our calculations for Rashba coupling
γr = 0.3 and the Zeeman coupling γz = 0.1.32 In Figs.
1(b) and 1(c) we plot the energy spectrum of spin edge
states, Esm (ky) , as a function of momentum ky (Fig.
1(b)), which we obtain by solving numerically the disper-
sion equations for γr = 0.3 and γz = 0.1. As it is shown
in Ref. 14, for the edge states confined by the infinite
potential wall with stronger effective SOI coupling the
energy spectrum shows well-pronounced anti-crossings.
In Fig. 1(c) we plot the symmetric mode of energy spec-
trum of spin snake states as a function of the effective
SOI coupling γr or, what is the same, versus B−1/2
for
γz = 0 and γz = 0.1 with the fixed value of the cen-
ter of orbital rotation X (ky) = 0. Dotted (dashed) and
dash-dotted (solid) curves correspond to spin-↑ and spin-
↓ states for γz = 0.1 (γz = 0.)It is seen from the figure
that the anticrossings are observed also in the presence of
Zeeman effect, moreover, depending on value of SOI cou-
pling constant or magnetic field, the Zeeman effect can
either increase or decrease the splitting of energy lev-
els. At low values of SOI coupling the splitting of energy
levels is mainly due to the Zeeman effect while for the
lower magnetic field SOI becomes dominant. From the
energy spectrum we calculate the corresponding group
velocities along y−direction, vsm (ky) = ∂Esm (ky) /∂ky,
(along x−direction vx = 0). As seen from the spectrum
there are two types of magnetic edge states, which al-
ternate each other. The lower located branches with the
quantum numbers n = 2m (m = 0, 1, 2, ...) have local
minima at some finite values of ky where they reverse
their velocity direction while the higher located states
with n = 2m + 1 show monotonic behavior in the whole
variation range of ky. The eigenstates with a negative ve-
locity have no classical counterpart while the eigenstates
with large absolute values of ky represent the classical
snake orbits.

types of branches coagulate from above and below to
the dispersionless Landau levels, labeled by the quantum
number m so that the eigenstates become the twofold de-
generated. The inclusion of SOI splits each of these two
branches with n = 2m and n = 2m + 1 into the spin up
(dashed curves) and down (solid curves) states so that
there are actually four spin snake states for ky → ∞
and two spin splitted but still twofold degenerated Lan-
dau levels for ky → 0. It is seen in Fig. 1(b) that the spin
splitting increases both with the main quantum number
m and with the absolute value ky of the snake state wave
number. This can result in the net spin current since at
the sufficiently high Fermi energies there are more spin
down than spin up current carrying states.

The probability densities for different spins and wave
vectors of the first two bands are shown in Fig. 2(a).
The probabilities for different spins and wave vectors are
different in two bands for the antisymmetric as well as
for the symmetric mode. This difference gives rise to a
spatial separation of the spin-↑ and spin-↓ states. The
difference of the probabilities appears even at the center
of the sample when the electrons are in the quasibulk
Landau levels. Further we carry out the actual calcula-
tions of the average components of spins

real, the y component of the spin vanishes identically,
Sy
sm (ky) = 0. Because in the quasibulk Landau states
electrons have no preferential direction in the (x, y) plane
of their cyclotron rotation14 at small values of ky when
electrons are far from the interfaces, the spins are mainly
aligned along z axes.The small splitting near the inter-
faces (Fig. 2(b)) is due to the Zeeman effect. In contrast
of monotonic behavior of the average spin components
for antisymmetric mode, the spin orientation of the sym-
metric mode shows small oscillations near the interfaces.
In the opposite limit of large ky , the edge channels are
formed and the spins are mainly aligned in x direction,
perpendicular to the y direction of electron propagation.
It is seen thatthe electron propagation direction in y axes
in left and right interfaces are opposite and the SOI aligns
the electrons in opposite directions in x axes (Fig. 2(c)).
One should note that due to the spin splitting the abso-
lute values of the average spin components do not equal
in the ↑ and ↓ states for antisymmetric as well as for the
symmetric modes and this asymmetry becomes stronger
with the band index m.

y (ky) and J z

In Fig. 3 we plot the x and z components of the
net spin current J x,z
(EF ) in y direction as a function
of the Fermi energy defined in Eq. (13). The dashed and
dash-dotted curves plot the antisymmetric and symmet-
ric modes, respectively. Because of the antisymmetric
behavior of the J z
y (ky) for any value of EF there are two
spin current contributions: J z
y (−ky) at dif-
ferent interfaces, which are opposite and the total spin
current is zero in all range of the Fermi energy. However,
in order to evaluate the z−spin current we calculate in
Fig. 3 for the case of single interface in the sample. It
is seen that both modes show monotonic behavior in all
range of the Fermi energy.
In contrast of the case of
the semiinfinite system,14there is very weak oscillation
in the net spin current of the antisymmetric mode in
the presence of the Zeeman effect. This is because the
Zeeman effect increase the splitting between ↑ and ↓ en-
ergy states in the bulk and the group velocity increases
more smoothly in the Fermi energy scale. However, there
are small oscillations in the symmetric mode of J x
y (EF ) .
These small peaks appear because of the unusual behav-
ior of the energy spectrum with the negative group veloc-
ities. As seen from Fig. 3 the z−spin current changes its
sign, in addition to its peaked behavior: due to the inter-
play between the average spin Sz
sm (ky) and the velocity
vsm (ky) . The peaks of the spin current have a period,
determined by the cyclotron energy, renormalized in the
presence of SOI and Zeeman effect. One can see from Fig.
3 that the main contribution to the total spin current is
due to the the symmetric modes. Thus, the introduction
of the magnetic interface enhances the the spin current
both for the J x

y (EF ) and J z

y (EF ) .

In Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) we plot the average spin compo-

In conclusion, we study spin edge states, induced by

5

the combined effect of Rashba spin-orbit and Zeeman
interactions and inhomogeneous magnetic field, exposed
perpendicularly to two-dimensional electron systems. We
calculate the spectrum of the spin edge states (the spin
snake orbits) in double-interface system and show that
the magnetic spin edge states reverse their propagation
direction at finite values of their momentum, what has
no classical counterpart.Depending on magnetic field, the
Zeeman effect can either increase or decrease the split-
ting of energy levels.
In the presence of double inter-
face the spin orintations of the electrons are opposite in
x−direction at the left and right interfaces. The contri-

bution of symmetric mode in total spin current is sev-
eral times higher then of the antisymmetric mode, which
means that the x and z component spin current along the
interface is much stronger then in the case of infinite po-
tential wall confinement,14 where only the antisymmetric
mode exists.
