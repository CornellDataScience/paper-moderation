The lifetime of localized surface plasmon plays an important role in many aspects of plasmonics
and its applications.
In small metal nanostructures, the dominant mechanism of plasmon decay
is size-dependent Landau damping. We performed quantum-mechanical calculations of Landau
damping for the bright surface plasmon mode in a metal nanoshell with dielectric core. In contrast
to the conventional model based on the electron surface scattering, we found that the damping rate
decreases as the nanoshell thickness is reduced. The origin of this behavior is traced to the spatial
distribution of plasmon local field in the metal shell. We also found that, due to the interference
of electron scattering amplitudes from the two nanoshell metal surfaces, the damping rate exhibits
pronounced quantum beats with changing shell thickness.

INTRODUCTION

any small system should have the form

Lifetime of localized surface plasmons (SP) in metal
nanostructures is one of the fundamental problems in
plasmonics that has been continuously addressed for
about 50 years [1 -- 5]. The importance of this issue stems
from one of the major objectives of plasmonics  --  gener-
ation of extremely strong local fields at the nanoscale.
The range of physical phenomena and applications re-
lated to this goal cuts across physics, chemistry, biology,
and device applications. A small sample of examples in-
cludes plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies of molecules or
semicinductor quantum dots near metal nanostructures,
such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) [6],
plasmon-enhanced fluorescence [7 -- 10], plasmon-assisted
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) [11 -- 14]
and plasmonic laser (spaser) [15 -- 20]. High Ohmic losses
in bulk metal due to strong electron-phonon interactions
impose limitations on the quantum yield of metal-based
plasmonic devices, which can, to some extent, be reme-
died by reducing the metal component size.

However, at the length scale below ∼ 10 nm, new limi-
tations on the SP lifetime and, consequently, on quantum
yield arise due to the quantum-size effects [1]. Among
those, the most important is the Landau damping (LD)
of SP  --  decay of SP into the Fermi sea electron-hole
pair [21 -- 31]. This process has been recently suggested
as an efficient way of hot carriers excitation in plasmon-
based photovoltaic devices [32 -- 42]. Starting with the pi-
oneering work of Kawabata and Kubo [43] for a spherical
nanoparticle (NP), quantum-mechanical calculations of
LD rate were performed, using random phase approxima-
tion (RPA) [43 -- 50] or density functional theory (DFT)
[51 -- 58] methods, for several NP shapes. Excitation of an
electron-hole pair with large optical frequency requires
momentum relaxation to satisfy the energy and momen-
tum conservation laws which, in small systems, can take
place via the electron surface scattering. Based on this
picture, it was suggested [59 -- 63] that the SP LD rate in

where vF is the electron Fermi velocity (hereafter we
set  = 1) and L is the effective mean free path of
ballistic electrons confined in a hard-wall potential well,
while the phenomenological constant A, measured in the
range 0.3−1.5 [1], accounts for surface potential, electron
spillover, and dielectric environment effects. Note that,
for nonspherical NPs, the SP damping by interband exci-
tations can complicate the LD size dependence. For ex-
ample, absorption spectra for gold nanorods [22, 27] and
nanoshells [23, 24] show overall narrowing of the SP reso-
nance that is redshifted away from the interband transi-
tions onset. At the same time, recent systematic studies
of scattering spectra of single silver nanoprisms [29], gold
nanorods [30], and gold nanodisks [31] revealed signifi-
cant discrepancies with Eq. (1), while no size-dependence
was detected for the SP resonance width of single gold
nanoshells [26], implying that LD is shunted by the bulk
SP damping even for relatively thin shells.

There is also a physical argument that renders Eq. (1)
invalid for nanostructures of general shape. Indeed, the
rate of electron-pair excitation by the SP local field must
be sensitive to the field distribution in the NP. Note that
for a solid sphere, the dipole SP electric field in the NP is
uniform and size independent, which is the reason Eq. (1)
holds well for spherical NPs in a very wide size range [1].
However, in the general case, the local field distribution
depends strongly on NP size or shape, so that the simple
picture implied by Eq. (1) fails. Below we demonstrate
that the effect of field distribution leads to a drastically
different size and shape dependence of the LD decay rate
in a nanostructure than that implied by Eq. (1).

In this paper, we present a quantum-mechanical cal-
culation of the LD rate for bright SP modes in a metal
nanoshell (NS) with a dielectric core. We find that, with
decreasing NS thickness d, the LD rate decreases as well,
in sharp contrast to the surface scattering model [59 -- 
63] predicting an increase of Γ as the effective mean free
path is reduced. Furthermore, for small overall NS sizes,
the SP LD rate exhibits quantum beats as a function of

shell thickness caused by the interference between elec-
tron scattering amplitudes from the inner and outer NS
boundaries.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we out-
line our approach and present a formal expression for the
LD rate in terms of the SP eigenmodes. In Sec. III we
describe the plasmon eigenmodes in metal NS with di-
electric core and evaluate the NS internal energy. In Sec.
IV, we evaluate the power dissipated through electron-
hole excitation by the SP eigenmodes. The calculated
LD rates are discussed in Sec. V, and Sec. VI concludes
the paper.

II. SURFACE PLASMON LANDAU DAMPING

RATE IN COMPOSITE METAL-DIELECTRIC

NANOSTRUCTURES

In this section we outline our approach for calcula-
tions of the plasmon damping rate in a composite metal-
dielectric structure embedded in a dielectric medium. We
assume that the structure is characterized by dielectric
function of the form ε(ω, r) = ε′(ω, r)+ iε′′(ω, r) and the
retardation effects are unimportant.
In the quasistatic
case, the plasmon eigenmodes, labeled by n here, are de-
termined by the Gauss's law

∇ · [ε′(ωn, r)En] = 0,

(2)

where ωn is the eigenfrequency, En = −∇Φn is the mode
local field, and Φn is the potential. In the following we
assume that only the metal dielectric function εm(ω) =
m(ω) + iε′′
ε′
m(ω) is complex and dispersive. The decay
rate of a plasmon mode is given by [64]

Γn = Qn/Un,

where Un is the mode energy [65],

eration of electron-hole pairs by the plasmon local field

that often in the literature, the plasmon surface-assisted
decay rate Γs

III. PLASMON MODES IN METAL

NANOSHELLS WITH DIELECTRIC CORE

Here we collect the relevant formulas for plasmonic
eigenstates in a spherical NS with inner and outer radii
R1 and R2, respectively, and core dielectric constant εc,
in a medium with dielectric constant εd (see inset in Fig.
1). In the quasistatic limit, the plasmonic eigenfunctions
in each region have the form ΦLM (r) = Φ(i)
L (r)YLM (r),
where r and r are the magnitude and orientation of
the radius vector with the origin at NS center, i =
(c, m, d) denotes core, metal and outside dielectric re-
gions, respectively, and YLM (r) are spherical harmon-
ics.
In each region, the eigenfunctions are superposi-
tions of two independent solutions of Laplace equation
in spherical coordinates, rLYLM (r) and r−L−1YLM (r).
The equation for eigenvalues is obtained by imposing
standard boundary conditions on the radial part of po-
tentials, Φ(i)
L (r), and radial component of electric field,

where alternating (±) sign correspond to bright and dark
plasmon modes, respectively. The bright plasmon spec-
trum matches that of a solid NP plasmon in the κ = 0
limit: εmd = Lε′
m + (L + 1)εd = 0. The higher frequency
dark plasmon mode couples weakly to the external fields
and will not be considered here.

In Fig. 1, we show the dependence of bright plasmon
mode frequency ω1 (for L = 1) on aspect ratio κ = R1/R2
of Au NS with several choices of core and outside di-
electrics. In all numerical calculations, the experimental
dielectric function for gold as well as for core and outside
dielectrics were used [68]. With decreasing shell thick-
ness, after a prolonged plateau for κ up to approximately
0.5-0.7 (depending on dielectric content), the frequency
develops a redshift. The inset shows electric field dis-
tribution for the dipole plasmon mode oscillating along
the z axis in a NS with κ = 0.7. Note that, in a thin
NS, the electric field of bright plasmon is mainly concen-
trated outside of the metal shell, in contrast to the field
distribution in a solid metal NP.

Note that the electric field orientations at the inner and
outer interfaces (on the metal side) are opposite.

Using the above eigenfunctions, the plasmon mode en-
ergy can be straightforwardly calculated from Eq. (4).
Since the eigenfunctions are harmonic functions inside
each region, the integral in Eq. (4) reduces to the bound-
ary terms, and, using the relations (17) between fields
and potentials at the interface, we obtain

The aspect ratio dependence of the bright dipole plas-
mon energy U1 normalized to solid NP plasmon energy

1 with the same overall size is plotted in Fig. 2. The
NS mode energy depends strongly on core and outside di-
electrics, but is largely comparable to that for a solid NP.
This is due to a somewhat similar distribution of the sur-
face charges for bright NS plasmon and solid NP plasmon
modes: In both cases, the opposite charges are located at
different hemispheres so the energy is proportional to the
core-shell particle volume. In contrast, for dark modes
(not shown here), the opposite charges are located at in-
ner and outer boundaries, so the energy vanishes as the
shell thickness decreases.

IV. POWER DISSIPATED BY PLASMON

MODES IN NANOSHELLS

We now turn to calculation of dissipated power Eq.
(9) (we drop superscript s in the following). We repre-
sent the NS confining potential as a three-dimensional
quantum well with hard boundaries at R1 and R2 and
amplitude V0: V (r) = V0θ(r − R1)θ(R2 − r). The role
of realistic surface potential and nonlocal effects will be
discussed later. The electron wave functions have the
form ψnl(r)Ylm(r), where n, l and m and electron radial,
angular momentum and magnetic numbers, respectively.
Due to spherical symmetry, the angular part factorizes
out and Eq. (9) takes the form

QL = πωL Xnn′ll′

The matrix element hαΦLMα′i in Eq.

is the angular contribution. The latter is nonzero only for
l = l′ ± L, and for typical l, l′ ≫ L, can be approximated
as aL

inated by the surface contribution, which can be ob-

Then, for infinitely high potential barrier (V0 → ∞),
matching the wave-functions across the well boundaries
gives √2mV0ψnl(Ri) ≈ −ψ′

The first and second terms in the r.h.s. describe excita-
tion, by the plasmon electric field, of a Fermi sea electron-
hole pair accompanied by momentum transfer to the in-
ner and outer boundaries, respectively. Correspondingly,
QL can be decomposed as QL = Q11

nl(R1) = −p4mpl(R1)/τl.

(27)

Since the plasmon energy ωL is much larger than the
spacing ǫ0 = vF /d between the energy levels with adja-
cent n (at fixed l) in a spherical well, the sums in Eq. (25)

can be replaced by the integrals, Pn → R dǫρl(ǫ) (with

ǫ < EF , ǫ′ > EF ), where ρl(ǫ) = ∂n/∂ǫnl is the par-
tial density of states related to the classical period as
ρl = τl/2π (see Appendix). The result reads

ǫ now changes in the interval (−ωL/2, ωL/2), and then
rescaled to x = ǫ/ωL. The sum over l is replaced by
the integral restricted by maximal value l ∼ pF R1 that
is determined by the condition pl(ǫ, R1) ≥ 0. After the
change of variables to s = l2/(pF R1)2, it contributes a

tribution into the r.h.s. of Eq. (25) comes from the terms

As ωL changes (e.g., with changing aspect ratio), the
relative parity of electron and hole states, separated by
energy ωL, changes too, leading to a different sequence of
alternating signs in the sum in Eq. (32) which, in turn, re-
sults in oscillations of Q12

The last term in Q12 oscillates as a function of shell thick-
ness d due to the interference of electron scattering ampli-
tudes from inner and outer NS boundaries. These oscil-
lations are, in fact, quantum beats caused by the change,
with d, of the number of electron levels with alternating
parities within the plasmon energy ωL (i.e., the differ-
ence between numbers of even and odd states oscillates
between 0 and 1). The oscillations period 2πvF /ωL de-
pends weakly on the shell thickness through dependence
of ωL on κ (see Fig. 1), and their amplitude slowly dies
out with increasing d.

In fact, the quantum beats of Q12 have a rather gen-
eral origin.
Indeed, excitation of an electron-hole pair
with energy ω is accompanied by momentum transfer
p0 ∼ ω/vF and occurs in a region with the size r0 ∼
vF /ω. Therefore, oscillations of the pair excitation rate
with changing D = d/r0 reflect the nonlocality of surface-
scattering mechanism of momentum relaxation.

In Fig. 3, normalized dissipated power for the bright
dipole plasmon mode Q1 is plotted vs. aspect ratio κ for
overall NS sizes R2 = 30 nm and R2 = 10 nm. Numeri-
cal calculations were performed using the full expression
(A.1) in the Appendix. While
for G(ξ) given by Eq.
for larger NS with overall size R2 = 30 nm, oscillations
of Q1 are relatively weak [see Fig. 3(a)], they become
more pronounced for smaller NS (R2 = 10 nm) [see Fig.
3(b)]. Note that, for smaller R2, the same values of κ
correspond to smaller shell thicknesses. Another striking
feature is the decrease of dissipated power for κ larger
than 0.4. The reason for this behavior is that, with de-
creasing shell thickness, the local field is pushed outside
the metal shell (see inset in Fig. 1) which, in turn, leads
to the reduction of the transition matrix element.

is the LD rate. Here qL = E1L/E2L is the electric fields'
ratio at the interfaces given by Eq. (18). In deriving Eq.
(38), we used the relation ω2
p = 4πn/m = 4p3
F /3πm (for
e = 1), where n is the electron concentration.

Equations (37) and (38) represent our central result.
Apart from the dimensional factor vF /R2, the LD rate
(38) is determined by the ratio of plasmon local fields
at the metal-dielectric interfaces qL. The last factor
describes the relative contribution of the NS interfaces
and includes the interference correction.
Importantly,
comparison of Eqs. (37) and (7) indicates that LD rate
can be incorporated into the Drude scattering rate as
γ = γ0 + γL, where γ0 is the bulk scattering rate, so the
full plasmon damping rate is still given by Eq. (7), but
with modified Drude dielectric function.

For solid NP (κ = 0), the plasmon eigenfrequency is
determined from Lεm(ωL)+(L+1)εd = 0, and we recover
the LD rate of the Lth mode in a spherical NP [43 -- 47],

In thin NSs, the electric field is pushed out of the metal
shell, leading to the reduction of electron-hole excitation
rate. For thin NS (d/R2 ≪ 1), the explicit dependence
of the LD rate on the shell thickness is obtained from Eq.
(38) as (for L = 1)

indicating a linear dependence on the shell thickness.

In Fig. 4, we show the calculated LD rate γ1 for the
bright dipole plasmon mode in gold NSs of overall sizes
R2 = 30 nm and R2 = 10 nm and several choices of core
and outside dielectrics. The rate shows approximately
linear decrease with increasing κ (i.e., decreasing d), con-
sistent with Eq. (40). The oscillations of γ1 are quite
pronounced for smaller overall NS size (R2 = 10 nm)
and could be observable for typical experimental range
of aspect ratios (0.6-0.8) provided that NS overall size is
sufficiently small, so that the LD is not shunted by the
bulk scattering. Note that these oscillations should be
distinguished from those observed in solid NP [51, 52, 57]
due to size-quantization of the electron energy levels in

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a confined nanostructure, while here they are quantum
beats between electron scattering paths from different NS
interfaces.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, let us discuss the role surface poten-
tial, dielectric environment and nonlocal effects near the
metal surface on the plasmon LD that was extensively
studied in solid NPs [51 -- 58]. These effects mainly af-
fects the overall magnitude of LD rates, but plays no
significant role in determining the LD dependence on the
nanostructure shape which, according to our findings, is
mainly determined by the local field ratio at the inter-
faces. Extensive theoretical and experimental studies of
spherical NPs indicate that surface effects mainly affect
the phenomenological constant A [see Eq. (1)], but the
overall 1/R dependence of the LD rate is unchanged [1].
In fact, the important role of local fields in plasmon LD
rate can explain the relatively wide range of measured
A (0.3-1.5 [1]), which raised questions about the validity
of the scattering model [56]. Indeed, as we mentioned in
Sec. IV, excitation of an e-h pair by plasmon local field
takes place in a surface layer of thickness r0 ∼ vF /ω. For
vF ≈ 1.4 × 106 m/s in Au and Ag, we have vF /ω ≈ 1
nm for ω = 1.0 eV, i.e., for typical plasmon frequencies
in the range 1.5-3.5 eV, the layer thickness is just a few
A. In a thin surface layer, the local fields are strongly
affected by the electron spillover and surface roughness
effects as well as by the dielectric environment, which can
lead to large variations of overall LD rate magnitude for
different samples and/or environments. Within our ap-
proach, the constant A can be estimated by computing
the effect of the above factors on the local field, which is,
however, out of the scope of this paper.

In summary, we calculated the Landau damping rate of
surface plasmons in metal nanoshells with dielectric core.
We found that the damping rate decreases with the shell
thickness due to the reduction of the local field magni-
tude inside a thin metal shell. We also found that the
Landau damping rate exhibits quantum beats caused by
the interference between electron scattering paths from
the nanoshell inner and outer metal-dielectric interfaces.

case, a straightforward evaluation yields Eq. (35).
