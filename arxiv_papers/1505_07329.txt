Abstract: 

Atomically thin two dimensional (2D) layered materials have emerged as a new 

class  of  material  for  nanoelectromechanical  systems  (NEMS)  due  to  their 

extraordinary mechanical properties and ultralow mass density.  Among them, 

graphene  has  been  the  material  of  choice  for  nanomechanical  resonator.  

However,  recent  interest  in  2D  chalcogenide  compounds  has  also  spurred 

research  in  using  materials  such  as  MoS2  for  NEMS  applications.    As  the 

dimensions  of  devices  fabricated  using  these  materials  shrink  down  to 

atomically  thin  membrane,  strain  and  nonlinear  effects  have  become 

important.  A  clear  understanding  of  nonlinear  effects  and  the  ability  to 

manipulate them is essential for next generation sensors. Here we report on all 

electrical actuation and detection of few layers MoS2 resonator. The ability to 

electrically detect multiple modes and actuate the modes deep into nonlinear 

regime enables us to probe the nonlinear coupling between various vibrational 

modes.  The  modal  coupling  in  our  device  is  strong  enough  to  detect  three 

distinct internal resonances. 

 

Sensors  made  of  nanoelectromechanical  devices  are  now  capable  of  measuring 

mass  of  individual  protein  molecules1,2  and  have  resolution  down  to  atomic  mass 

unit3. These devices are also fantastic tool to probe validity of continuum mechanics

at  atomic  thickness4,5,  study  nonlinear  dynamics6,7  and  gain  deeper  insight  into 

quantum mechanics8–10. Among the 2D materials employed for fabrication of these 

devices,    graphene  has  drawn  the  most  attention  and  has  been  extensively 

studied11–17.  However,  recent  theoretical  models  indicate  the  possibility  of  lower 

dissipation in other 2D materials such as MoS2

18. Furthermore, ultralow mass density 

of 3.3fg/µm2, high elastic modulus (Ey ≈ 0.3 TPa)19,20 and an exceptional strain limit 

of 10-12%20 make it an attractive alternative to graphene for NEMS applications. The 

strongly coupled mechanical and electro-optical properties of MoS2

21–23

 will also have 

implications  for  optomechanics  and  valleytronics24,25.  For  these  reasons  there  has 

been effort towards characterizing the properties of nanoelectromechanical devices 

made of MoS2

26–28

 . The experimental research reported till date has relied on optical 

detection  primarily  due  to  the  exquisite  sensitivity  to  motion  as  well  as  ability  to 

detect  multiple  modes  of  the  device.    However,  characterization  of  these  devices 

deep  into  the  nonlinear  regime  has  proven  difficult.  Furthermore,  integration  of 

optical  detection  scheme  for  application  is  cumbersome  and  an  all  electrical 

actuation and detection scheme would be desirable. In this report, we demonstrate 

all electrical actuation and detection of few layers MoS2 resonator. Similar to optical 

detection schemes, we are able to observe multiple vibrational modes of the device 

and  unlike  previous  reported  work  on  2D  materials  we  are  able  to  drive  these 

devices  deep  into  nonlinear  regime  to  observe  nonlinear  coupling.  Due  to  strong 

nonlinear  coupling  between  different  vibrational  modes,  we  also  observe  multiple 

internal resonances29–32. Although there has been one report of internal resonances 

in  microelectromechanical  system  (MEMS)32,  there  is  no  reported  evidence  of 

internal resonances in resonators made of  thin atomic membrane. The large strain 

observed  in  these  ultra-thin  devices  and  the  associated  strong  modal  coupling 

 

2 

observed in this work has major implication for sensing, novel low noise oscillators32 

and nonlinear dynamics33. 

The  device  used  in  this  study  is  a  few  layer  (bi-layer  or  tri-layer  based  on  the 

contrast)  MoS2  resonator.  The  fabrication  procedure  is  similar  to  other  published 

reports  of  ultrathin  resonators12,13  (See  SI).  The  highly  doped  silicon  substrate  is 

utilized  as  the  gate  for  the  actuation  of  the  device.    The  gate  capacitor  has 

approximately 150nm of air gap and about 140nm of silicon oxide.  Figures 1a and 

1b show optical image and electron micrograph of the device respectively. Electrical 

characterization of the suspended device yields a mobility of 9cm2/ V-s (See figure 

S1).  

In this work, we utilize three different transduction schemes, viz., 1) 1ω mixed down 

technique12,34, 2) 2ω mixed down technique34,35 and 3) Frequency Modulation (FM) 

technique36. All the three schemes are able to detect multiple vibrational modes of 

this ultrathin MoS2 nanoresonator and show a fundamental resonance frequency of 

about  41.8MHz  and  quality  factor  of  about  600  (figure1c).  The  measurements 

reported in this paper are performed at room temperature and vacuum levels below 

10-7Torr. 

Figure 2 shows the various resonant modes of the device detected using the three 

different transduction schemes. In addition to the mechanical resonance, we observe 

a  number  of  electrical  background  peaks  in  1ω and 2ω mixed  down  detection 

schemes. The peaks are identified as mechanical if nonlinear response is observed. 

For peaks below 100MHz, we are able to actuate the resonator deep into nonlinear 

regime  in  all  the  actuation  schemes  mentioned  above.  For  peaks  above  100MHz, 

 

3 

none of the actuation schemes is strong enough to drive the modes non-linear; we 

rely on the ability of FM technique to pick only the mechanical resonances36. 

Table 1 gives the list of all the mechanical resonances  that are observed with the 

three techniques. In this work we are unable to associate the higher frequencies with 

mode  shapes  and  as  such  use  the  nomenclature  1st  mode  for  the  first  observed 

mechanical  resonance  (41MHz),  2nd  mode  for  70MHz  resonance  and  so  on. 

Atomically  thin  suspended  membrane  fabricated  using  the  so  called  -  scotch  tape 

method typically have large strain11–13. The strain affects the resonant frequency and 

nonlinear coefficients of the device and thus the nonlinear coupling between different 

modes of the device. To estimate the intrinsic strain of the device, we measured the 

frequency of 1st mode of the device as a function of back gate voltage and calculated 

the intrinsic strain and mass loading on the device17 (see figure S5). Based on the 

fitting  of  the  experimental  data  the  strain  is  estimated  to  be  approximately 10−2 

(assuming the device to be bilayer) at room temperature.  

Unlike  the  electrical  measurements  of  graphene  resonators  reported  to  date,  the 

ability  to  observe  multiple  modes  and  high  strain  makes  it  attractive  to  study 

nonlinear coupling between various vibrational modes. These devices can be driven 

into nonlinear regime by relatively modest electrostatic forces due to their atomically 

thin nature. Because of the presence of the electrostatic gate, the nonlinear driven 

resonant  mode  can  be  described  by  asymmetric  Duffing  oscillator  equation  given 

by29 

 

𝑥 + 2𝜁𝑥+𝜔0𝑛2𝑥+𝛼2𝑥2+𝛼3𝑥3=𝐹𝑚 cos (ω𝑡) 

 

(1)

Where, 𝜁 is the damping ratio, 𝜔0𝑛 is the resonant frequency of the nth mode, α2 and 

α3 are the quadratic and cubic nonlinearity coefficients and F is the drive force. 

Figure 3a shows the response  of the  1st mode of  device as the drive amplitude is 

increased.  The  initial  Lorentzian  shape  is  quickly  driven  to  nonlinear  regime  with 

critical  amplitude  of  about  7nm  at  dc  gate  voltage  (Vg

DC)  of  15V  (See  figure  S6). 

Beyond  the  linear  regime,  the  device  shows  the  hardening  nonlinear  response. 

However,  for  extremely  large  drives  corresponding  to  about  5-22  times  the  force 

required at critical amplitude, we observe signatures of nonlinear mode coupling for 

two distinct actuation drive ranges.  For all ac drive voltages (Vg

AC) between 0.3V to 

1.25V,  the  downward  jump  during  the  forward  frequency  sweep  remains  fixed  at 

42.032MHz  (see  figure  3b  and  3d).  For  drive  level  above  1.25V  we  observe  two 

features, viz., i) a dip appears at 42.032MHz  (red arrow in figure  3c and SI figure 

S7b) and ii) the downward jump is now fixed at 43.12MHz. Figure 3d shows the peak 

amplitude and position of the frequency jump as a function of the drive voltages. The 

two  distinct  plateaus  observed  both  in  the  peak  amplitude  as  well  as  the  jump 

frequency  point  (upper  to  lower  branch)  correspond  to  two  distinct  internal 

resonances. Internal resonances are likely to occur in systems with large nonlinear 

mode couplings  leading to spillover of the energy pumped into one mode to other 

vibrational  modes29.  The  plateau  width  spanning  approximately  one  decade  of  ac 

drive indicates an internal resonance that is extremely stable against drive amplitude 

fluctuations. In presence of coupling between two vibrational modes, the equation for 

the nonlinear driven mode can be written as 

𝑥1+ 2𝜁𝑥1+𝜔012𝑥1=𝐹𝑚cos(ω𝑡)+𝛽(𝑥1,𝑥2)−𝛼2𝑥12−𝛼3𝑥13 

(2)

Where, β    is  the  coupling  constant  that  is  a  function  of  displacement  of  the  two 

right  hand  side  have  components  at  2ω  and 3ω.  If  the  higher  mode  satisfies  the 

modes 𝑥1 and 𝑥2. The nonlinear coefficient terms that have been rearranged on the 
condition 𝜔02≈2𝜔01 𝑜𝑜 𝜔02≈3𝜔01 , these terms can provide the energy to drive the 

higher modes leading to internal resonance29.   

To verify the coupling between different vibrational modes we actuate the first mode 

at a constant drive voltage. The drive frequency of the first mode is then varied in 

steps while driving and monitoring the frequency response of the 5th mode. The drive 

amplitude of the 5th mode was maintained to ensure moderate signal to noise levels 

for this mode but still well below its nonlinear limit.  Figures 4a-c show the frequency 

response of the 1st mode for 3 different drive forces. Figure 4a in linear regime, 4b in 

nonlinear  regime  corresponding  to  first  plateau  and  4c  in  nonlinear  regime 

corresponding to second plateau. Figures 4d-f show the frequency shift observed in 

mode 5 for the corresponding drives of mode 1 shown in figure 4a-c. In all cases, the 

resonant  frequency  shift  of  mode  5  closely  follows  the  amplitude  of  the  1st  mode 

indicating the amplitude dependent tension as the source of coupling37,38.  

The  observed  strong  coupling  and 

the  associated  plateaus  observed  are 

characteristics of internal resonances. The 1:2 internal resonances are predicted to 

occur  in  systems  with  quadratic  nonlinearity  and  with  modes  such  that  one 

vibrational  mode  has  resonant  frequency  that  is  close  to  twice  the  resonant 

frequency of another mode29. For our device  𝜔04,05≈2 𝜔01. The 1st mode goes into 

internal  resonance  with  these  two  vibrational  modes  at  two  different  drive  levels 

leading  to  two  plateaus  shown  in  figure  3d.  To  check  the  possibility  of  mode  1 

 

6 

coupling to other vibrational modes, we performed similar measurements on mode 2, 

3 and 6 and found the coupling with mode 1 to be much weaker (see figure S8).   

We also observe strong nonlinear coupling between mode 4 and mode 5 resulting 

into  1:1  type  of  internal  resonance.  In  nonlinear  Duffing  systems  with  cubic 

nonlinearities  and  modes  with  frequencies  close  to  each  other,  it  is  possible  to 

observe 1:1 internal resonances31. Figure 5a shows the response of mode 5 as the 

drive force is progressively increased. The initially linear Lorentzian response slowly 

transforms  into  resonance  curve  with  two  peaks.  This  splitting  of  the  curve  is  a 

classic example of nonlinear mode coupling resulting into 1:1 internal resonance31.  

It is quite possible that the three internal resonances (and possibly more) in turn are 

coupled  to  other  vibrational  modes  leading  to  complex  transfer  of energy  between 

them.  Detailed 

information  about 

the  various  mode  shapes, 

their  coupling 

mechanisms and the ability to experimentally measure thermomechanical noise are 

essential to explicitly observe and understand the complex nature of the transfer of 

energy during the internal resonances. 

Conclusion: 

In conclusion, we demonstrate all electrical actuation and detection of atomically thin 

MoS2  nanoelectromechanical  resonator.  Unlike  previous  reports  with  electrical 

measurements of such resonators, we are able to identify more than 10 mechanical 

modes.  This  is  especially  useful  in  resonators  with  length  smaller  than  a  few 

micrometers which are difficult to transduce using optical method. Due to the large 

strain observed in these devices, there is strong nonlinear coupling between various 

vibrational modes of the devices. We exploit this strong coupling to demonstrate, for 

the first time in atomically thin resonator, two different types of internal resonances.

This ability to strongly couple different modes has implications for applications such 

as high stability oscillator32 and sensors in very high and ultra high frequency range. 

The  strong  coupling  and  the  ability  to  manipulate  the  coupling  by  changing  strain 

also makes these devices attractive tool to study nonlinear dynamics and quantum 

mechanics.

Figure 3: Nonlinear response of the device: a) Typical forward sweep frequency response of 
the device at moderate drives shows the nonlinear behavior. b) Response of device during 
the two internal resonances. Pinning of the peak frequency at 42.032MHz and 43.12MHz for 
a wide range of drive levels is observed.  c) Response of the first mode during forward (red) 
and  backward  (black)  frequency  sweep.  The  peak  frequency  43.12MHz  in  forward  sweep 
corresponds  to  second  internal  resonance  and  a  dip  in  backward  sweep  at  42.032MHz 
corresponds to the first internal resonance. d) Each internal resonance is characterized by 
pinning of the peak frequency and minimal change in peak amplitude for a large range of AC 
DC=15V  and 
drive  forces.    The  measurements  were  performed  using  2ω  method  with  Vg

Nonlinear mode coupling and internal resonances in MoS2

Device Fabrication: 

Bulk MoS2 was exfoliated on 285nm thick SiO2 on a highly p-doped Si substrate using 
standard scotch-tape technique. MoS2 flakes were identified under optical microscope. 
Contact  pads  were  patterned  by  electron  beam  lithography  followed  by  thermal 
evaporation to deposit Cr/Au (5nm/70nm). A second layer of lithography  was done to 
open a small window for selective etching of SiO2 under the MoS2 flake. Buffered Oxide 
Etchant  (BOE)  was  used  to  etch  out  approximately  150  nm  of  SiO2  under  the  flake. 
Subsequently critical point drying (CPD) was carried out to ensure that the suspended 
flake does not collapse due to surface tension. The device is slightly asymmetric with 
length of about 1.6µm and approximate width of 1.3µm. 

Electrical characterization: 

We perform electrical characterization of the suspended MoS2 device using two Keithley 
source meters. A dc voltage Vds is applied to the source contact pad keeping the drain 
contact  pad  grounded  while  another  dc  voltage  Vg
  is  applied  to  highly  doped  Si 
substrate as global back gate voltage. Figure S1a shows the output characteristic (Ids-
Vds) at different gate voltages and Figure S1b shows transfer characteristic (Ids-Vg) of 
the  device.  All  the  electrical  measurements  are  carried  out  at  room  temperature  and 
less  than  10-7  Torr  vacuum.  Forward  &  backward  sweep  data  are  taken  for  all  the 
measurements  and  there  is  no  sign  of  hysteresis.  The  symmetric  nature  of  Ids-Vds 

DC

indicates  that  the  contacts  are  ohmic  in  our  operating  range  of  the  Vds (-1V  to  +1V).

In this work, we rely on three different transduction mechanisms viz 1) 1ω mixed down 
technique2,3,  2)  2ω  mixed  down  technique3,4  and  3)  Frequency  Modulation(FM) 
technique5. As shown in table 1 in the main text, the three transduction schemes are 
reliably  able 
to  detect  most 
mechanical  resonances  below 
100MHz,  although  with  different

deep into nonlinear regime.

Figure S6: The amplitude response of the device

(Vg
see  a  hysteric  response  in  forward  and  reverse 
frequency  sweeps.    In  these  measurements  we 
bias the device with Vs

AC=71mV and Vg

DC=15V. 

 

Based  on  the  optical  contrast, 
our device is either bilayer or tri-
layer.  The  intrinsic  strain  in  the 
device  is  determined  by  fitting 
the  resonant  frequency  change 
with DC gate voltage (see figure 
S5).  Assuming  it  to  be  a  bilayer 
we  estimate  the  strain  to  be 
about 0.9% with mass loading of 
about 30. The strain is estimated 
to  be  about  0.7%  with  mass 

4 

loading of about 20 if the device is assumed to be tri-layer.  

 

 

Critical amplitude calculation: 

The displacement of the resonator in the linear regime is calculated using the procedure 
described  elsewhere2. We  estimate  the  critical  amplitude  of  the device  to be  close  to 
7nm. This relatively large critical amplitude could be the result of large strain as well as 
the interplay of both the cubic and quadratic nonlinearities in the system6. 

 

Internal resonance using 1ω method: 

Response of the fundamental mode in the strongly nonlinear regime can also be studied 
using  the  1ω  method.  Figure  S7  shows  the  response  of  the  device  in  the  nonlinear 
regime.  The  pinning  of  the  frequency  at  42.032MHz  can  be  clearly  seen.  We  also 
observe a small dip at 42.032MHz in the forward and backward frequency sweep when 
the drive levels are larger. This dip is typically larger during the backward sweep. In this 
AC) during the first 
method we observe increase in peak amplitude with ac drive level (Vg
internal  resonance.  We  believe  the  change  in  amplitude  observed  during  internal 
resonance  (figure  S7c)  is  primarily  due  to  the  change  in  electrical  background.  The 
electrical background is larger in 1ω method compared to the 2ω method.

higher  modes,  we  look  at  change  in  resonance  frequency  of  the  higher  mode  while
