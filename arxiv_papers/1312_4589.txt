Donors in silicon, conceptually described as hy-
drogen atom analogues in a semiconductor envi-
ronment, have become a key ingredient of many
"More-than-Moore" proposals such as quantum
information processing [1 -- 5] and single-dopant
electronics [6, 7]. The level of maturity this
field has reached has enabled the fabrication and
demonstration of transistors that base their func-
tionality on a single impurity atom [8, 9] allowing
the predicted single-donor energy spectrum to be
checked by an electrical transport measurement.
Generalizing the concept, a donor pair may be-
have as a hydrogen molecule analogue. However,
the molecular quantum mechanical solution only
takes us so far and a detailed understanding of the
electronic structure of these molecular systems
is a challenge to be overcome. Here we present
a combined experimental-theoretical demonstra-
tion of the energy spectrum of a strongly inter-
acting donor pair in the channel of a silicon nan-
otransistor and show the first observation of mea-
surable two-donor exchange coupling. Moreover,
the analysis of the three charge states of the pair
shows evidence of a simultaneous enhancement of
the binding and charging energies with respect to
the single donor spectrum. The measured data
are accurately matched by results obtained in
an effective mass theory incorporating the Bloch
states multiplicity in Si, a central cell corrected
donor potential and a full configuration interac-
tion treatment of the 2-electron spectrum. Our
data describe the basic 2-qubit entanglement ele-
ment in Kane's quantum processing proposal [1],
namely exchange coupling, implemented here in
the range of molecular hybridization.

A single dopant in silicon has the ability to dramat-
ically alter the electrical properties of state-of-the-art
CMOS transistors [10 -- 12] opening up a window for fun-
damental innovation. Single dopants have been detected
via resonant transport in the sub-threshold regime of
nanoFETs [13 -- 15] and recently a single-atom transistor
has been fabricated deterministically [9]. Experimental
studies have been backed up by theoretical calculations
that explained deviations from the donor bulk energy
spectrum. Capacitive coupling to the gate electrodes
[13], electric-field-induced Stark shift [16] and dielectric
confinement [17] modify the one and two-electron bind-
ing energies and reduce the charging energy presenting a
challenge for future technologies in terms of reproducibil-
ity and elevated temperature operation.

Two-donor devices present an opportunity to harness
the potential of single donor technology. In that sense,
researchers have developed donor-based single-electron
pumps [18 -- 20] and studied fundamental properties of
donors such as valley-orbit splitting [21], Anderson-Mott
transition [22] and coherent coupling [23]. However, the
most appealing implementation is quantum computation
where, in the Kane model, a donor molecule forms the
basic unit of quantum information processing [1].

In this Letter we present transport spectroscopy
through an arsenic molecule in silicon and develop a
novel analogy between donor dimers and the hydrogen
molecule based on a central-cell-corrected effective-mass
approximation. The model accounts for the enhanced
binding and charging energies, the finite exchange cou-
pling and the robustness against electric-field detun-
ing. Previous attempts based on EMA studies failed
to capture the subtle effects of valley physics in sili-
con [24] and only the asymptotic behaviour at large inter-
donor distances was obtained through Heitler-London

method [25]. The size of the system hinders first prin-
ciples and tight binding studies due to computational
cost [26, 27]

We find that our measured spectrum is in excellent
agreement with the theoretical model for an As molecule
with inter-atomic distance R=2.3 ±0.5 nm, demonstrat-
ing the first experimental evidence of transport through
a donor molecule in silicon.

resonances associated to individual As atoms  --  charg-
ing energies EC between 23 and 37 meV, as previously
reported for gated donors [15, 17]  --  with an average
of 2 As atoms per transistor. The FET controlled by G1
was the only one presenting resonant lines with enhanced
charging and binding energies, signaling a strongly cou-
pled donor pair in the channel of the transistor.

Fig. 1(c) shows the rf-response as a function of the
gate voltage (VG1). Below threshold (VG1=470 mV), ob-
tained from a fit to the linear region of the FET, we
observe a set of single donor or unintentional quantum
dot lines, marked as a and b, located at 34 and 15 meV
with respect to the conduction edge (see Methods). No-
+ and
tably, we observe two other transitions, D2
0 at -660 mV and -140 mV respectively, which
D2
are the main focus of this paper.

We quantify these energies by measuring the charac-
teristic Coulomb diamonds (Figs. 1(d) and 1(e)). We
find a charging energy of EC=70±3 meV, read from
the VSD axis at the point where the edges of the dia-
monds meet as to avoid the use of gate-voltage-to-energy
conversion parameters that depend on electron occu-
pancy and bias conditions (see Methods). Moreover, the
first ionization energy EI=56±5 meV is obtained from
the point at which the D+
2 transition meets with
the edge of the conduction band, indicated by the dot-
ted white lines. The second ionization energy is there-
fore EII=126±6 meV. These values are markedly larger
than expected for an isolated arsenic donor in bulk sil-
icon: EC=51.71 meV, EI =2.05 meV (As0→As−), and
EII =53.76 meV (As+→As0) [17].

The naive comparison of the measured values to a
rescaled theory of H2 molecules also leads to disappoint-
ing results (see Methods). Overcoming these apparent
inconsistencies demands a realistic theory of donor pairs
in Si. Calculations are performed here within an im-
proved effective mass approach, which includes central
cell corrections with an empirical radius rc leading to the
correct A1 energies, the full valley structure of the Si con-
duction band, and electron-electron correlations through
a configuration interaction method. This approach ex-
tends previous results [1, 25] to much smaller distances
R between dopants with higher accuracy. The central
cell correction enhances the one and two electron binding
energies (Fig. 2(a)) and indirectly enhances the electron-
electron repulsion shown in Fig. 2(b), due to the tighter
confinement of the A1 states.

Comparison between theory and experiment leads to
the identification of the particular interdonor distance R
of the molecule. We first compare the ionization energies
because of the smooth behavior of these energies with R,
regardless of the molecular orientation. Both EI and EII
measurements, indicated in Fig. 2(a), are consistent with
an inter-donor distance of R = 2.3±0.5 nm. This result is
also in agreement with the charging energy profile shown
in Fig. 2(b) despite its oscillatory behaviour.

In this study we use a double-gated metal-oxide-
semiconductor field-effect transistor to map the energy
spectrum of a donor molecule in Si [28, 29], as seen in
Fig. 1(a). The nanoFETs G1 and G2 control the energy
band bending of the environment immediately under it.
Setting it below threshold generates a barrier and current
only flows through quantum tunneling (Fig. 1(b)). Fur-
thermore, G1(2) tunes the electrochemical levels of the
impurities, i.e, the energy required to add an extra elec-
tron to the system. Whenever one of these levels resides
within the energy window of the bias voltage (centered at
VSD), transport through the structure can occur and res-
onant tunneling current peaks appear. In order to reduce
the effect of 1/f noise on these devices we used radio-
frequency reflectometry [30]. This technique probes the
complex impedance of the device generating a DC out-
put voltage VIF which is proportional to the differential
conductance (see Methods).

energy (left) and the singlet-triplet splitting (right). The ex-
perimentally measured energies are shown (red circles) at the
estimated interdonor distance R = 2.3 ± 0.5 nm.

We may confirm the molecular nature of these states
and learn about the spin configuration and the singlet-
triplet splitting ∆ST from the spin filling sequence of the
one and two-electron energy states [Fig. 3(a)]. The ex-
change coupling J in the Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian
JS1 · S2  --  the main ingredient in CNOT operations for
Kane's qubits  --  is determined by the singlet-triplet split-
ting as J = ∆ST /2. Experimentally, ∆ST can be ac-
curately identified by monitoring the evolution of the
electrochemical potentials (µ1,2) as a function of mag-
netic field, in this case applied in the plane of the device
(Fig. 3(b)). The rate of change with field is given by [31],

∂µ1,2
∂B(cid:107)

= −gµB∆S1,2

(1)

where g is the g-factor ≈ 2 for donor-bound electrons in
Si, µB = 57.8 µeV/T the Bohr magneton and ∆S the
change in total spin of the molecule when an extra elec-
tron is added. Filling the molecule with a spin-down (up)
electron results in a −(+)gµB/2 slope of the chemical po-
tential with magnetic field. In Fig. 3(c) we measure the
evolution of µ1(2) as a function of magnetic field up to
10 T.

The ground state of the first electron is the lower Zee-
man branch, therefore the 0 to 1 electron transition shifts
down as a function of field. In Fig. 3(c), the data is com-
pared to a Zeeman shift µB, calibrated to voltage shift
using the lever arm α0→1 = 0.21 extracted from the slope
+ transition, confirming the
of the edges of the D2
loading of a spin-down electron.

Experimentally the two-electron ground state Fig. 3(c)
shifts in the opposite direction at low magnetic fields,
consistently with the loading of a spin-up electron and
a singlet two-electron ground state at low fields. Here,
we use α1→2 = 0.10 extracted from the slopes of the
0 transition. At BST =6.53 T the slope changes

to −gµB/2 indicating a change in spin configuration, a
transition from spin-singlet to spin-triplet two electron
ground state. From the magnetic field at which this hap-
pens, we extrapolate a zero field singlet-triplet splitting
∆ST of 0.76 meV.

The small singlet-triplet splitting ∆ST measured can
be explained from the particular molecule orientation
leading to destructive interference of the electronic wave-
functions as seen in Fig. 2(b) for the (cid:104)110(cid:105) and (cid:104)111(cid:105)
crystallographic directions. This is a vivid example of
the fragility of the singlet-triplet splitting to the partic-
ular positioning of donors, as predicted in Ref. [25].

Finally we investigate the role of external electric fields
since these are known to modify the single-donor spec-
trum [16]. Figure 4(a) shows the effect of a detuning
electric field E = (VR − VL)/R applied along the axis of
the molecule for the distance R = 2.3 nm. This is ac-
complished by shifting the on-site energies on the molec-
ular orbital theory by δL,R = −eVL,R. We disregard
here the proximity of interfaces [15, 17]. The separa-
tion between donors is too small for the electric field to
generate a significant detuning. Moreover, the ionization
energies are large due to the molecular hybridization, so
that the charge states are robust against these external
fields. This robustness explains why our theory for bulk
Si describes well the energy levels even under the complex
environment in our FET devices.

We also study the hypothetical donor-pair separation,
R = 10 nm. In this case, the existence of a classically
forbidden region between the two donor sites permits a
study of the charge occupation of each site separately.
The charge stability diagram, shown in Fig. 4(b), is con-
sistent with the data from Fig. 2 and equivalent to the
diagram in a double quantum dot [32]. The analogy with
quantum dots may be explored to implement charge and
spin qubits.

METHODS SUMMARY

Experiment. Devices were fabricated on a high-
resistive silicon wafer (ρ>7000 Ωcm) and low-dose-ion-
implanted with arsenic (D=1e11 cm−2, E=15 keV). The
sacrificial oxide was removed after implant and a 10 nm
SiO2 gate oxide was regrown at 850◦C. C-V measure-
ments of similar devices indicate an interface trap charge
density of 1.8×1010 cm−2. The calculated profile gives a
dopant density of 5×1016cm−3 at 10 nm from the inter-
face. Two sets of electrically independent e-beam-defined
aluminium gates form the structure with nominal channel
dimensions l=40 nm and w=120 nm. A positive voltage
on the top gate induces an electron accumulation layer
which constitutes the source and drain reservoirs of the
FET. Measurements were performed at the base temper-
ature of a dilution refrigerator with an electron tempera-
ture of 200 mK. Radio-frequency reflectometry was per-
formed at 360 MHz by embeding the sample in a rf-tank
circuit formed by a surface mount inductor (390 nH) and
the parasitic capacitance to ground (500 fF).

Theory. We adopt the multivalley effective mass the-
ory with the explicit inclusion of a Yukawa-type po-
tential with empirical cut-off radius accounting for the
central cell corrections. The effective mass is taken to
be isotropic and to reproduce the hydrogenic energy
obtained from the anisotropic Kohn-Luttinger model.
The envelope function is obtained separately for each
of the A1, T2 and E states variationally as 1s Slater-
type orbitals. All single-electron integrals are calcu-
lated analytically following Ref. [33]. Electron-electron
repulsion integrals are calculated within Pople's STO-
2G scheme [34]. The wavefunction and energy spectrum
of the two-electron problem is obtained through spin-
adapted configuration interaction (SACI), an exact the-
ory within the chosen basis set which permits the sep-
arate analysis of the singlet and triplet subspaces. The
two-electron wavefunction radii are obtained minimizing
separately the singlet and triplet lowest eigenvalues of
the SACI matrices.

FIG. 4: Electric Field Effects. (a) Impact of an electric
field on the spectrum of a donor pair at R = 2.3 nm (simi-
lar to our sample). Up to fields as high as the SiO2 dielectric
strength, the charging energies, first and second ionization en-
ergies and the singlet-triplet splitting remain essentially un-
changed. (b) For R = 10nm, the charge distribution is quite
sensitive to external fields, as implied by the charge diagram
obtained. The pairs is aligned along the (110) direction in
both calculations.

The control over the charge degree of freedom at the
(0, 1) ↔ (1, 0) transition, instrumental for charge qubit
proposals [2], could be implemented with modest electric
fields. We estimate the tunnel coupling to be t = 210 µeV
from the level anti-crossing around δL = δR = 60 meV.

Interestingly, it is possible to estimate the order of
magnitude of the singlet-triplet splitting using the Hub-
bard model in the limit of small tunneling and large
charging energy. This regime (Mott limit) leads to
∆ST ≈ t2/U = 0.8 µeV, estimating the same-site charg-
ing energy U = 52 meV from the bulk D− energy in As.
The actual value calculated within the full configuration
interaction method is ∆ST = 1.2µeV. We expect this
approximation to be valid only for R (cid:38) 8 nm where a
classically forbidden barrier between the sites exists.

Our measurements and theory offer a proof of concept
for quantum computation proposals relying on the ex-
change coupling between electron spins on donors. By
analogy with artificial molecules, e.g. GaAs and Si dou-
ble quantum dots, there is potential for a dopant molecule
to be operated as a singlet-triplet spin qubit overcom-
ing current difficulties with Kane's architecture exchange
gates. Such a system would have the dual advantages of
enabling spin manipulation via electric, rather than mag-
netic fields, and the long spin coherence times of dopants
in silicon. Moreover, the sample we measure here has an
electron-electron spin exchange coupling J much larger
than the hyperfine coupling A with the nuclei, akin to
real molecules. This raises the possibility of engineer-
ing longer and more complex chains as a playground for
quantum chemistry on a chip. The exchange coupling
becomes comparable to the As bulk hyperfine coupling

METHODS

Device fabrication. The device fabrication starts by
growth of a 10 nm sacrificial oxide on a high-resistivity
(ρ>7000 Ωcm) (100) silicon wafer. Ohmic contacts were
defined by optical lithography and ion implantation of
phosphorus (15 keV, 1015 cm−2) and dopants included
by low-dose (15 keV, 1011 cm−2) ion-implantation of ar-
senic. The sacrificial silicon oxide was removed after the
implant and a 10 nm SiO2 gate oxide was regrown at
850◦C, which also anneals out the implantation damage.
A forming gas anneal at 450◦C for 30 min was performed
followed by a rapid thermal anneal for 15 s at 1050◦C to
reduce the interface trap and fixed oxide charge density.
The As profile was calculated by an implantation Monte-
Carlo simulator [35] and has a maximum at 10 nm from
the interface and a peak density of 5×1016cm−3 result-
ing in a statistical mean inter-dopant distance of 27 nm.
However, the expected segregation of As towards the in-
terface during the subsequent thermal processing leads
to an increase in the donor density at the interface and
favours clustering [36]. By comparison, the residual phos-
phorus doping is estimated to be smaller than 1012 cm−2.
Subsequent to the silicon processing, surface gates were
fabricated by electron beam lithography and thermal
evaporation of aluminium. Fig.1(a,b) shows a scanning
electron microscopy image of an identical device and its
schematic cross-section. As a first step, two gates 40 nm
wide and 100 nm apart were defined by evaporation of a
25 nm thick layer of aluminium. They are used to form
the tunable source and drain tunnel barriers. After ther-
mal oxidation at 150◦C for 5 min creating a 5 nm AlOx
layer, a second electrically-independent 60 nm thick top
gate was deposited over the barriers. This top-gate de-
fines the 120 nm wide channel of the SET and leads that

5

overlap with the doped ohmic contacts. From the litho-
graphical dimensions of the two sets of gates it is possible
to estimate an average number of 2 As atoms per tun-
nel barrier. Prior to measurement the samples undergo
a nitrogen ambient post-fabrication anneal at 350◦C for
15 min. The interface trap density, measured on simulta-
neously processed field effect transistors, without e-beam
radiation, by means of low frequency split C-V method
[37], is 1.8×1010cm−2.

Measurement techniques.

Electrical transport
measurements were performed at the base temperature of
a dilution refrigerator (electron temperature of 200 mK)
using radio-frequency reflectometry [30]. This technique
probes the reflection coefficient of a resonant circuit that
includes the device as a circuit element (Fig. 5(a)). As
the impedance, in this case the differential conductance,
of the device changes so does the reflection coefficient of
the resonant circuit (Fig. 5(b)). This technique allows an
increase of bandwidth over a standard DC or lock-in mea-
surement. The sample was embedded in a rf-tank circuit
formed by a surface mount 390 nH inductor and a para-
sitic capacitance (500 fF) to ground. An rf-carrier signal
was applied to the source of the device at the resonant
frequency of 360 MHz and the cryo-amplified reflected
signal is homodyne detected [29]. A bias tee on the sam-
ple board permitted the simultaneous measurement of
the two terminal DC conductance. The measurements
presented here have been obtained after a bias cool down,
VG1=VG2=VT G=1 V. When performing transport spec-
troscopy of the SB device the TG and DB was set well-
above threshold (VT G=VG2=2 V). The devices survived
several thermal cycles preserving the subthreshold tran-
sitions independently of the bias during the cool-down,
confirming its atomic origin.

The source of the sample is connected to a resonant tank
circuit form by surface mount inductor (390 nH) and the par-
asitic capacitance to ground (500 fF). +40 dB amplification at
1.5 K is achieved by a cryogenic amplifier. (b) Comparison be-
tween the reflectometry response ∆VIF and the source-drain

Experimental considerations. Due to the electro-

RFINRFOUT360 MHzHomodyneDetection+40dB390 nHDUT500 fFVIFa)b)G(ìS)static configuration of our device in Fig. 1(b), transport
spectroscopy senses only impurities close to the interface
immediately below the barrier electrode. The electro-
static properties of single dopants are modified by the
presence of an electric field [16]: For gated donors a re-
duction in EC due to screening effects has been exper-
imentally observed [8], while there is experimental ev-
idence of an enhanced EC in systems under quantum
confinement [38], which is very unlikely to occur for the
planar geometry of our device. The possible effect of
the dielectric mismatch cannot explain quantitatively in
any case the observed energy enhancement [17] ruling
out any of the aforementioned mechanism as the origin
of the simultaneous increase of the binding and charging
energies.

In order to obtain highly accurate values of the bind-
ing and charging energies we consider the point in VSD at
which the edges of the Coulomb diamonds meet. Conven-
tionally a constant voltage-to-energy calibration param-
eter α = ED/VG1, where ED is the energy at the dopant
site, is used to obtain energy values from gate voltage
changes [12]. However, under the considerations of the
constant interaction model, this is expected to be differ-
ent for different electronic occupations of the molecule as
experimentally observed here. Moreover, α could vary
with bias conditions [13] reducing the accuracy of this
method.

The states a, b in Fig. 1(c) have been described else-
where as single dopant states or unintentional quantum
dots generated due to potential irregularities at the in-
terface [28].

Theory. The theory of H2 molecules in vacuum could
be rescaled by the effective semiconductor energy and
distance atomic scales, but the results are misleading.
In order to get values comparable to the measured ones
we have to reach the hypothetical limit of R → 0 where
the two atoms merge into a He-like atom with EC = 68
meV, EI = 56 meV, and EII = 125 meV. The equivalent
of a He atom in Si would be a group VI donor  --  S, Se,
or Te  --  but the accidental presence of these is highly un-
likely and the binding energies for these dopants are much
larger [39] than the ones measured here (e.g. for S, these
values are respectively EC = 295 meV, EI = 318 meV
and EII = 613 meV). Moreover, the singlet-triplet split-
ting measured here is smaller than the rescaled splitting
between ortho and parahelium by two orders of magni-
tude.

We take the impurity potential Vimp to reflect the com-
plications associated with the departure from the hydro-
genic model. The deviation of Vimp from the point charge
screened coulomb potential has its roots on the finite
screening length, the structure of the electronic cloud of
valence electrons and the covalent bonds. All these ef-
fects modify the effective impurity potential at the scale
of the atomic radius, which is much smaller than the typ-
ical size of the wavefunction of shallow impurities in the

6

hydrogenic model a∗. Only the first effect can be taken
into account without getting into the details of the chem-
ical nature of the donor. The most common approach is
to consider an usual point charge potential modified by a
semi-empirical central cell correction. This way, we write
the full impurity potential Vimp(r) = VH (r) + VCC(r) as
the superposition of the uniformly screened point charge
hydrogenic potential

experimental valley splitting. A similar approach was
adopted by Wellard and Hollenberg [40], with their em-
pirical parameter η rescaling the dielectric function to fit
the experimental A1 energy.

These states are split if we take into account the the in-
tervalley coupling due to the crystal field potential, lead-
ing to a non-degenerate ground state (A1), a three-fold
degenerate first excited state (T) and a doubly degener-
ate second excitation(E). Nevertheless, the mere inclu-
sion of the intervalley integrals of the Coulomb potential
severely underestimates the separation between the exci-
tation energies [40].

The most prominent source of splittings comes from
the central cell correction discussed above, which acts
differently on the six states. While A1 is even under re-
flections on the cartesian planes around the donor site, T
and E are odd, so that in the region where the central cell
correction is most active (r < rcc), ΨA1 has a peak while
all the ΨTi and ΨEi have a node, and therefore nearly
vanish. Indeed, the experimental binding energies of the
T and E states are reasonably described by the hydro-
genic model, while the A1 binding energy is considerably
larger.

The Kohn-Luttinger model treats this splitting empir-
ically, while no correction to the wavefunction localiza-
tion is made. Kohn [41] pointed out that the asymptotic

behavior of the wavefunction is expected to be signifi-
cantly altered by the central cell correction, leading to
A1 states more localized than the excited states. Fol-
lowing this argument, we ascribe different wavefunction
variational decay radii aA1 = aCC = 1.20 nm for the cen-
tral cell corrected A1 state (obtained variationally from
the hamiltonian with the full impurity potential Vimp )
and aT i = aEi = asv = 2.14 nm for all the T and E states
(which results directly from solving the hydrogenic prob-
lem and disregarding VCC). The variational energy ob-
tained is exactly the experimental energy by construction
(by fitting rCC).
The two donors, referred to as A and B, located at
positions rA and rB are separated by a vector R = rB −
rA. The crystal defines cartesian directions, so that the
energy and wavefunction of an electron at a position r
depends on the full vector and not only on the distances
to the point charges rA = r − rA and rB = r − rB
 --  differently from the analogue H+
2 problem. This is
not clear from the effective mass hamiltonian of a double
donor, which reads

HDD(r) = −2∇2

2m∗ + Vimp(rA) + Vimp(rB).

(4)

The matrix elements of this hamiltonian are calculated
in the molecular orbital approximation, i.e., in the basis
set defined by the six valley combinations Ψµ centered at
rA and rB, so that the hamiltonian is a 12×12 matrix
composed of four blocks

H =

(cid:21)

(cid:20) HAA HAB
(cid:90)

HBA HBB

Blocks HAA and HBB are diagonal and represent the
on-site energies, while the tunnel coupling is determined
by the blocks HAB and HBA. The hamiltonian above
is symmetric under the exchange of A ↔ B. Later we
will study the system in which this symmetry is broken
introducing a detuning potential.

A1 states) and Esv (for E and T states), corrected
by a long range classical term which reads V (cid:48)
imp =
(cid:104)ΨA1 (rA)(VH (rB)+VCC(rB)ΨA1 (rA)(cid:105) for A1 states and
H = (cid:104)ΨA1 (rA)VH (rB)ΨA1 (rA)(cid:105) for E and T states. It
V (cid:48)
is interesting to notice that, due to the periodicity of
the Bloch functions, the same argument regarding the
different effect of the central cell on A1 and T/E states
apply here. In other words, the ΨA1 (rA) state presents a
peak at the B site and is influenced by the central cell of
the B impurity VCC(rB), while the ΨTi(rA) and ΨEi(rA)
states present a node and are immune to the central cell
correction.

The off diagonal terms in HAA and HBB are only
approximatly vanishing, since with the presence of the
second donor the problem looses its spherical symmetry.
But direct calculation reveal this to be a good approxi-
mation.

The off-diagonal blocks are related by the hermiticity
†
BA. Each term is a summation over

condition HAB = H
integrals of the type

ν (cid:105) =

F (rA, ai)e−ikµ·(r−RA)u∗

µ(r − RA)HDD(r)F (rB, aj)eikν·(r−RB)uν(r − RB)d3r.

(6)

These matrix elements can be straightforwardly calcu-
lated using the plane wave expansion of the Bloch func-
tions (see Ref. 42), and no further approximation is neces-
sary. Nevertheless, it is useful to express these integrals
in a simpler form adopting some very robust and well
tested approximations: (i) taking the matrix elements
for µ (cid:54)= ν to be vanishing, since these consist of rapidly
µuµ ≈ 1, as suggested
oscillatory integrands; (ii) taking u∗
in Ref. 42. With these, we write

(cid:105) = δµ,νeikµ·Rtsv(R, ai, aj),

where tsv is the single valley tunnel coupling

tsv(R, ai, aj) =

(8)

The effect of the hopping blocks HAB is analogous to

the H2 molecule  --  at distances much larger than ai and
aj, this block is null and the states centered around sites
A and B are degenerate, while for distances comparable
to the wavefunction radius there is the formation of sym-
metric and antisymmetric superpositions of the localized
orbital with splitted energies. Unlike the H2 analogue,
it is possible for the antisymmetric state (referred to as
antibonding in the context of H2 in vacuum) to be the
ground state here, since the hoppings are not necessar-
ily real negative numbers due to the oscillatory phase
exp(ikµ · R).

The same oscillatory phase may also lift the degenera-
cies of the T and E states. For instance, if the pair align-
ment is along the x direction, the states Ty and Tz are
still equivalent, while the state Tx will have a symetric-
antisymmetric splitting that oscillates as a function of

R.

It is known from the H2 problem that the molecular
orbital approximation gives accurate results only if the
variational wavefunction radius is taken to minimize the
expectation value of the complete hamiltonian contain-
ing the two protons. We do the same here, minimizing
numerically the lowest eigenvalue of the double donor
hamiltonian HDD with relation to all the six wavefunc-
tion radii ai.

Given the solution of the problem of one electron with
two donors discussed above, we may use these 12 molecu-
lar orbitals to write down spin-orbitals from Slater deter-
minants. Combining suitably the Slater determinants, we
may identify 78 spin singlets and 66 triplets (for a total of
12 × 12 = 144 two-electron spin-orbitals). These include
all possible excitations of the two electrons. Calculating
the matrix elements of the full hamiltonian, including the
electron-electron repulsion, we may obtain the full con-
figuration interaction ground state. Since we explicitly
disconnect the singlet and triplet blocks, this method is
often referred to as Spin Adapted Configuration Interac-
tion, or SACI.

The explicit calculation of the two-electron exchange
and hybrid integrals is an outstanding problem in com-
putational quantum chemistry, and is often solved ap-
proximately. One of the most successful approaches is to
fit a number N of gaussian orbitals to the Slater-type or-
bital obtained in the single electron problem. This basis
set, called STO-N G, converges quickly [34]. We tested
N = 2 and N = 3 without significant improvement. All
data presented is for N = 3, though.

Our method is therefore well tested and robust in all
regimes except at distances R comparable to the central
cell region. At this region, the polarization cloud around
the donor nuclei is non-trivial and the effective poten-
tial acting on conduction electrons is most likely non-
additive. Therefore, this theory is not capable of describ-
ing vicinal donors (substituting first nearest neighbor Si
sites). We set a minimum distance of R > 1a0 = 0.543
nm as a conservative boundary for our theory.
