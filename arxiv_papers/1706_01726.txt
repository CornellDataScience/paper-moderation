Abstract

We report on the effect of the lateral confinement and a perpendicular magnetic field on isolated

room-temperature magnetic skyrmions in sputtered Pt/Co/MgO nanotracks and nanodots. We

show that the skyrmions size can be easily tuned by playing on the lateral dimensions of the

nanostructures and by using external magnetic field amplitudes of a few mT, which allow to reach

sub-100 nm diameters. Our XMCD-PEEM observations also highlight the important role of the

pinning on the skyrmions size and stability under an out-of-plane magnetic field. Micromagnetic

simulations reveal that the effect of local pinning can be well accounted for by considering the

thin film grain structure with local anisotropy variations and reproduce well the dependence of the

skyrmion diameter on the magnetic field and the geometry.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale whirling spin configurations [1]. Their small size,

topological protection and the fact that they can be manipulated by small in-plane current

densities have opened a new paradigm to manipulate the magnetization at the nanoscale.

This has led to proposals for novel memory and logic devices in which the magnetic skyrmions

are the information carriers [2]. They were first observed in B20 chiral magnets thin films [3,

4] within confined geometries [5, 6], and in ultrathin epitaxial films [7–9] at low temperature.

The recent observation of room-temperature magnetic skyrmions [10–19] and their current-

induced manipulation [11, 12, 16, 19–22] in sputtered magnetic films have lifted an important

bottleneck toward the practical realization of such devices. However, these experiments have

also underlined the sensitivity of the skyrmions dynamics to the defects in the materials as

well as the edges which can impede reliable motion. This raises the question of stability -

nucleation and annihilation - in these sputtered ultrathin magnetic films. More recently, the

influence of the granular structure and the inherent disorder of these films on the skyrmions

stability have begun to be addressed [16, 19, 23].

Here we report on the observation of the effect of the lateral confinement, a perpendicular

magnetic field and the local pinning sites on the magnetic texture in sputtered Pt/Co/MgO

ultrathin nanostructures with isolated room-temperature magnetic skyrmions. In particular,

the evolution of the mean skyrmion diameter in sub-micrometers nanotracks and nanodots

is followed by high resolution magnetic imaging. These experimental results are supported

by micromagnetic simulations which reproduce well the magnetic field dependence of the

skyrmion size in the different geometries. Notably, we show that the granular structure of

the sputtered materials leads to local pinning of the skyrmion which can strongly affect its

shape and size. Our results underline that the local pinning and the sample's geometry play

an important role in the field dependence of the skyrmion size and its stability in ultrathin

films.

II. METHODS

We used X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism combined with Photo-Emission Electron

Microscopy (XMCD-PEEM) at room-temperature to obtain a direct image of the magne-

2

tization pattern with a high lateral spatial resolution (down to ∼ 30 nm). The observed

contrast is proportional to the projection of the magnetization on the incident X-ray beam

direction, which is impinging on the sample under a grazing angle of 16°. As a result, the

magnetic contrast is about 3.5 times larger for the magnetization in the sample plane as

compared to the magnetization perpendicular to it. As shown in our previous work [13],

this allows the direct observation of the internal spin structure of magnetic domain walls

(DWs) or magnetic skyrmions. The XMCD-PEEM experiments were carried out with the

SPELEEM III microscope (Elmitec GmbH) at the Nanospectroscopy beamline at the Elettra

synchrotron in Basovizza, Trieste, Italy, at the CIRCE beamline at the Alba synchrotron,

Barcelona, Spain [24, 25] and at the IO6 beamline at the Diamond synchrotron, Didcot,

UK.

The Ta(3)/Pt(3)/Co(0.5-1.1)/MgOx/Ta(2) (thickness in nm) film was deposited by mag-

netron sputtering on a 100 mm high-resistivity Si wafer, then annealed for 1.5 h at 250°C

under vacuum and an in-plane magnetic field of 240 mT. The Co layer was deposited as

a wedge. The magnetic domains in the thin film are perpendicularly magnetized. All the

images presented correspond to a nominal Co thickness of about 1.0 nm, an area close to

the reorientation transition and were obtained at room temperature.

The micromagnetic simulations were performed using the Mumax3 code [26]. We used

the following micromagnetic parameters extracted from our previous experiments [13] : the

Co layer thickness t = 1.06 nm, the exchange constant A = 2.75×10−11 J.m−1, the uniaxial

anisotropy constant Ku = 1.45×106 J.m−3, the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction

constant D = 2.05×10−3 J.m−2, and the saturation magnetization Ms = 1.44×106 A.m−1.

For all the geometries considered hereafter, the cells size is 1 nm × 1 nm × 1.06 nm with only

one cell across the film thickness, so that the magnetization is supposed to be uniform along

this direction. For convenience, all the simulations were performed at T = 0 K, although

temperature should play a significant role on the skyrmion stabilization and interaction with

the local disorder [27]. Finally, we define ds as the mean skyrmion diameter, namely the

diameter that would have a perfectly circular bubble with the same area as the distorted

one.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Observation of room-temperature magnetic skyrmions in nanotracks

At remanence or in the presence of a small magnetic field (< 2 mT), worm-like domains

are observed in the tracks (Fig.1.a), a configuration which minimizes the dipolar energy.

These worms tend to align with the tracks, while they are randomly oriented in the largest

areas of the nanostructures. Moreover, they seem to be repelled from the edges, which is

reproduced well by the simulations. Interestingly, a strong white (black) contrast is observed

on the upper (bottom) DWs delimiting the worm-like domains (see inset of Fig.1.a). As the

contrast is proportional to the projection of the magnetization along the X-ray propagation

direction, and the DWs are perpendicular to this direction, the contrast is consistent with

DWs having a left-handed homochiral N´eel structure [13]. This internal DW structure is

reproduced well by the micromagnetic simulations. When applying a larger magnetic field

(typically Bz > 2 mT) the initial worm-like domains shrink and lead to the formation of iso-

lated skyrmions (Fig.1.b-c). Again, the white/black contrast at the top/bottom edge of the

skyrmion demonstrates that the homochiral N´eel structure is conserved (see inset of Fig.1.b).

The average skyrmion diameter is plotted as a function of Bz in Fig.2 for tracks of two

different widths (300 nm and 500 nm) along with the results of the simulations. For both

wire widths, a large decrease of the skyrmions size is observed when small fields (∼ 5 mT)

are applied. In the 300 nm tracks, the average diameter changes from 140 nm down to 80

nm, showing a large susceptibility of the skyrmions size to Bz. In addition, we observe that

the track width affects the skyrmions size in particular at low magnetic field : the narrower

the track the smaller the skyrmions, as suggested by previous numerical studies [28]. This

geometrical confinement effect can be explained by the dipolar interactions of the DWs

delimiting the skyrmion with the magnetic charges on the tracks edges. These results thus

show that the skyrmion size can be easily tuned by playing both on the lateral confinement

and the magnetic field [29]. As the magnetic field increases and the skyrmion diameter

decreases, the influence of the track width on the skyrmion becomes smaller, indicating

that the skyrmion equilibrium size is governed by the Zeeman energy term and that the

dipolar interaction with the track edges plays a less important role. However, we also see

4

experimentally that, for Bz = 6.7 mT, some of the skyrmions are not visible anymore and

even more have disappeared at Bz = 8.5 mT. In fact they are too small to be observed,

since by decreasing the magnetic field down to ∼ 1 mT (not shown), the skyrmions expand

and turn into worm-like domains at the same position as they were initially. Interestingly,

we observed in 540 nm-wide tracks, that magnetic skyrmions can be stabilized also at zero

external magnetic field (see Fig.1.d) ; this can be attributed to the presence of local pinning

sites.

In the following section, we present the results of the observation of magnetic skyrmions

in a Pt/Co/MgO circular nanodot and we discuss the role played by the local disorder on

the field dependence of the skyrmion size.

B. Magnetic skyrmion in a circular nanodot

The images presented in Fig.3.a. show a magnetic skyrmion in a 630 nm-diameter circu-

lar dot at zero external magnetic field with a diameter of about 190 nm. We first observe

that the skyrmion is positionned near the edge of the dot, whereas the dipolar repulsion

from the edges favor a skyrmion position in the center of the dot. This suggests that the

skyrmion is pinned by local defects near the edge of the dot. The application of a small

perpendicular magnetic field does not change substantially the skyrmion structure and its

size (Fig.3.b, Bz = 1.5 mT) up to a critical field Bz = 2.8 mT where a sudden decrease of

the skyrmion diameter to 90 nm is observed (see Fig.3.c-d and stars in Fig.3.e). Moreover,

the skyrmion appears slightly distorted for Bz < 2.4 mT while it is circularly shaped for

Bz > 2.4 mT.

To better understand these experimental results, we performed micromagnetic simula-

tions in the case of a perfect disorder-free film. The initial state is a 200 nm-diameter circular

bubble placed at the center of the 630 nm-diameter circular dot ; this configuration is then

relaxed to the minimum energy state at zero field. When the magnetic field increases, the

skyrmion diameter decreases continuously and covers a wider range of sizes than the one

observed (see Fig.3.e, red dots). Moreover, the contraction of the core is isotropic and the

skyrmion stays in the center of the dot (not shown), as expected notably from the symmetry

5

of the demagnetizing field.

Is it well known that the polycrystalline grain structure of magnetic ultrathin films is

a source of local pinning for magnetic DWs [30–32]. To model it, we introduce a grain

distribution with a fixed average grain size g. From grain to grain, we assume that the

uniaxial anisotropy constant fluctuates randomly following a Gaussian distribution with

a mean value Ku,0 (the measured macroscopic value) and a standard deviation δKuKu,0,

where δKu quantifies the pinning strength [23, 32, 33]. The grain size and the anisotropy

were varied respectively within the ranges 10 nm ≤ g ≤ 100 nm and 2.5 % ≤ δKu ≤ 10 %

with multiple realizations for each set of parameters. Our simulations reveal a very similar

behavior to the experimental one for several realizations of grains distributions (i.e. for given

sets of parameters {g, δKu}). We show in Fig.3.e. (green squares) the dependence of the

skyrmion diameter on the perpendicular magnetic field for a specific realization, shown in

Fig.3.f-h, with g = 70 nm and δKu = 2.5 %. As it is observed experimentally, the skyrmion

diameter decreases in a step-like fashion when the magnetic field reaches a certain critical

value. On the images presented in Fig.3.f-h, the center of the DW delimiting the skyrmion

is represented on the grain structure at zero field, before (Bz = 2.25 mT) and after the jump

(Bz= 2.5 mT) respectively ; with mz < 0 inside the white border and mz > 0 outside. The

color scale indicates the amplitude of the anisotropy constant in each grain. The case of

relatively large grains (g = 70 nm) has been chosen for clarity but other grain configurations

allow to reproduce this step-like behavior. For Bz ≤ 2.25 mT, the equilibrium position and

shape of the skyrmion is determined by the grains of weakest anisotropy (darkest regions)

so that, in order to lower the DW energy, the skyrmion core is stretched away from its

initial circular shape and its initial position in the center of the dot. In this field range, the

skyrmion is trapped in its initial position by the local grain structure and the magnetic field

affects little its shape and position. When the depinning field (Bz = 2.5 mT) is reached, the

skyrmion prefers to jump in a neighboring region where the anisotropy is smaller leading

to smaller DW energy despite the additional cost in dipolar energy away for the dot center.

Thus, the polycrystalline grain structure of the sputtered material allows to reproduce the

experimentally observed step-like behavior when applying an external magnetic field, as well

as the local pinning near the edge.

6

C. Statistical study : influence of the grain size g and the pinning strength δKu

In the previous section, we discussed one particular example and showed that one can

find configurations which reproduce well the behavior of the skyrmion in a nanodot under

an out-of-plane magnetic field. Here we investigate the influence of the characteristic pa-

rameters of the disorder : the grain size g and the pinning strength δKu. For each set of

parameters {g, δKu}, the diameter is averaged over multiple realizations and < ds > will

refer to the skyrmion diameter averaged over 50 different realizations (g and δKu being fixed).

In Fig.4.a, < ds > is plotted as a function of the applied magnetic field for grain sizes

between 10 nm and 100 nm and for δKu = 2.5%. For comparison, the case of an ideal,

disorder-free film (red dots) and the experimental measurements (black stars) are also

represented.

It appears that, on average, the skyrmion size and its field dependence are

little affected by the grain size, except for the smallest one considered (g = 10 nm) where

skyrmions are less sensitive to the pinning at high field. In fact, this behavior is observed

for larger values of δKu (up to 10 % in this study), meaning that the skyrmion is more

sensitive to the applied field for g = 10 nm than for all the other grain sizes considered here.

However, for g ranging between 20 nm and 100 nm, there is no monotonic variation of the

diameter with the grain size. We note that this seems in contrast with previous numerical

reports [23, 32] where a maximum in the DW depinning field was observed when the mean

grain size equals the DW width π∆. We do not observe such a maximum in our simulations

when g = π∆ = 40 nm.

To complete the picture, the graph of Fig.4.b shows < ds > as a function of g at zero

applied field and for two different pinning strengths : δKu = 2.5 % and δKu = 10 %. We

observe that at low pinning strength, the skyrmion diameter is approximately constant with

the grain size, whereas it increases on average for larger pinning strength, but this is negli-

gible for g ≤ 50 nm. Note that this remains true at higher fields. In fact, at high pinning,

the initial state is stretched out after relaxation and this effect is all the more important

as the grain size increases and it very often turns skyrmions into worm-like domains. This

results in a small shift (along the y-axis) of the curves < ds(Bz) > for δKu = 10 % and

g ≥ 50 nm (not shown). However, it does not affect the field dependence, as it is discussed

7

hereafter. On the contrary, for relatively weak pinning strengths (δKu = 2.5 % and δKu =

5 %), the skyrmion recovers its initial circular symmetry at high field, as shown in Fig.3.h.

When starting from a large magnetic field and decreasing its amplitude, the quasi-circular

skyrmion very often expands into an irregularly-shaped domain, a behavior observed in

other systems and attributed to structural defects [34]. An additional interesting feature

is that the standard deviation (error bars) increases with the grain size for both pinning

strengths, suggesting that for a strong anisotropy disorder and for a large film surface, for

instance a one-dimensional track, one will be more likely to observe an important dispersion

in terms of sizes and shapes for large grains.

We now discuss the influence of the pinning strength on the magnetic field susceptibility

of the skyrmion size. We define η as the slope (absolute value) obtained from a linear fit

of the curves < ds(Bz) > within the field range 2 mT ≤ Bz ≤ 5 mT and at fixed g and

δKu, consistently with our experimental results (Fig.2). Since, for a given pinning strength,

no significant change in this slope with the mean grain size is observed (see Fig.4.a for the

case δKu = 2.5 %), we plot the average value < η >g of the slope η over the grain size g

as a function of δKu in Fig 4.c. We see that < η >g, which quantifies the sensitivity of

the skyrmion to the applied magnetic field, decreases rapidly for δKu between 2.5 % and

7.5 % and then seems to saturate. When the disorder is too important, in this case δKu ≥

7.5 %, the skyrmion shape and size is fully determined by the grains and the anisotropy

mapping and the small external magnetic field has little influence on the final state. This

is also confirmed by the small standard deviation observed for δKu = 10 % : whatever the

grain size, when the anisotropy disorder is strong, the effect of the magnetic field becomes

negligible. Actually, the probability for a step-like decrease of the diameter falls to zero

within this field range as soon as δKu ≥ 7.5 %. The field sensitivity of the skyrmion diameter

thus provides an indirect way to assess the disorder in the thin film and our experimental

value of η = 17 nm.mT−1 in the 500 nm-wide tracks indicates a disorder δKu typically lower

than 5 %.

8

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have observed that the skyrmion size in Pt/Co(1 nm)/MgO can be easily

tuned by reducing the dimensions of the nanostructures and that magnetic field amplitudes

of a few mT allow to reach sub-100 nm diameters. These observations also highlight the

important role of the pinning on the skyrmion size and stability under an out-of-plane

magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the effect of local pinning can be well

accounted for by considering the thin film grain structure with local anisotropy variations

and reproduce well the dependence of the skyrmion diameter on the magnetic field and the

geometry. Our simulation suggests a relatively small anisotropy disorder in our thin films

(typically, δKu ≤ 5 %). These results also reflect that the Pt/Co/MgO system, due to its

simple structure, can be efficiently modeled, which paves the way for further experimental

and micromagnetic investigations.

[29] A similar field dependence of the skyrmions size has been observed in larger structures, as

reported by S. Woo et al. in 2 µm-diameter Pt/Co/Ta disks (see [12], Supplementary Infor-

mation). Nevertheless, in our case, the skyrmions number and their size are limited by the

track width at small fields.
