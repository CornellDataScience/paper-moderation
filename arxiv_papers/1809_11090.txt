Single wall carbon nanotubes cooled to cryogenic temperatures are outstanding electronic as well as nano-
electromechanical model systems. To probe a largely unperturbed system, we measure a suspended carbon-
nanotube device where the nanotube is grown in the last fabrication step, thus avoiding damage and residues
from subsequent processing. In this ultra-clean device, we observe the transport spectrum and its interaction with
nano-electromechanics over a wide gate voltage range and thereby over a wide range of coupling parameters
between the quantum dot and the contact electrodes.

INTRODUCTION

Both the electronic and the nano-electromechanical low-
temperature properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes have
attracted significant research over the past decades, resulting
in a large spectrum of publications [1].
In particular "ultr-
aclean", as grown carbon nanotubes are prototypical single-
electron devices [2], where the unperturbed transport spec-
trum reveals a wide range of phenomena originating from the
band structure [3 -- 6] and the interaction between the charge
carriers [7 -- 10]. At the same time, single-wall carbon nan-
otubes at millikelvin temperatures are excellent mechanical
resonators [11 -- 13], with resonance frequencies up to 39GHz
[14] and quality factors up to 5× 106 [15]. In suspended car-
bon nanotube devices, the electrostatic forces acting on single
electrons dominate the mechanical behaviour, and electronic
transport is subject to strong coupling between single electron
tunneling and vibrational motion [16 -- 18].

Typically, reports focus on selected aspects of the behaviour
of carbon nanotubes, possibly across several devices. While
this is a suitable approach for in-depth analysis of the ob-
served phenomena, it is challenging to obtain a complete
picture of the behaviour of one single wall nanotube device
across all regimes of coupling to the leads. Here, we present
low-temperature measurement data collected on a single de-
vice. We follow both electronic and nano-electromechanical
phenomena from the highly transparent transport through hole
states, across the band gap to strong Coulomb blockade, and
finally towards larger electron numbers, where the tunnel bar-
riers become increasingly transparent with higher order trans-
port processes dominating the current.

The schematic device geometry is sketched in Fig. 1(a).
The device fabrication follows the approach of [2]. We start
with a highly p++ doped silicon wafer having a 500nm dry-
grown thermal surface oxide. The contact electrodes, with a
bilayer of 10nm tungsten and 40nm platinum, are fabricated
using electron beam lithography, metal evaporation, and lift-
off. Subsequently, the silicon oxide surface is anisotropically
etched by 100nm to deepen the trenches between the elec-
trodes. Nanotube growth catalyst is locally deposited via an
additional lithography step, drop-casting, and lift-off [19]. In
the final fabrication step, the carbon nanotubes are grown in
situ by chemical vapour deposition [19]. The distance be-

tween the contact electrodes is L = 1.2 µm, providing a lower
boundary for the length of the active nanotube segment.
A measurement of the low-bias (Vsd = 20 µV) current
through the device at base temperature T ≤ 25mK of the di-
lution refrigerator is plotted in Fig. 1(b). On the hole conduc-
tion side, i.e. for Vg < 0.3V, the device is highly transparent,
while the electron conduction side, Vg > 0.3V, initially dis-
plays strong Coulomb blockade. This indicates that the actual
contacts between nanotube and platinum electrodes are trans-
parent. The opaque tunnel barriers of the quantum dot at low
electron number are given by the extended p-n junctions be-
tween the electrostatically n-doped central nanotube segment
and the nanotube segments close to the leads [3, 20, 21].

Figure 1(c) shows a measurement of the transversal vibra-
tional resonance of the carbon nanotube [11, 12]. Here, the

tance emerges. The yellow asterisks in Fig. 2 mark character-

Figure 2(c) zooms in on the band gap edge; here we plot

scale since this allows us to resolve smaller signals. The fea-
ture at Vg = 0.22V turns out to be a clear double-peak, i.e.,
two nearly merged Coulomb oscillations, consistent with the
curve shape of Fig. 2(a) [see the dashed boxes in both figures].
Since the Kondo ridges are associated with odd electron or
hole numbers, this means that at Vg ≈ 0.23V the nanotube is
charged with an even number of holes. This leaves us with a
conundrum about the nature of the structure at Vg ≈ 0.24V,
also visible as a single sharp peak in Fig. 2(a) and marked in
both figures with an arrow. Two explanations are possible:
either this is a single Coulomb oscillation and an additional
oscillation cannot be resolved due to too small tunnel rates, or
this peak is already a merger of two oscillations. The former
explanation seems unlikely since, even at high bias, no further
structures in current or conductance are visible at the hole side
of the band gap region. Measurements at larger temperature
and at finite magnetic field may provide additional informa-
tion.

A stability diagram at larger hole number, where the inter-
faces between the carbon nanotube and its contact electrodes
become increasingly transparent towards Fabry-P´erot conduc-
tion [31, 32], is plotted in Fig. 3(a). In absence of the (SU(2))
Kondo effect at even electron number, elastic co-tunneling
enables large conductance in nominal Coulomb blockade re-
gions [33]. For odd electron numbers, Coulomb blockade is
suppressed at low bias, and, as already observed in Fig. 2, sev-
eral of the conductance peaks merge completely into Kondo
ridges. This is also clearly visible in the line plot of Fig. 3(b),
displaying the current at Vsd = −0.1mV.

The subseqent panel, Fig. 3(c), shows the result of me-
chanical resonance detection in the same gate voltage re-
gion, using the same measurement and plotting scheme as
Fig. 1(c), though at much lower driving power (nominally
P = −13.7dBm). The fundamental vibration mode becomes
clearly visible as a diagonal feature. In the plotted gate volt-
age region it displays a near-linear dependence on the gate
voltage Vg, qualitatively different from the observations of,
e.g., [16, 30, 34, 35], where each Coulomb oscillation causes a
strong dip in frequency due to changing electrostatic forces in
response to single charge tunneling at the charge degeneracy
points. This indicates that, due to increased tunnel rates and
lifetime broadening of the involved quantum levels, Coulomb
blockade is gradually lost [29] and that the nanotube more and
more resembles a metallic beam. However, a more detailed
analysis (Fig. 3(d)), where the resonance frequency f0(Vg) has
been extracted and a linear contribution has been removed,
still allows to identify some of the characteristic oscillations
of ω0(Vg), corresponding to the addition of single holes to
the system [16, 29]; selected features are marked in the figure

detection scheme of [13, 16, 22] is used: an antenna several
millimeters from the device radiatively introduces a MHz sig-
nal, and the resulting driven vibration at mechanical resonance
leads to a peak or dip in detected dc-current due to the mod-
ulated displacement of the nanotube and the resulting mod-
ulation in gate capacitance. We observe a strong gate volt-
age dependence of the resonance frequency f0(Vg) due to the
changing tension in the nanotube induced by the pull of the
gate voltage. The resonance from Fig. 1(c) and an additional
second mode at higher frequency are extracted in Fig. 1(d). In
both cases, a parabolic fit provides a good (though strongly
simplified) approximation of the gate voltage dependence in
the measured range (cf. [12, 23] for a more detailed model).

HOLE TRANSPORT REGION

At gate voltages Vg < 0.3V, current is carried by valence
band states, and the quantum dot is charged with an increas-
ing number of holes for decreasing gate voltage. Due to the
absence of abovementioned p-n barriers, the device displays
strong coupling to the metal contacts. This is illustrated in
Fig. 2; note that while the line plot of Fig. 2(a) is logarithmic,
the color scale of Fig. 2(b) is linear. The pronounced sequence
of conductance oscillations at zero bias turns, upon closer ob-
servation, out to be a sequence of Kondo conductance ridges
[6, 24 -- 26] corresponding each to the addition of two holes.
This is particluarly obvious around Vg = −0.03V, −0.11V,

For even larger negative gate voltages, our device unam-
biguously enters the Fabry-P´erot regime, where weak scat-
tering of the electronic wavefunctions at the contacts causes
quantum interference [31]. A detailed discussion of the prop-
erties of the device in this parameter region can be found in
[32].

STRONG COULOMB BLOCKADE

The differential conductance measurements of Fig. 4 cover
the parameter region adjacent to the bandgap towards positive
gate voltage, where few electrons are trapped in the carbon
nanotube. Fig. 4(a) shows the 1 ≤ Nel ≤ 8 region in loga-
rithmic color scale. The diamond-shaped regions of Coulomb

blockade and fixed number Nel of trapped electrons are clearly
visible. Additionally, we observe multiple conductance lines
in the single electron tunneling regions corresponding to ex-
cited quantum states. Already in the Coulomb blockade re-
gion with Nel = 4, further lobe-shaped features appear, be-
coming much stronger at Nel = 6 (see the yellow asterisks in
the figure). These again correspond to vibrational feedback
phenomena typical for clean and suspended carbon nanotube
devices at millikelvin temperatures [16, 22, 27, 28].
Fig. 4(b) continues the plot of Fig. 4(a) towards larger elec-
tron numbers 8 ≤ Nel ≤ 30, now in linear color scale. The
lobe-shaped instability regions now occur repetitively for ev-
ery Coulomb oscillation. In addition, near-horizontal features
in Coulomb blockade, which can be associated with inelas-
tic cotunneling [33] and the non-equilibrium Kondo effect
[6, 25, 36], become increasingly prominent.

A plot of the charging energy Ec(Nel) as function of elec-
tron number Nel is provided in Fig. 4(c). It displays the overall
decrease of Ec with Nel, typical for this type of device, in ad-
dition to "shell-effects" from subsequent filling of quantum
levels analogous to shells in atomic physics. Interestingly, the
shell-filling results in a two-fold pattern for Nel < 16, while
for Nel > 16 a fourfold peak grouping with the largest charg-
ing energy at 4n + 2 is observed. Electron-electron interac-
tion effects are a likely cause of this phenomenon [7], requir-
ing further analysis and potentially additional measurements

Figure 5 illustrates the attempt to resolve the transversal vi-
bration resonance for decreasing electron numbers Nel all the
way to the electronic band gap. Even though a comparatively
large bias of Vsd = 2mV (see Fig. 5(a)) is applied, the res-
onance peaks only remain detectable for Nel ≥ 9, as marked
by an ellipsiod in Fig. 5(b). The peaks are far in the non-
linear response regime, displaying an abrupt edge similar to
a Duffing oscillator response at increasing driving frequency.
For Nel < 9 the resonant response becomes too small to be
detected. To be able to trace the transversal vibration reso-
nance frequency across the low electron number region, and
specifically also the electronic band gap, a different detection
scheme is required.

LARGE ELECTRON NUMBERS

With increasing positive gate voltage Vg and thereby in-
creasing number of trapped electrons Nel, higher order tun-
neling processes become dominant in the transport spectrum.
This is immediately visible in the differential conductance
plots of Figs. 6(a) and (b), where the Kondo effect and (to
a lesser degree) elastic cotunneling increase the signal. While
the conductance trace dI/dVsd(Vg) retains an overall fourfold
repetitive pattern, corresponding to the fourfold occupation of
each longitudinal momentum state in the nanotube confine-
ment potential, the precise shape of the conductance oscil-
lations continuously evolves towards Kondo ridges and sup-
pressed Coulomb blockade.

ductance dI/dVsd(Vg,Vsd) as function of gate voltage Vg and

bias voltage Vsd in the region 77 ≤ Nel ≤ 85, is shown in
Fig. 6(c). A zero bias conductance anomaly becomes clearly
visible at odd electron number, though it is here still compara-
tively weak. An evaluation of the Kondo ridge width, follow-
ing [37], leads to typical Kondo temperatures of 1K ≤ TK ≤
2K at the center of the depicted odd-Nel Coulomb blockade
regions.

Much more dominant in Fig. 6(c) are, however, different ef-
fects. As marked by dashed lines in the figure, strong, discrete
conductance resonances at finite bias pass stepwise through
the Coulomb blockade regions. Going beyond inelastic cotun-
neling, which would lead to a conductance threshold alone,
these lines again correspond to nonequilibrium Kondo phe-
nomena [6, 25, 36]. Similar "stepwise" resonance structures
have been observed before and identified with an imbalance
of the two tunnel barriers connecting a quantum dot to its
leads [38]. Finally, regions of mechanical instability, marked
with asterisks in Fig. 6(c), now consistently occur at nearly
every electron number for bias values above Vsd (cid:39) 0.5mV
and strongly distort the transport spectrum.

CONCLUSIONS

While a clean and suspended carbon nanotube may seem
like a comparatively simple object, its spectroscopy reveals
an immense richness of phenomena in electronics, nanome-
chanics, and the coupling of both. The tunability of the tun-
nel couplings via the gate voltage allows access to a wide
parameter range, from the electronic band gap and strong
Coulomb blockade all the way to higher order tunneling phe-

In nearly all
of these regions nano-electromechanical phenomena can be
identified. A driving signal makes it possible to detect the
transversal vibration resonance frequency from low electron
numbers all the way to the strong Kondo regime; even where
charge quantization is nearly lost, a detailed analysis of the
resonance frequency evolution still allows to characterize the
electronic system via its quantum capacitance. Additionally,
nano-electromechanical feedback effects dominate the current
at finite bias, leading to strongly distorted transport spectra.
The tunability of a single, clean device allows the direct com-
parison of parameter regimes [39], at known electron number
and unchanged molecular structure.
