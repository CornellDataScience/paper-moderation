Quantum theory of spin relaxation in the elastic environment is revised with account of the
concept of a phonon spin recently introduced by Zhang and Niu (PRL 2014). Similar to the case of
the electromagnetic field, the division of the angular momentum associated with elastic deformations
into the orbital part and the part due to phonon spins proves to be useful for the analysis of the
balance of the angular momentum. Such analysis sheds important light on microscopic processes
leading to the Einstein - de Haas effect.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of conservation of angular momentum in
systems containing magnetic moments has been around
since the discovery of Einstein - de Haas1 and Barnett2
effects one hundred years ago. The first effect demon-
strated that the change in the magnetic moment of a feely
suspended body generates mechanical rotation, while the
second demonstrated that mechanical rotation induces
magnetization. For some time the Einstein - de Haas
and Barnett effects were used to measure the gyromag-
netic ratio of solids3. The significance of such measure-
ments was diminished by the discovery of the electron
spin resonance and the ferromagnetic resonance that pro-
vided a more accurate determination of the gyromag-
netic ratio. After that the experiments on macroscopic
magneto-mechanical gyroscopic effects have been largely
abandoned. Surprisingly, however, microscopic mecha-
nisms of the transfer of the spin angular momentum to
the phonon system and subsequently to the body as a
whole remain poorly understood.

The tradition that goes back to the pioneering work on
spin-phonon relaxation by Van Vleck4 consists of ignor-
ing conservation of angular momentum under the excuse
that the Hamiltonian of the system does not possess full
rotational invariance. It is clear, however, that in theory
(and in experiment) the angular momentum in a sys-
tem of interacting spins and phonons is conserved. This
prompted a significant effort by a number of researchers
to formulate the theory of magneto-elastic interactions
in a rotationally invariant manner5 -- 11. The advantage
of such approach is that it is parameter free in a sense
that spin-phonon rates can be expressed in terms of the
well-known independently measured parameters.

Emergence of micro- and nanoelectromechanical de-
vices
to
the problem of angular momentum in magneto-
mechanical systems12. Einstein - de Haas effect at the
nanoscale has been experimentally studied in magnetic
microcantilevers13,14 and theoretically explained by the
motion of domain walls15. Switching of magnetic mo-
ments by mechanical torques in nanocantilevers has been
proposed16 -- 18. Mechanical resonators containing sin-

gle magnetic molecules have been studied by quantum
methods19 -- 23. Experiments have progressed to the mea-
surement of the angular momentum exchange between of
a single molecular spin and a carbon nanotube24,25.

In nanoresonators the problem is somewhat simpler
due to the finite number of resonant modes. For a sin-
gle spin in a macroscopic body, however, the number of
phonon degrees of freedom is practically infinite. In re-
lation to the angular momentum this problem has re-
ceived significant recent attention in experiments with
atomic spin - based qubits26,27 and in application to
spintronics28. To address this problem Zhang and Niu
recently introduced a concept of the phonon spin29.

In this paper we investigate this concept for the pro-
cess of the relaxation of a single atomic spin in a macro-
scopic body. By developing an approach similar to that
for photons we find that within the elastic theory the an-
gular momentum of phonons can be naturally split into
the orbital angular momentum L(1) and the spin angular
momentum L(2). The orbital part corresponds to the ro-
tation of the elastic medium around a certain point, while
the spin part corresponds to a small-radius circular shear
displacements of points of the elastic media around their
equilibrium positions, see Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Conceptual representation of the motion of the elas-
tic medium that generates the orbital angular momentum L(1)
and the phonon spin angular momentum L(2).

The paper is structured as follows. The concept of the
angular momentum in classical and quantum theories of
elasticity is discussed in Section II. Conservation of the

total angular momentum is studied in Section III by com-
puting its commutator with the Hamiltonian. Quantum
dynamics of the angular momentum of the relaxing spin
and emitted phonons is investigated in Section IV. Sec-
tion V contains summary of the results and some final
comments.

When σαβ is non-symmetric, more care is needed. This
can happen for two reasons. The first reason is the intrin-
sic anharmonicity of the elastic theory due to the nonlin-
earity of the strain tensor30,

The angular momentum of the elastic solid is defined

as



L =

d3r (r + u) × p,

(1)

where time-indendent r corresponds to the non-deformed
body, u(r, t) is deformation, and p((r, t) = ρ u((r, t) is the
momentum density. It consists of two parts

L = L(1) + L(2),

(2)

where



L(1) =

d3rρ r × u, L(2) =



d3rρ u × u.

(3)

The orbital part described by L(1) corresponds to the
rotation of the elastic medium around the origin, while
the spin part described by L(2) corresponds to a small-
radius circular shear displacements of points of the elastic
media around their equilibrium positions, see Fig. 1.

Applying time derivative to these expressions one ob-

tains





L(1) =

d3rρ r × u,

L(2) =

d3rρ u × u.

(4)

The dynamical equation for the displacement field is the
Newton's equation

ρ

∂2uα
∂t2 =

∂σαβ
∂rβ

(5)

with the force in the right-hand-side being a gradient of
the stress tensor σαβ = δH/δeαβ. Here H is the Hamilto-
nian of the system and eαβ = ∂uα/∂rβ. After integrating
by parts in equations (4) and assuming zero elastic stress
at the boundary of the body, one obtains




α = −
L(1)

d3rαβγσγβ,

α = −
L(2)

d3rαβγeβδσγδ

(6)
In the linear elastic theory L(1) is zero in the absence
of internal torques due to the symmetry of the stress
tensor. Such torques are ignored by the conventional
elastic theory. L(2), that is quadratic on deformations, is
also neglected in the linear elastic theory, making L = 0.

which is non-symmetric. It is easy to see that in this case
the second term in Eq. (6) is needed for the condition
L = 0 to be exact.

Anharmonicity, however, is not the only reason for σαβ
to be non-symmetric. It also happens in the presence of
spins because spin dynamics generates internal torques.
Consider, e.g., a uniaxial spin Hamiltonian of the form

H = −D (n · S)2

(9)

with n being the magnetic anisotropy axis. Elastic de-
formations of the body rotate the anisotropy axis n by a
small angle φ

φ =

1
2

∇ × u(r), φα =

αβγeγβ.

(10)

To the first order in φ one has n = ez + [φ × ez]. Ex-
panding H up to the linear terms in φ, we get H =
HA + Hs−ph, where HA = −DS2
z and the spin-lattice
coupling is given by31
Hs−ph = −D (SxSz + SzSx) φy + D (SySz + SzSy) φx.
(11)
The corresponding stress tensor σαβ = δH s−ph/δeαβ is
non-symmetric. Writing it as

one obtains

σαβ =

which explicitly expresses the internal mechanical torque
via the elastic twist. The latter comes from the spin-
lattice coupling. In what follows we will show that L(2)
associated with the phonon spin is also generated in the
problem of quantum relaxation of the atomic spin. Con-
sequently, L(2), that is usually neglected in the linear
elastic theory, turns out to be important for the con-
servation of the total angular momentum, even in cases
when the problem is solved with linear non-interacting
phonons.

B. Quantum theory of phonon angular momentum

angular momentum, we use canonical quantization of

The angular momentum of the body, Eq. (1), consists
of two contributions, L = L(1) + L(2) that have been
discussed earlier. Here L(1) is first order in phonon oper-
ators and it can be interpreted as the orbital angular mo-
mentum of the phonons. The term L(2) is second-order in
phonon operators and it can be interpreted as the spin
of the phonons. Splitting the angular momentum into
two parts is similar to that of photons. It will be shown
below that the spin of a phonon is  and the phonon-spin
eigenstates are circularly-polarized phonons.

Each such phonon carries an angular momentum  par-

In what follows we will study conservation of the angu-
lar momentum in the spin-relaxation model by comput-
ing its commutator with the Hamiltonian. Introducing
spin operators S± ≡ Sx ± iSy that follow commutation
relations [S±, Sz] = ±S±, one obtains from Eq. (11)

III. CONSERVATION OF THE ANGULAR

MOMENTUM

Let us now check conservation of the total angular mo-

mentum

J = L + S

(24)
that implies that J must commute with the Hamiltonian.
The dynamical change of the spin operator has to be
absorbed by the angular momentum of the elastic matrix,
whose evolution is given by

(cid:104) Hs−ph, L
(cid:105)

L =

.

(25)

In particular, the precession of the spin around the
anisotropy axis creates the co-wiggling of the elastic ma-
trix with the spin.

It turns out that by commuting operators one can
prove conservation of some parts of the angular momen-
tum, whereas the complete prove of conservation requires
a full quantum-mechanical solution for the relaxing spin
and phonons created by its precession, presented in the
next section. The situation is different for the angular
momentum components perpendicular and parallel to the
anisotropy axis. We will need commutators

will be presented below.

IV. QUANTUM THEORY OF THE RELAXING

SPIN

To facilitate solving the problem of spin-lattice relax-
ation, we reduce the spin-phonon Hamiltonian to the
rotating-wave approximation (RWA) form that conserves
the energy. Consider transitions of the spin m − 1(cid:105) →
m(cid:105) for m > 0 decreasing its energy and call the spin
states 1(cid:105) and 0(cid:105), respectively. With the help of Eq. (22)
one obtains the spin matrix element of this transition

(cid:68)
where lm−1,m ≡ (cid:112)S (S + 1) − m(m − 1). Using Eqs.

(2m − 1) lm−1,mφ+,

(22) and (23), one obtains the RWA coupling in the form

However, Eq.

ing expression is a sum over k, linear in phonon opera-
tors. It is of the same order as the contribution to  Sx,y
due to the spin-phonon interaction, i
, that
was ignored above. Both terms discussed here are much
smaller than the dominant terms in the angular momen-
tum, conserved according to Eq. (32). These small terms
are related to the spin-lattice relaxation of the spin. It is
impossible to prove conservation of these terms without
performing the full quantum-mechanical solution of the
problem of spin relaxation.

V. DISCUSSION

We have analyzed the transfer of the angular momen-
tum from the atomic spin to the orbital and spin angular
momentum of phonons. These two parts of the angular
momentum of the phonon system are clearly distinguish-
able. The orbital part is first order on the phonon oper-
ators. Its classical counterpart is the twist of the elastic
matrix around the position of the atomic spin, which is
linear on the displacement field. The spin part of the
phonon angular momentum is second order on phonon
operators.
Its classical counterpart corresponds to the
rotational shear deformations that are quadratic on the
diplacement field.

Conservation of the angular momentum in the process
of the relaxation of the atomic spin has been demon-
strated by us explicitly. It turns out that the change in
the transverse part of the atomic spin is balanced by the
orbital part of the phonon angular momentum, while the
change in the relaxing longitudinal part of the atomic
spin is balanced by the spin part of the phonon angu-
lar momentum. These findings can be useful in schemes
where individual atomic spins (e.g., used as qubits) are
manipulated by phonons.

An outstanding problem, not addressed in this paper,
is how the orbital and spin angular momenta carried by
phonons get transferred to the rotation of the body as a

whole in the Einstein - de Haas effect. To answer this
question one must recall that in a typical Einstein - de
Haas experiment one induces rotational oscillations of
a macroscopic body by the low frequency ac magnetic
field. The corresponding time scales are much greater
than lifetimes of phonons emitted in atomic spin tran-
sitions. Consequently such phonons fully equilibrate on
the time scale of the transfer of the angular momentum

from atomic spins to the body as a whole.
