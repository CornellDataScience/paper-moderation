The silicon monovacancy in 4H-SiC is a promising candidate for solid-state quantum informa-
tion processing. We perform high-resolution optical spectroscopy on single V2 defects at cryogenic
temperatures. We find favorable low temperature optical properties that are essential for optical
readout and coherent control of its spin and for the development of a spin-photon interface. The
common features among individual defects include two narrow, nearly lifetime-limited optical tran-
sitions that correspond to ms= ± 3/2 and ms= ± 1/2 spin states with no discernable zero-field
splitting fluctuations. Initialization and readout of the spin states is characterized by time-resolved
optical spectroscopy under resonant excitation of these transitions, showing significant differences
between the ±3/2 and ±1/2 spin states. These results are well-described by a theoretical model
that strengthens our understanding of the quantum properties of this defect.

I. INTRODUCTION

Defect centers in wide bandgap materials are candi-
date systems for use in quantum technologies from sens-
ing to computing, as they harness important advantages
of both solid-state and atomic systems [1 -- 3]. Defects
can have sharp optical transitions, strong spin-photon
coupling, and long coherence times while at the same
time allowing for straight-forward nanoscale control and
promising scaling. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in di-
amond, owing to their long history and well-understood
physics, have become the standard platform for defect-
based quantum demonstrations [2, 4, 5]. Despite their
experimental successes, however, NV centers have lim-
itations that have proven difficult to control, from the
complexity of nanofabrication to substantial spectral dif-
fusion [6 -- 8]. These challenges have inspired the search
for a new generation of useful defects.

The deep defects of silicon carbide have generated sig-
nificant interest and shown promise for quantum applica-
tions [9 -- 11]. The most immediate and apparent advan-
tages of silicon carbide lie in its growth and fabrication
maturity relative to diamond [12, 13]. There also exist
several commercially viable polytypes which host dozens
of candidate defects [14]. Among the most attractive de-
fects in SiC are the silicon vacancies VSi, the divacancies
VCVSi, and NV centers [15 -- 23]. There are two silicon
vacancies in 4H-SiC, V1, which has a zero-phonon line
(ZPL) at 862 nm, and V2, which has a ZPL at 916 nm
[24 -- 26]. We focus on the negatively charged V2, which
has room temperature spin coherence (spin echo T2 of
∼100 µs) [16, 17, 27], like NV centers in diamond, but
differentiates itself by having a spin 3/2 ground state,
instead of spin 1 [3, 16, 17, 28].

In this paper, we measure the optical properties of sin-
gle V2 defects at low temperature and develop a theoret-
ical fine structure model that reveals its complete opti-
cal and spin polarization properties for the first time.

We perform high-resolution photoluminescence excita-
tion (PLE) measurements as well as time dependent ex-
periments under resonant optical and radio frequency
(RF) excitation. The PLE spectra of single defects show
two sharp transitions that correspond to the ms = ±3/2
and ms = ±1/2 spin states. Time-resolved PL measure-
ments under resonant and non-resonant laser excitation,
combined with the theoretical model, provide a quanti-
tative understanding of the intersystem crossing and the
spin polarization dynamics. These results provide the
foundation for optical measurement and control of the
V2 defect.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

To study the ZPL of single V2 defects, we perform
high-resolution optical spectroscopy and cryogenic con-
focal microscopy. Experimental details are shown in
Fig. 1(a). The sample is a 18 µm epitaxial film of 4H-SiC
with an n-doping level of 3× 1014 cm−3, grown by chem-
ical vapor deposition on an n-doped substrate, and then
irradiated with 1012 cm−2 2 MeV electrons [29]. The
sample is mounted in a closed-cycle cryostat at ∼4.9 K
with the c-axis oriented nearly perpendicular [30] to the
optical axis, such that optical excitation and collection
are from the cleaved edge of the sample. This geometry
is used because the V2 optical dipole moment is oriented
along the c-axis, and we find that the ZPL emission is
much stronger from the edge. There are two sources of
excitation light: a titanium:sapphire laser at 745 nm,
used for photoluminesence (PL) spectra and to reverse
resonant bleaching, and an external-cavity diode laser
tunable around 916 nm, used for all resonant excitation
experiments. Both lasers are pulsed using acousto-optic
modulators. The two beams are filtered using 850 nm
and 925 nm short pass filters, respectively, and are com-
bined using an 850 nm dichroic mirror. Both beams are

III. RESULTS

A. Single defect emission

Single defects are located by raster scanning a 745 nm
laser and collecting PL to find defects and identify them
as V1 or V2 by their ZPL. The map of one region of the
epitaxial layer is shown in Fig. 1(b), where only emission
at the V2 ZPL is plotted. The sample surface is indicated
by the red dashed line, which shows bright emission of
unknown origin that is not clearly associated with Si va-
cancies. Below the surface, within the epitaxial layer,
there are three bright spots that we attribute to single
V2 defects. While this measurement does not definitively
indentify single emitters, the density is so low that it is
unlikely that two defects are at the same location. PLE
measurements, presented later, indicate that these spots
are single defects. There are about five times as many
V1 defects as V2 defects in the same region. This differ-
ence may be due to electron irradiation on the Si-face,
consistent with previous studies that the V2 ZPL is sig-
nificantly dimmer after Si-face irradiation than after C-
face irradiation [32]. No defect emission is measured in
the substrate, which is likely due to the high n-doping
quenching emission.

A single V2 defect has a sharp ZPL and a wide PSB. A
typical PL spectrum for a V2 defect is shown in Fig. 1(c).
The ZPL at 1352 meV is the strongest, sharpest feature
of the PL spectrum, but there are also two broad peaks
in the PSB before the CCD response falls off around 1000
nm (1240 meV). The upper bound on the Debye-Waller
factor (DWF), the ratio of the light emitted in the ZPL
divided by all of the light emitted by the defect, is about
30% based on integrating the ZPL and the entire spec-
trum of Fig. 1(c). The actual DWF is likely much smaller
due to much of the PSB being at longer wavelengths
where the Si CCD response is poor.

Optical excitation resonant with the V2 ZPL induces
photobleaching of the defect PL that can be recovered by
off-resonant excitation. The photobleaching signal decay
is shown in Fig. 2 in which a 1 mW, 10 ms, 745 nm
laser pulse is followed by a 10 µW, 60 ms, resonant laser
pulse. Under 10 µW of resonant illumination, the sig-
nal from the defect drops exponentially with a 10 ms
time constant. The signal recovers very quickly under off
resonant excitation at 745 nm, faster than the 30 µs res-
olution, so it is used as a repump pulse to keep the defect
photoactive. This high repump power, 1 mW, is used to
demonstrate the constant PL signal on the same scale
as the resonant signal. In general, much less power and
pulse width are needed to repump the defects effectively,
and a power of about 100 µW and a pulse width as small
as 200 ns are used for all other resonant experiments.

FIG. 1. Confocal spectroscopy setup and defect maps. (a)
The sample and objective lens (Obj.) are mounted inside the
cryostat. The sample is mounted on edge relative to the op-
tical axis. The objective is focused inside the epitaxial layer
(darker blue). Two excitation lasers are used. The resonant
laser passes through a 90:10 reflect:transmit non-polarized
beam splitter (BS), then is combined with the repump laser
by an 850 nm dichroic mirror (DM). The lasers are then both
sent into the objective by a two-axis steering mirror (SM)
through a 4f lens system (not pictured). A simple wire loop
around the focal spot applies the RF magnetic field. The
emitted light travels back through the setup and is reflected
off the BS. (b) Typical raster scan of PL reveals single V2
defects where the PL signal intensity at 916 nm is mapped
with a color scale. The red dashed line denotes the surface
of the epitaxial layer. The scale bar is the white rectangle in

focused on the same spot by a 0.75NA objective and are
polarized parallel to the c-axis at the sample. The emit-
ted light, and reflected laser light, is separated from the
excitation path using a 90:10 non-polarizing beam split-
ter and collected by a single-mode fiber that is sent to a
detector.

The optical setup is slightly modified depending on
the measurement. For PL measurements, an 850 nm
long pass filter is used, and the detector is a silicon CCD
spectrometer. For PLE and other resonant experiments
including photobleaching and spin dynamics, a 937 nm
long pass filter removes the excitation lasers and either a
silicon photon-counting avalanche photodiode or super-
conducting nanowire detects signal in the phonon side-
band (PSB) [31]. A radio-frequency (RF) magnetic field
for spin-controlled measurements is produced by short-
ing the inner conductor of a coax cable to the outer con-
ductor, and the loop is stretched over the sample edge
so that the RF magnetic field is largely perpendicular to
the c-axis. All experiments are performed at zero applied

FIG. 2. Bleaching measurement. (top) The pulse sequence for
the measurement: 10 ms of 1 mW 745 nm light followed by 60
ms of 10 µW resonant light. (bottom) Time trace of the PL
from a single defect. The PL is constant at the millisecond
timescale under 745 nm illumination. During the resonant
pulse, the PL from the defect decays away exponentially with
a time scale of 10 ms.

This photobleaching effect is seen in all V2 defects mea-
sured, and the bleaching time constant is generally in the
tens of milliseconds. We suspect that this photobleach-
ing is related to photoionization of the V2− charge state
similar to that in NV− centers in diamond [8, 33, 34],
although there has been no reported observation or iden-
tification of the ZPL of the V20 or V22− charge states.
The charge state of both the VSi and VCVSi in SiC have
previously been shown to be affected by excitation with
different wavelengths [35, 36]. Another possible mecha-
nism for this photobleaching is optical spin pumping, but
we will show that this occurs on much shorter timescales,
and the signal can be recovered using RF excitation.

B. Photoluminescence Excitation Spectra

The optical spectrum of the V2 ZPL is measured with
high resolution PLE. The resonant laser is tuned across
the ZPL of a defect while the laser frequency is measured
by a high-resolution wavemeter. To prevent bleaching,
the pulse sequence consists of an 8 µs repump pulse fol-
lowed by a 40 µs resonant pulse with a 1 µs delay between
the pulses. The emitted light signal is only counted dur-
ing the resonant pulse. Without the repump pulse, no
signal is observed.

The PLE from the V2 defect has two sharp lines con-
sistent with the spin sublevels of the ground (GS) and
excited states (ES). A typical PLE spectrum and energy
level schematic is shown in Fig. 3(a, b). The two sharp
peaks arise from nominally spin-conserving optical tran-

and theoretical PLE spectrum of a typical single V2 defect

axis is offset by 1352.8461 meV and the resonant laser power

transitions, are associated with optical transitions of either
the ±3/2 or ±1/2 states. (b) Simplified energy level diagram

sitions between the ground and excited states. At zero
magnetic field, the spin-3/2 ground state is split into two
doubly-degenerate sublevels, ms=± 1/2 and ms=± 3/2,
separated by a zero field splitting (ZFS) of 70 MHz due
to spin-spin interactions among the active electrons of
the defect [17, 20, 37, 38]. Similarly, the spin-3/2 excited
state is also split with a ZFS of 1 GHz [39]. Although
the ground and excited state ZFSs have been previously
shown to have the same sign [40], the overall sign is still
debated. We initially classify these sharp peaks as the
"red" and "blue" peaks on the left and right, due to
their respective energies, respectively, with correspond-
ing ground (gi) and excited (ei) states. Later, we iden-
tify these red and blue peaks to be ms = ±3/2 and ±1/2
spin states, respectively, based on their distinct spin po-
larization properties. The blue peak is slightly stronger
and narrower than the red peak, with full-widths at half-
maxima (FWHMs) of 65 MHz and 80 MHz, respectively,
which is not much larger than the radiative limit of the
linewidth of about 24 MHz (from a fluorescence lifetime
of 6.1 ns) [15]. The splitting between the red and blue
transitions is 1.03 GHz, which is consistent with the sum
of the ground and excited state ZFSs.

The blue peak
of the defects has an ensemble average of 1352.85 meV
and a standard deviation of 40 µeV (10 GHz), but the
splitting between the two peaks has an ensemble average
of 1.03 GHz with a standard deviation of 10 MHz, limited
by stability of the wavemeter used to measure the exci-
tation frequency. The blue and red peaks have FWHM
averages of 170 and 200 MHz, respectively, but with rel-
atively large standard deviations of about 100 MHz. No
spectral diffusion at timescales longer than a measure-
ment (on the order of minutes) was observed. These ob-
servations are consistent with low strain and electric field
sensitivity of the ZFS [28], and also indicate small ground
and excited state permanent dipole moments as expected
from symmetrically near-Td charge distributions [20].

The detailed fine structure of the V2 defect is shown
in Fig. 4(a) in the absence of any magnetic field. The
ms=±3/2 and ms=±1/2 channels have the same orbital
dipole moment and, therefore, have the same radiative
decay rates from the ES to the GS. The spin polarization
properties and the unique features in the PLE spectra
are governed by the phonon-assisted non-radiative inter-
system crossing (ISC) processes that are due to direct
spin-orbit couplings (DSO) of the E symmetry doublet
state (DS) to the A symmetry GS and ES. This leads
to four primary ISC rates that need to be determined in
order to fully understand the optical properties of this
defect. The non-radiative rates that are associated with
the decay from the ES to the DS (entry channel) are la-
beled as γ1 and γ2 for each spin channel. Similarly, the
decay rates from the DS back to the GS (exit channel)
are labeled as γ3 and γ4. We obtain the relationship be-
tween different spin channels within each entry and exit
channels by evaluating the corresponding DSO coupling
matrix elements, e.g. γi = 2π(cid:104)ψDS
(cid:105)2/
within the symmetry adapted wave-functions basis of
each j active electrons [20].
In addition, we find that
the entry channel ISC rates are ≈2.65 times faster than
the exit channels taking the relative energy of the DS
with respect to GS and ES into account [20]. As a result,
we obtain the following relationship among all the ISC
rates,

and show that ms=± 3/2 spin states always have 3 times
faster non-radiative decay rate than the ms=±1/2 states.
The PLE spectra as a function of resonant laser power
are shown in Fig. 4(b). At lower resonant laser powers,
Pres, we observe two small sharp peaks. At higher powers
there is a broad central peak that dominates the spec-
trum at the highest powers. These sharp peaks in PLE
spectra can only occur in the presence of spin relaxation
that limits the effects of optical pumping. For instance,
resonant excitation of the red transition will eventually
lead to the defect transitioning through the ISC to g2, a

4

dark state under red excitation. Similarly, resonant op-
tical excitation of the blue transition eventually leads to
optical pumping into g1. Therefore, to overcome optical
pumping and observe a measurable signal during PLE,
the ground state spin must relax reasonably quickly or
the laser must be able to excite the opposite transition.
Some effective spin relaxation occurs from the periodic
repump pulses, but for moderate to high resonant powers,
the detuned excitation of the opposite transition plays
the biggest role.

The PLE spectra are accurately reproduced in Fig. 4(c)
by using the theoretical fine structure model of this de-
fect shown in Fig. 4(a). In order to obtain the PLE signal
theoretically, the steady state excited state populations
are calculated from the following Lindblad master equa-

operators, i.e. L(A) = AρA† −(cid:8)A†A, ρ(cid:9) /2 for any oper-

in the rotating frame of the PLE laser with a frequency
detuned by δL from the ZPL and a Rabi amplitude of
ΩL. Our model does not assume the sign of the GS and
ES ZFS but only that they have the same sign, which has
previously been demonstrated [41]. The ZFS sign and all
the relevant decay rates (see Table I) are obtained later
by applying this fine structure model to the time resolved
spin polarization and readout measurements, which will
be explained later. The ZFS of the GS and ES are 2Dg
and 2De, respectively. We note that the E doublet with
doubly degenerate d1 and d2 spin states is the only dou-
blet that is allowed to couple to both GS and ES via
ISC. Any additional spin-mixing effects stemming from
the DSO couplings of this doublet with the remaining
four energetically close doublets (A1, A2, 2E) [20] are in-
cluded in the parameter λ. The radiative decays are

state defined in MR = g1(cid:105)(cid:104)g2 + c.c. due to the repump
laser and the intrinsic spin dephasing rate γs of the dou-
blet states, i.e. Ms = d1(cid:105)(cid:104)d1 − d2(cid:105)(cid:104)d2. γs and λ are
found to be large enough that the doublet states are com-
pletely mixed. Dephasing of the GS spin is not included
as it is typically on a longer time scale than the dynamics
considered here, and it should not affect the population
dynamics.

The amplitude difference in the sharp peaks can be un-
derstood from the different ISC rates of the ms= ± 3/2
and ms=± 1/2 spin channels (see Eq. 1). The faster ISC
rate of the ms=± 3/2 excited states causes more popula-
tion to be removed non-radiatively from these states per
optical cycle compared to the ms= ± 1/2 states. There-
fore, the ms= ± 3/2 excited states have smaller steady
state populations than the ms= ± 1/2 excited states,
when the laser is on or near resonant with their corre-
sponding transitions, leading to a reduced PLE signal
from that peak. As a result, we identify the smaller
sharp peak as the ms= ± 3/2 states leading to a neg-
ative ZFS (D < 0) for the ES and the GS. This identifi-
cation will be corroborated by our time-dependent spin
polarization and readout measurements. As the Pres is
increased, as expected by the model, the sharp peaks
get stronger and broader while the amplitude difference
between them increases before finally saturating. In ad-
dition, a broad peak, that increases in amplitude and
linewidth with increasing power, appears. This broad
peak, which is prominent only at higher Pres, is due to
off-resonant excitation of both the red and blue transi-
tions, which is strongest in between the two transitions.
Symmetric excitation of both transitions prevents opti-
cal pumping. This leads to a stationary center frequency
that remains halfway between the sharp peaks and a peak

area that increases linearly before beginning to saturate
at about 50 µW. The sharp peaks also appear to move to-
ward the center at higher powers for reasons that are not
yet clear. One possibility is that strong resonant driving
modifies the charge environment surrounding the defect,
causing electric field induced changes to the ZFS.

C. Time-resolved spin dynamics

The dynamics of this system under laser excitation are
measured using RF pulses and time-resolved PL. The
integrated PSB emission is measured as a function of
time and for a series of resonant laser powers, shown in
Fig. 5(a,b). A 1.5 µs, 72.5 MHz RF pulse, resonant with
the ground state ZFS [42] is applied before the resonant
laser pulse to equalize the spin polarization left over from
the previous resonant laser pulse. The RF pulse length
and power are adjusted with the intent to equalize the
spin populations when Rabi oscillations are damped out,
but this may not be entirely the case. Regardless, the RF
pulse at least partially equalizes spin states and allows
observation of the PL decay. The resonant laser pulse is
locked by the wavemeter to either the red or blue transi-
tion at every given Pres. A short repump pulse long after
the dynamics have reached their steady-states prevents
the defect from bleaching. Both excitation laser frequen-
cies initially show strong PSB emission that decays very
rapidly due to the ISC and optical spin polarization. The
PL does not decay to zero due to off-resonant excitation
of the other ground state, giving rise to steady state emis-
sion. Spin relaxation should also contribute to the steady
state emission at low powers.

Driving the two transitions resonantly leads to very dif-
ferent time dependences. Decay rate results are shown

excitation, blue or red, there are two primary parameters,
the excited state-to-intermediate state decay rate (γ2 or
γ1), and the intermediate state-to-opposite ground state
decay rate (γ3 or γ4). The former determines how fast
the defect can leave the resonant radiative transition cy-
cle (related to how well optical spin readout works), and
latter determines how likely the defect is to relax to the
other dark ground state, leaving the radiative transition
cycle (related to the rate of optical pumping). The differ-
ent time dependences of red and blue excitations can be
explained very well using the model in Fig. 4(a) and the
relationships in Eq. 1. PL decay curves obtained from
this model are plotted in Fig. 5(a,b), showing very good
agreement with experiment. For the red excitation, as
the γ1 decay rate is faster than both the γ3 and γ4, the
defect spends a significant fraction of a cycle in the DS,
which leads to a quick decrease in luminescence (due to
population moving into the DS) that occurs "in series"
with the optical pumping. Therefore, the decay of red
excitation exhibits a biexponential time dependence. On
the other hand, for the blue excitation, since the γ2 decay
rate is comparable to the γ3 decay rate, the spin polarizes
to the other dark ground state nearly as quickly as it de-
cays into the DS, and so only one rate is observed. These
results significantly strengthen the assignment of the red
and blue transitions to the ms= ±3/2 and ms= ±1/2
states, respectively.

Understanding spin dynamics under non-resonant laser
excitation is also valuable, due to its common use in po-
larizing and reading out V2 and its use in preventing
bleaching of emission. As shown in Fig. 6, a combination
of a non-resonant/repump (745 nm) pulse and a resonant
pulse on the red or blue transition are used to study these
dynamics.

Both pulses of the sequence serve to readout and po-
larize the ground state spin, but the resonant laser acts
more selectively. In the red pulse sequence, just before
the repump pulse turns on at t = 0, the defect has pri-
marily been optically pumped into g2 by the red-tuned
laser. Just after the repump pulse begins which excites
both transitions, the PL signal in Fig. 6(a) starts at a
slightly higher value than the steady state signal at t = 5
µs. For the blue pulse sequence, the defect has primar-
ily been pumped into g1, and the PL signal in Fig. 6(b)
starts at a slightly lower value than the steady state. This
behavior is consistent with the results from Fig. 5, which
show that the non-radiative ISC processes are faster for
e1 than e2, so more photons are collected when starting
in g2 compared to starting in g1. The difference in PL
signal, integrating over the 1/e decay time (1.2 µs), is
18%. This contrast is much larger than the 2% seen in
room temperature single defect ODMR [16], but is still
relatively small compared to resonant readout because
contrast is only due to the differences in the non-radiative
ISC processes. It is also possible that there may be other
luminescent defects within the laser spot that contribute

in Fig. 5(d). Under blue excitation after the RF pulse,
the signal can be fit very well with a single exponential,
giving a single polarization rate kb. Under red excitation
after the RF pulse, however, the signal requires a biexpo-
nential fit, which yields to two polarization rates, kr,fast
and kr,slow. As expected, the spin polarization rates in-
crease with increasing power. At 10 µW red excitation,
however, only the fast rate is observed.

The decay rates as a function of optical power help give
an intuitive picture for the spin-dependent ISC coupling
constants and further support the theoretically obtained
relationship (Eq. 1) among these rates. These coupling
constants determine optically-pumped ground state spin
polarization. As shown in Fig. 4(a), for a given resonant

to the signal, artificially lowering the contrast.

We also apply the theoretical model of Eq. 2 and Eq. 3
to these sequences of resonant and non-resonant pulses.
The comparison to experiment for these sequences is very
valuable for determining the system parameters and for
visualizing the populations that cannot be separately
measured experimentally. The theoretical PL signal in
Fig. 6(a,b) is calculated by evaluating the time depen-
dent excited state populations of e1 and e2 as a function
of two decay rates, γr and γ1, where the ratio between
all the ISC rates is kept fixed according to Eq. 1. Fit-
ting these solutions to the experimental data reveals all
the previously unknown radiative and non-radiative de-
cay rates of the V2 defect that are shown in Table I. In
addition, these calculated rates result in an overall fluo-
rescence lifetime of 5.82 ns (i.e. 1/γF = 1/γr + 4/γ1) in
good agreement with previous measurements [15].

We also conclude that both the GS and the ES ZFS
are negative (Dg < 0, De < 0) as the red excitation
with higher ISC rate corresponds to the ms = ±3/2 spin
states (see Eq. 1). The population of each state is plotted
in Fig. 6(c, e) and Fig. 6(d, f) for the red and blue res-
onant laser, respectively. During the repump laser, the
initial g1 or g2 population is pumped toward a modest
g1 polarization, which reaches a population of 0.59 after
the laser is off and all population is returned to the GS.
This polarization occurs because of faster decay from the
doublets to g1 than g2. During the resonant pulse, po-
larization occurs very rapidly toward g1 or g2, with the

g1 (g2) population reaching 0.92 (0.84) for blue (red) ex-
citation after the pulse is turned off. These values are
limited by off-resonant excitation of the opposite tran-
sition. Based on this model, using lower resonant laser
powers of ≈15 nW and pulse lengths of 4 µs, the ini-
tialization fidelity into g1 (g2) can be 0.9996 (0.9993) for
blue (red) excitation.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The results of this article are relevant to applications in
quantum technology, particularly for quantum networks
[11, 43], which require fast, high fidelity initialization, ef-
ficient spin readout, stable, homogeneous emission into
the ZPL, and the proper energy level structure. As just
stated, the initialization fidelity for V2 looks very promis-
ing under the right excitation conditions. Fast initial-

Time (µs)Time (µs)Signal (kcps)Population (×100%)Repump laserRed resonant laser(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)(f)Repump laserBlue resonant laserization requires a rapid change in the spin state under
optical excitation, which is true for both transitions.

Aside from efficient photon collection, the key to spin
readout is to preserve the spin state under optical excita-
tion, opposite the requirement for initialization. Readout
of the spin state is better for the blue transition since the
ISC rate to the doublet is 3 times slower than for the red
transition, meaning more photons can be emitted before
the defect changes spin state. The blue transition, how-
ever, does not operate very well as a cycling transition
since the ISC is still relatively strong. When starting in
the g2 (ms = ±1/2) state, we estimate that about 8 pho-
tons should be emitted when driving the blue transition
before the emission decays to 1/e of its initial value. This
behavior is in contrast to the S = 1 divacancy in SiC and
NV− in diamond, in which an ES for the ms = 0 GS has a
weak ISC for low strain-induced mixing of excited states
[22, 44], giving long PL decay times for efficient spin read-
out. Furthermore, for the V2 VSi our model shows that
the long lifetime of the DS (γ3 < γr, and γ4 < γr) lim-
its the overall brightness by causing some population to
become trapped in the DS (see Fig. 6(e,f)).
Integra-
tion of these defects into cavities should improve read-
out by increasing the collection efficiency and by Purcell
enhancement of the radiative transitions relative to the
ISC. Cavity enhancement of different optical transitions
in semiconductor QDs has been successful in improving
the fidelity of both readout and initialization [45 -- 47].

Obtaining homogeneous emission into the ZPL de-
pends on having little emission into the PSB, little vari-
ation in emission energy between defects, and little spec-
tral diffusion of individual defects. More than 70% of the
emission from V2 is in the PSB, but this is still likely bet-
ter than 97% for the NV center [48]. The inhomogeneous
variation in emission energy, which we attribute to local
variations in strain and electric field, and the measured
linewidths of single defects, broadened by fluctuations in
the environment, are roughly comparable to that of high
quality diamond NV center samples [49, 50], but we ex-
pect these may be improved using different irradiation
conditions and annealing.

The energy level structure required depends on the ap-
plication. For spin-photon entanglement, Λ energy level
systems are often used for polarization [50] or frequency
[51] encoding of the photon, but entanglement can also
be achieved without a Λ system using time-bin encoding
of photons, as has been demonstrated with NV centers in
diamond [5, 52]. This time bin approach appears feasible
with the current V2 energy level structure. The gener-
ation of entangled photon states (e.g. cluster states or
GHZ states) has been studied for both Λ systems [53]
and double two level systems with orthogonal polariza-
tions [20, 54, 55], both of which would require additional
additional work to achieve with V2.

The resonant optical experiments presented here pro-
vide the essential foundation for an interface between the

8

coherent GS spin system of the V2 VSi and photons. The
spin system has already been shown to have long coher-
ence times, up to 10s of milliseconds at low temperatures
with dynamical decoupling [27]. The combination of this
spin memory with sharp, stable optical transitions, fast
initialization, and potentially strong emission into the
ZPL make it quite promising as an optically active spin
qubit. The ability to integrate this defect into the tech-
nologically mature SiC material system is attractive as
well.

After submission of this article, a related paper ap-
peared studying resonant optical excitation of the V1 VSi
[56], with complementary results.
