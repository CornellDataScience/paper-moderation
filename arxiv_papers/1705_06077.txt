Abstract 

Electrons in two-dimensional graphene sheets behave as interacting chiral Dirac fermions and 

have unique screening properties due to their symmetry and reduced dimensionality.  By using a 

combination of scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements and theoretical modeling we 

have characterized how graphene's massless charge carriers screen individual charged calcium 

atoms.  A back-gated graphene device configuration has allowed us to directly visualize how the 

screening length for this system can be tuned with carrier density.  Our results provide insight 

into electron-impurity and electron-electron interactions in a relativistic setting with important 

consequences for other graphene-based electronic devices.

Understanding how screening arises from different contributions to the static dielectric 

[2,3], as well as electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions [4,5].   Because it is two-

dimensional, graphene provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of screening using 

spatial imaging techniques while simultaneously employing gate tunability to vary charge carrier 

density. The chiral relativistic nature of graphene's charge carriers [6] cause it to have a peculiar 

screening behavior: undoped graphene is dielectric-like while doped graphene is metal-like [7,8].  

Consequently, it is possible to directly image electronic screening processes in graphene over a 

wide range of different screening regimes. 

The screening of charged impurities is of particular importance to the performance of 

graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) [3,9].  Charged impurities, for example, can limit carrier 

mobility [2,10-12], shift the chemical potential [13], induce phase transitions [14-16], create 

supercritical states [17-20], and split Landau levels [21].  Although the interaction between 

graphene and isolated charged elements such as adsorbates [22-25] and defects [26,27] has been 

investigated with local probe techniques in the past, there are currently no spatially-resolved 

studies of the carrier-density-dependence of electronic screening of charged impurities in 

graphene.  Here we present a systematic scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy 

(STM/STS) study of the local screening response of gate-tunable graphene to individual charged 

calcium (Ca) adatoms.  We find that charged impurities in graphene are screened by chiral Dirac 

fermions over an atypically long length scale on the order of ten nanometers.  This screening 

length is highly dependent on carrier density and is thus tunable via gate voltage.  Our spatially-

resolved measurements of screening behavior in graphene are in good agreement with theoretical 

simulations of the electronic response of doped graphene to the presence of a screened Coulomb 

 

2 

potential.  These results demonstrate the importance of electron-electron interactions (which give 

rise to screening) for understanding the properties of defects in doped graphene. 

We fabricated gate-tunable graphene/boron nitride (BN) devices by growing monolayer 

graphene via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [28] and transferring the graphene onto BN 

crystals [29] exfoliated onto SiO2/Si wafers.  The BN flakes were used as atomically smooth 

substrates [30,31] with reduced charge inhomogeneity compared to SiO2 [32,33].  Ca atoms were 

subsequently deposited onto the surface of our liquid helium cooled graphene/BN devices in an 

ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber (see Supplementary Materials and Ref. [34]).  Fig. 1a depicts 

the graphene device used in our experimental setup.  Fig. 1b shows a typical STM topographic 

image of graphene following this Ca deposition procedure.  The Ca atoms appear as identical 

round protrusions on the graphene surface and are surrounded by a dark depression caused by the 

rearrangement of local density of states (LDOS) spectral weight above and below the Dirac 

point.  This is a signature of the graphene screening response to the presence of charged Ca 

adatoms [23]. 

In order to determine the charge state of the Ca atoms at different doping levels we 

performed gate-dependent dI/dV spectroscopy on graphene at various distances away from an 

isolated Ca atom (i.e., a Ca atom separated by at least 20 nm from all other Ca atoms).  This data 

is plotted in Figs 2a-c for p-doped, nearly neutral, and n-doped graphene.  Each dI/dV curve here 

has been normalized by a different constant to account for the exponential dependence of the 

tunneling conductance on tip height [23].  All dI/dV curves show a ~130 meV wide gap-like 

feature at the Fermi level caused by phonon-assisted inelastic tunneling [35,36], and the p-doped 

(n-doped) spectra exhibit local minima on the right (left) side of the Fermi level that reflect the 

 

3 

graphene Dirac point.  For the nearly neutral graphene spectra, the Dirac point is near the Fermi 

level and its location is obscured by the ~130 meV gap-like feature. 

The dI/dV curves in Figs 2a-c all display an electron-hole asymmetry in which the dI/dV 

intensity at energies above the Dirac point increases as the STM tip approaches the Ca atom, 

while the dI/dV intensity at energies below the Dirac point decreases as the tip approaches the Ca 

atom.  This observation is consistent with previous theoretical predictions that the electronic 

LDOS of graphene increases for energies above the Dirac point as one approaches a positively 

charged Coulomb center while it decreases for energies below the Dirac point [18,19].  We thus 

conclude that the Ca atom is positively charged and stable regardless of the graphene doping 

level within our experimental conditions.  dI/dV spectra taken directly above individual Ca atoms 

confirm that there are no electronic resonances of the atom in the energy range near the Fermi 

level explored here, consistent with the charge stability displayed in Figs 2a-c (see 

Supplementary Information). 

The charge stability of Ca atoms for different gating conditions allows us to image 

graphene's screening response to charged impurities over a wide range of doping levels.  Figures 

3a-c show gate-dependent dI/dV maps near a single, positively charged Ca atom as the p-doping 

in graphene is progressively increased by ramping up the gate voltage (the sample bias (Vs) was 

changed at each gate voltage (Vg) to ensure that only electron-like states 0.15 eV above the Dirac 

point were tracked in all three dI/dV maps).  Figure 3a shows the dI/dV map at the smallest gate 

voltage where the graphene has a p-type charge carrier density of ~3 x 1011 cm-2.  The yellow 

region shows the increased electron-like LDOS that occurs as graphene charge carriers rearrange 

themselves in response to the screened Coulomb potential of the positively charged Ca atom.  

Figure 3b shows the same region of graphene after raising the density of p-type charge carriers to 

 

4 

~1.8 √ó 1012 cm-2.  The yellow region is seen to decrease in size as the increased charge carrier 

density more effectively screens the Ca atom and reduces the range of its associated Coulomb 

potential.  Figure 3c shows the same region after increasing the p-type carrier density even 

further to ~3.5 √ó 1012 cm-2.  Increased screening is seen to shrink the region of higher electronic 

LDOS around the Ca atom even further.  In order to more accurately quantify these trends we 

measured dI/dV line scans as a function of distance from the Ca atom.  These line scans, shown 

in Fig. 3d, were obtained at the same energy as the dI/dV maps of Figs. 3a-c and clarify how the 

graphene LDOS is modified by the screened Ca Coulomb potential for different p-type dopant 

levels.  The characteristic decay length of the LDOS measured in the line scans is seen to 

decrease as the p-type graphene carrier density increases. 

The results for n-doped graphene similarly show the effect on screening as charge carrier 

density is increased.  Figures 4a-c show dI/dV maps of the same region as Fig. 3, but for different 

n-doping carrier densities.  Here Vs was adjusted so that only hole-like states 0.08 eV below the 

Dirac point (ED) are imaged (LDOS energies on opposite sides of ED were chosen for n- and p-

doped graphene to avoid the phonon gap-like feature, thereby allowing states near ED to be 

characterized with greater precision).  Figure 4a shows the graphene response to a single Ca 

atom for the smallest number of n-type charge carriers: ~0.5 √ó 1011 cm-2.  Since states below ED 

are imaged here the contrast is flipped compared to the images of Figs. 3a-c (we emphasize that 

this is not a result of the polarity of charge carriers in graphene).  Figures 4b and 4c show how 

the n-type screening response to the Ca atom increases as carrier density is ramped up to 

~1.4√ó1012 cm-2.  The blue region is seen to shrink as the Coulomb potential range reduces with 

increased screening.  dI/dV line scans were also obtained in the vicinity of the Ca atom at the 

same energy as the dI/dV maps, but for different n-type carrier densities. As seen in Fig. 4d, the 

 

5 

presence of the Ca atom strongly reduces the graphene LDOS near the atom but the LDOS 

returns to its unperturbed value at large distances.  The length scale over which this occurs (i.e., 

the screening length) is seen to decrease for increased n-type carrier densities, similar to what is 

observed in the case of p-type charge carrier densities (Fig. 3d). 

Our observation that the decay length of dI/dV decreases with increasing carrier 

concentration can be qualitatively understood via Thomas-Fermi screening theory.  In three-

dimensional (3D) metals the static wave-vector (q) dependent Thomas-Fermi dielectric function 

is

decrease of the decay length of dI/dV for both p-doped (Fig. 3) and n-doped (Fig. 4) graphene. 

This simple Thomas-Fermi screening picture, however, has several shortcomings.  First, 

Second, Thomas-Fermi theory is only valid for slowly varying potentials and for energies far 

from the graphene Dirac point.  Third, it does not directly predict the electronic LDOS, which is 

most closely related to the experimentally measured quantity dI/dV.  Therefore, to more 

quantitatively and realistically explain our STM measurements, we carried out theoretical 

calculations for a doped graphene sheet with a single Ca adatom.  We used a nearest-neighbor 

tight-binding model to account for graphene electronic structure and a screened Coulomb 

potential to describe the Ca adatom.  Here the bare Coulomb potential is screened using the

Figures 2d-f show the results of our simulated dI/dV point spectra for p-doped, nearly 

neutral, and n-doped graphene (each colored curve corresponds to a different distance from the 

Ca atom).  Quasiparticle lifetime effects and inelastic tunneling processes have been included 

(see Ref. [36] for details on this procedure; the Supplementary Information shows theoretical 

curves without lifetime and inelastic tunneling effects).  In agreement with the experimental data 

(Figs 2a-c), the computed spectra exhibit a significant electron-hole asymmetry when the tip is 

brought closer to the adatom; the simulated LDOS increases above the Dirac point and decreases 

below the Dirac point for closer distances. 

An intuitive picture for understanding these findings is that the LDOS of graphene in the 

presence of the charged impurity is described by the LDOS of unperturbed graphene, but shifted 

towards lower energies by the local value of the screened Coulomb potential.  This explains the 

reduction of dI/dV below the Dirac point and its increase above the Dirac point. We find that a 

shifted LDOS is in good agreement with our calculations for energies sufficiently far from the 

Dirac point (see Supplementary Information).  In the vicinity of the Dirac point, however, this 

intuitive picture breaks down.  In particular, the Dirac point itself does not shift in energy ‚Äì a 

consequence of the linear dispersion of the graphene Dirac bands [18]. 

To model our experimental dI/dV maps and better visualize the spatial dependence of the 

screening behavior we calculated the theoretical tunneling conductance as a function of distance 

away from a Ca adatom at fixed energy.  Figures 3e and 4e show simulated dI/dV versus distance 

for p-doped and n-doped graphene, respectively.  The energies and charge carrier densities n 

were chosen such that Fig. 3e directly corresponds to Fig. 3d, and Fig. 4e to Fig. 4d.  In 

agreement with the experimental results shown in Figs 3d and 4d, the theoretical spatial profile 

of the tunnel conductance decays more rapidly for higher doping levels (for both p-doped and n-

 

8 

doped graphene), directly reflecting the reduced range of the impurity potential caused by a 

reduced screening length.  We also carried out large-scale first-principles calculations of the 

calcium-graphene system within a density functional theory (DFT) framework as implemented in 

the ONETEP code [42,43], which confirm the trends obtained from the tight-binding model (see 

Supplementary Information). 

These results directly confirm that the RPA model accurately describes screening in 

graphene.  RPA screening has already played an essential ingredient in early theoretical models 

of bipolar electron transport in graphene, as it explains the V-shaped conductivity as a function 

of gate voltage [44-46].  Screening of charged impurities causes long-range impurity scattering 

to dominate graphene's transport properties at low carrier concentration and short-range impurity 

scattering to dominate at high carrier concentration [2].  Our data for the simplest possible 

charged impurity system ‚Äì a single, isolated impurity on graphene ‚Äì allows us to directly 

visualize this phenomenon and confirm these assumptions. 

In conclusion, we have explored how relativistic charge carriers in graphene screen a 

single Coulomb potential for different carrier densities.  Direct STM/STS measurements of the 

local electronic structure of gate-tunable graphene in the presence of isolated Ca adatoms have 

allowed us to directly observe how the screening length of graphene decreases with increasing 

charge carrier density.  Unlike conventional 2DEGs, where the Thomas-Fermi screening length 

ùúÜ?8 is independent of carrier density [47], graphene's Dirac-like band structure leads to ùúÜ?8‚àù
1/ ùëõ .  This experimental trend is confirmed by a tight-binding model of graphene 

incorporating a screened Coulomb potential.  The fundamental behavior described here (as well 

as visualization techniques) can be generalized to other electrostatic potentials, such as graphene 

 

9 

pn junctions [48-51], quantum dots [52,53], and superlattices [54-60] where the potential 

landscape felt by graphene charge carriers is altered by density-dependent screening effects.
