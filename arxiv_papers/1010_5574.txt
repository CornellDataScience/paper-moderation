Abstract

We study a confined system of Dirac fermions in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic
field. Splitting the system into different regions, we determine their corresponding energy spectrum
solutions. We underline their physical properties by considering the conservation energy where
some interesting relations are obtained. These are used to discuss the reflexion and transmission
coefficients for Dirac fermions and check the probability condition for different cases. We generalize
the obtained results to a system with gap and make some analysis. After evaluating the current-
carrying states, we analyze the Klein paradox and report interesting discussions.

Introduction

The Dirac formalism plies an important role not only from mathematical point of view but physical
one as well. The recent observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene [1, 2] renewed
the interest to this formalism. In fact, many questions, raised in graphene, found their solutions by
adopting the Dirac formalism as cornerstone. Among them, we cite the confinement [3] that is much
needed to describe the transport properties in graphene. Subject that attracted much attention where
interesting developments appeared by dealing with different issues, for instance we refer to [4, 5].

On the other hand, the quantum wires (electron waveguides) with quantized conductance can
be formed in graphene [6]. Such electron waveguides are indispensable parts of any conceivable all-
graphene device. In lithographically formed graphene ribbons, the electronic bandstructure is theoret-
ically expected to very sensitively depend on the width and on details of the boundary [7]. On top of
that, disorder and structural inhomogeneity are substantial in real graphene [8]. For narrow graphene
ribbons or electrostatically formed graphene wires [9], conventional conductance quantization thus
seems unlikely [10]. This expectation is in accordance with recent experiments [11].

Magnetic barrier technology is well developed [12, 13, 14] and its application to graphene sam-
ples appears to pose no fundamental problems [6]. In fact, snake states are experimentally studied
in other materials [12, 15], mainly motivated by the quest for electrical rectification. On the theory
side, the confined Schrodinger fermions in the magnetic field (with B′ = 0) is discussed [16] as well
as the asymmetric cases [17]. For the Dirac-Weyl quasiparticles encountered in graphene, however,
such calculations are not reported. The inhomogeneous magnetic field case in graphene is analyzed
in [18]. Theoretically, the electron waveguides, in graphene created by suitable inhomogeneous mag-
netic fields, is considered [6]. The properties of uni-directional snake states are discussed. For a certain
magnetic field profile, two spatially separated counter-propagating snake states are formed, leading to
conductance quantization insensitive to backscattering by impurities or irregularities of the magnetic
field.

Subsequently, The tunneling effect of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in a constant magnetic field
is studied [19]. This is done by using the continuity equation at fixed points to determine the corre-
sponding reflexion and transmission coefficients. For this, a system made of graphene, as superposition
of two different regions where the second is characterized by an energy gap t', is considered. In fact,
concrete systems are treated to practically give two illustrations: barrier and diode. For each case,
the transmission in terms of the ratio of the energy conservation and t' are discussed. Moreover, the
resonant tunneling by introducing a scalar Lorentz potential is analyzed where it is shown that a total
transmission is possible.

Motivated by the above progress and in particular [6, 19], we deal with other features of the system
considered in [6]. Such system is composed of different regions submitted to two magnetic fields and
confined to a constant potential. This allows us to treat each region separately by determining the
corresponding energy spectrum solutions. We underline some physical properties of their spectrum
by taking into account of the energy conservation where interesting relations are obtained. Using
the continuity at different points, we explicitly evaluate the reflexion and transmission coefficients.
Combining all, we chow that the probability condition is well verified. As second task, we consider the
present system with energy gap t′ and do the same job to derive its eigenspinors as well as eigenvalues.

It is shown that even the reflexion and transmission coefficients take new forms in terms of gap but
the probability condition still verified. Interesting limits are discussed, which concern total reflexion
and transmission of the system with gap.

Finally, we treat the Klein paradox by using the current-carrying states where different limits
and discussions are presented. More precisely, we evaluate the currents for each region and use their
relations to the reflexion and transmission coefficients to check the probabilities. Subsequently, three
different cases are considered, which correspond to week, intermediate and strong potentials. We
notice that two last cases are shown negative transmissions. However, by combining all coefficients we
end up with a sum equal unity.

The present paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we consider a confined Dirac fermion in
inhomogeneous magnetic field (1). After getting the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we analyze the
energy conservation that allows us to derive interesting relations between involved quantum numbers
and parameters. In section 3, we study scattering between two regions to determine the reflexion and
transmission coefficients, which will be used to discuss the probability conditions of the present system.
We do the same job in section 4 but by considering three regions where the first is equivalent to the
third. The continuity at each point leads to express the coefficients entering in the game in terms of
different parameters. In section 5, we introduce a gap like a mass term and analyze the tunneling
effect of such case. We study the Klein paradox in section 6 by involving the currents corresponding
to different regions and consider three cases. Finally, we close by concluding our work.

2 Dirac fermions in inhomogeneous magnetic field

We consider a system of massless Dirac fermions through a strip of graphene characterized by the
length d and width W in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field. More precisely, we introduce
two magnetic fields B and B′, such as

B,
B′,
B,

x < −d
x < d
x > d.

(1)

B(x) =


According to the configuration (1), we decompose the present system into three regions. Schematically,
we end up with Figure 1

Figure 1: Magnetic field profile.

Clearly, regions I and III are similar but different with respect to region II. Note that, the system
characterized by Figure 1 has been analyzed in [6] for possible quantum wires in graphene. However,
in the present work we study other features of such system to deal with different issues, which concern
tunneling effect and Klein paradox.

2.1 Dirac Hamiltonian

Before writing down the appropriate Hamiltonian of the system (Figure 1), let us derive the corre-
sponding gauge field to the configuration (1). Indeed, using the continuity of the potential to obtain

Aj(x) =


AI(x) = Bx + (B − B′)d,
AII(x) = B′x,
AIII(x) = Bx − (B − B′)d,

x < −d
x < d
x > d.

(2)

where j is labeling regions I, II and III . It clear that, for B = B′ we end up with one potential and
therefore three regions become similar to each others.

In the systems made of graphene, the two Fermi points, each with a two-fold band degeneracy, can
be described by a low-energy continuum approximation with a four-component envelope wavefunction
whose components are labeled by a Fermi-point pseudospin = ±1 and a sublattice forming an hon-
eycomb. Specifically, the Hamiltonian for one-pseudospin component for the present system can be
written as

where the components of the conjugate momentum ~πj = ~p + e
c

~Aj are given by

Hj = υF ~σ · ~πj + Vj(x)

πx,j = px,

πy,j = py +

e
c

Aj(x)

(3)

(4)

and Vj(x) is the potential barrier that has a rectangular shape, which is infinite along the y-axis and
has the form

Vj(x) =( V0,

0,

−d < x < d
otherwise

where V0 > 0. Injecting all in (3) to get

Hj = υF  

Vj(x)/υF
px + ipy + i e

c Aj(x)

px − ipy − i e

At this stage, it is convenient to introduce the annihilation and creation operators. They can be

defined as

which is encoding all regions. This will be used to study each region separately and derive the
corresponding energy spectrum solutions.

2.2 Energy spectrum solutions

We determine the eigenvalues and eigenspinors of the Hamiltonian Hj. Indeed, the the Dirac Hamil-
tonian describing region I is obtained from (9) as

HI = ivF   0 −aI

0 ! .

a†I

The operators aI and a†I can be rescaled to define others, such as

which verify

Using these to write HI as

bI =

lB√2

aI,

b†I =

lB√2

a†I

[bI, b†I ] = I.

HI = iωc  0 −bI

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

where we have set ωc = √2 vF

lB

as a cyclotron frequency.

To get the energy spectrum solutions of (13), we solve the eigenvalue equation for a given spinor

φI =  ϕ1

ϕ2 ! of HI. This is

which is equivalent to

HI  ϕ1

ϕ2 ! = EI  ϕ1
ϕ2 !

iωc  0 −bI

0 !  ϕ1

ϕ2 !
ϕ2 ! = EI  ϕ1

b†I

and leads to two relations between spinor components

− iωcbIϕ2 = EIϕ1
iωcb†I ϕ1 = EIϕ2.

Now inserting (16) into (17) to obtain a differential equation of second order for ϕ2

2ω2

c b†I bIϕ2 = E2

I ϕ2.

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

It is clear that ϕ2 is an eigenstate of the number operator n = b†I bI and therefore we identify ϕ2 to the
eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator  ni, namely

and its eigenvalues read as

ϕ2 ∼ ni

EI,n = sωcpn

(19)

(20)

where n is obviously the eigenvalues of n, with n = 0,±1,±2,···, and s = sgn(n). Note that, n = 0
corresponds to the lowest Landau level, i.e. zero mode energy.

Using (16), (19) and (20) to get the first component as

which gives the eigenspinors

ϕ1 = −iωc
EI

bI  ni = −is  n − 1i

φI,n ∼  −si  n − 1i

 ni

! .

(21)

(22)

In terms of the parabolic cylinder functions Dn(x + x01) [20], the eigenspinors in the plane (x, y) are

φI,n,ky(x, y) =

1

√2  −siDn−1(x + x01)
Dn(x + x01)

! eikyy

where x01 = kyl2

B +(cid:16)1 − B′B (cid:17) d and Dn(x) are related to Hermite polynomials via

Dn(x) =(cid:0)lB√πn!2n(cid:1)− 1

2 exp(cid:18)−

x2

2 (cid:19) Hn(x).

As far as region II is concerned, we use the mapping n −→ m and s −→ s′ in (23) to obtain the

eigenspinors φII,m,ky (x, y) in terms of x02 = qyl2

and the corresponding eigenvalues

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

Finally, for region III the eigenvalues and the eigenspinors are similar to those of region I except

is the cyclotron frequency associated to the magnetic field B′.

where s′ = sgn(m) and ω′c = √2 vF

lB′

that the correspondence

B′

EII,m = s′ω′cpm + V0

x01 −→ x03 = kyl2

B −(cid:18)1 − B′
B (cid:19) d

must be taken into account in (23). Note that, for B′ = −B (with B′ < 0) the eigenspinors for three
regions can be expressed with the same position x0 = kyl2
B.

To give some illustrations, we focus on the eigenfunctions of four lowest states in region II, which are
summarized in Table 1. Different plots are given in Figure 2 those show that the mth eigenfunction
has m-nodes, namely there are m-values of x for which φII,m(x) = 0.

On the other hand, the wavefunctions have observable properties. Indeed, if the position coordinate

= 1.

eB′

is changed from x to -x, the eigenfunction has a definite symmetry

( φII,m(−x) = +φII,m(x),
φII,m(−x) = −φII,m(x),

if m is even
if m is odd

(27)

which is nothing but the parity symmetry. Furthermore, the position probability density of fermion
is given by

φm(x, y)2 = φm(x)2.

(28)

By plotting this for some specific values of m, we deduce an interesting conclusion. From Figure 3,
we notice that the fermion can have any location between x = −∞ and x = +∞, in marked contrast
with a classical fermion, which is confined to the region −A < x < +A where A is the amplitude of
oscillation.

2.4 Energy conservation

In the interface between regions, there is conservation of the tangent components of the wave vector,
i.e. ky = qy, and conservation of the energy. This is

which leads to the constraint

EI = EII = E

n
m

= B′
B

E2

(E − V0)2 .

(29)

(30)

Since n and m are integer values, the r.h.s term must be a fractional number, which can be written as

n = K m,

K ∈ Q+.

(31)

This relation is very important because without such set one can not talk about tunneling effect in
the present case. We will clarify this statement from next section and exactly when we begin by
calculating different quantities in order to check the probability condition.

Now let us return to (20) and (25) to write the ratio as

E
V0

=

pn
sqB′B m
pn − s′

.

(32)

Recall that in the region II we have V0 > 0, which implies that the energy E can be either positive or
negative. Therefore, we should distinguish between two situations as listed below

E > 0 (s = s′ = +1) E < 0 (s = s′ = −1)
n > B′B m

n < B′B m

Table 2: Positive and negative energies and their corresponding quantum number configurations.

These energies can be plotted to explicitly illustrate their behavior in terms of different quantities
entering in the game, which are given in Figure 4.

3 Two regions in inhomogeneous magnetic field

To treat a concrete example of the present system, we consider a barrier submitted to an inhomoge-
neous magnetic field. This barrier can be seen as superposition of two regions separated by an interface
localized at a fixed point. We study the tunneling effect by evaluating the reflexion and transmission
coefficients at interface, which in our case corresponds to the point zero. These will be used to show
that the probability condition is exactly one and emphasis what makes difference with respect to
without confinement case [19]. To do this task, we follow the same lines as has been done [19] and
distinguish between propagation with positive and negative incidences. In both cases we deal with
propagation from region I to II, II to III and vice verse.

3.1 Propagation with positive incidence

To proceed, let us first define the eigenspinors for three regions in positive and negative direction of
the variable x. In region I, we write

φI,+ =

1

√2  −siDn−1(x + x01)
Dn(x + x01)

! eikyy,

φI,− =

1

√2  −siDn−1(−x − x01)
Dn(−x − x01)

! eikyy.

(33)

Similarly, in region II we have

φII,+ =

1

√2  −s′iDm−1(x + x02)
Dm(x + x02)

! eikyy,

φII,− =

1

√2  −s′iDm−1(−x − x02)
Dm(−x − x02)

! eikyy

(34)

as well as in region III

φIII,+ =

1

√2  −siDn−1(x + x03)
Dn(x + x03)

! eikyy,

φIII,− =

1

√2  −siDn−1(−x − x03)
Dn(−x − x03)

! eikyy

(35)

where (±) refer to the positive and negative propagations, respectively.

We start by analyzing the case of propagation from region I to region II. Indeed, at the interface

x = 0 (for all y), the continuity of the system gives

φI,+ + r+

nmφI,− = t+

nmφII,+

8

(36)

nm and t+

where r+
From (33) and (34), we obtain

nm are reflexion and transmission coefficients, respectively, in positive propagation.

  −siDn−1(x01)
Dn(x01)

! + r+

nm  −siDn−1(−x01)
Dn(−x01)

! = t+

nm  −s′iDm−1(x02)
Dm(x02)

! .

(37)

They can be solved to get the coefficients in terms of some constants, which are magnetic field depen-
dent. They are

r+

nm(x01, x02) = (−1)n sAI − s′BI

sAI + s′BI

t+
nm(x01, x02) =

2sCI

sAI + s′BI

where we have set

AI = Anm(x01, x02) = Dn−1(x01)Dm(x02),
BI = Bnm(x01, x02) = Dm−1(x02)Dn(x01)
CI = Cn(x01) = Dn−1(x01)Dn(x01).

(38)

(39)

On the other hand, considering propagation from region II to region I, the continuity at point zero

reads as

which implies

φII,+ + r+

mnφII,− = t+

mnφI,+

  s′iDm−1(x02)

Dm(x02) ! + r+

mn  s′Dm−1(−x02)

Dm(−x02) ! = t+

mn  sDn−1(x01)
Dn(x01) ! .

These lead to the solution

r+

mn(x01, x02) = (−1)m s′BI − sAI

sAI + s′BI+

t+
mn(x01, x02) =

where FI is

2s′FI

sAI + s′BI

FI = Fm(x02) = Dm−1(x02)Dm(x02).

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

In similar way, we show that the reflexion and transmission coefficients corresponding to propaga-

tion from II to III are given by

r+

mn(x02, x03) = (−1)m s′BII − sAII

sAII + s′BII

t+
mn(x02, x03) =

where the constants read as

2s′FI

sAII + s′BII

AII = Anm(x02, x03),

BII = Bnm(x02, x03).

9

As far as the propagation from III to II is concerned, we find

r+

nm(x02, x03) = (−1)m sAII − s′BII

sAII + s′BII

where CII is

t+
nm(x02, x03) =

2sCII

sAII + s′BII

CII = Cn(x03).

(48)

(49)

(50)

This summarizes our analysis for propagation with positive incidence, which together will be used to
discuss different issues and before doing so, we need to analyze negative incidence.

3.2 Propagation with negative incidence

We determine the reflection and transmission coefficients for the propagation with negative incidence,
which will be denoted as r−nm/mn and t−nm/mn for the cases of the propagations from I to II, II to III and
vice verse. To reply this inquiry, we use the same analysis as before but one should take into account
the negative sign of variable.

In doing our task, for region I we write the corresponding eigenspinors as

φI,+ =

1

√2  −siDn−1(−x − x01)
Dn(−x − x01)

! eikyy,

φI,− =

1

√2  −siDn−1(x + x01)
Dn(x + x01)

! eikyy.

(51)

For region II, we have

φII,+ =

1

√2  −s′iDm−1(−x − x02)
Dm(−x − x02)

! eikyy,

φII,− =

1

√2  −s′iDm−1(x + x02)
Dm(x + x02)

! eikyy.

(52)

In region III, we write

φIII,+ =

1

√2  −siDn−1(−x − x03)
Dn(−x − x03)

! eikyy,

φIII,− =

1

√2  −siDn−1(x + x03)
Dn(x + x03)

! eikyy.

(53)

Now let us treat each case to evaluate reflexion and transmission coefficients. Considering the

propagation: I −→ II to obtain

at point zero. Injecting (51) and (52) into (54), one gets

φI,+ + r−nmφI,− = t−nmφII,+

r−nm(x01, x02) = (−1)n sAI − s′BI
t−nm(x01, x02) = (−1)n+m

sAI + s′BI

sAI + s′BI

For II −→ I a similar relation to (54) reads as

φII,+ + r−mnφII,− = t−mnφI,+.

t−mn(x01, x02) = (−1)n+m

sAI + s′BI
2s′FI

sAI + s′BI

.

After applying the same technique as before, we show that the propagation: II −→ III gives

r−mn(x02, x03) = (−1)m s′BII − sAII
t−mn(x02, x03) = (−1)n+m

sAII + s′BII

and III −→ II leads

By inspecting the forms of different coefficients obtained so far, one can establish a symmetry

between them. Indeed, We show the relation

t∓ij(x01, x02)

r±ij(x01, x02)
r±ji(x01, x02)

= (−1)n+m

(64)

where the pair of index is chosen such as (i 6= j) ∈ {n, m}. Note that, the same relations are also valid
for the couple (x02, x03).

3.3 Reflexion and transmission amplitudes

Now let us collect the products of our results by checking their importance. In fact, we discuss the
reflexion and transmission amplitudes between regions to emphasis the influence of each parameter
on them. For propagation between I and II, we define the reflexion and transmission amplitudes as

ρ(x01, x02) = r±ij(x01, x02)r∓ij (x01, x02),

τ (x01, x02) = t±ij(x01, x02)t±ji(x01, x02).

(65)

After replacing, we end up with

ρ(x01, x02) =

τ (x01, x02) =

[sAI − s′BI]2
[sAI + s′BI]2
4ss′CIFI
[sAI + s′BI]2 =

4ss′AIBI

[sAI + s′BI]2

(66)

(67)

where the relation CIFI = AIBI is satisfied. A straightforward calculation shows that the probability
sums to unity, namely

ρ(x01, x02) + τ (x01, x02) = 1.

(68)

To stress how the amplitudes behave in terms of different parameters, we give Figure 5. It is clear
that, ρ(x01, x02) and τ (x01, x02) change with respect to variation the magnetic field B′ for different
values of B, m, d and ky.

11

Figure 5: Reflexion ρ(x01, x02) (red line) and transmission τ (x01, x02) (green line) coefficients between
region I and II for a magnetic barrier of width 2d at various magnetic field B′ for two cases: a) B = 10,
b) B = 15 and for different values of (m, d, ky).

It worthwhile to invert the situation by varying B for two values of B′ a given configuration of the
parameters (m, d, ky). This summarized as follows

12

Figure 6: Reflexion ρ(x01, x02) (red line) and transmission τ (x01, x02) (green line) coefficients between
region I and II for a magnetic barrier of width 2d at various magnetic field B for two cases: a) B′ = 10,
b) B′ = 15 and for different values of (m, d, ky).

As far as the propagation between II and III is concerned, we use the same definition as above to

write the amplitudes

ρ(x02, x03) = r±ij (x02, x03)r∓ij (x02, x03),

τ (x02, x03) = t±ij(x02, x03)t±ji(x02, x03)

(69)

which give

ρ(x02, x03) =

τ (x02, x03) =

[sAII − s′BII]2
[sAII + s′BII]2
[sAII + s′BII]2 =

4ss′CIIFI

4ss′AIIBII

[sAII + s′BII]2

where CIIFI = AIIBII. Using these to verify

ρ(x02, x03) + τ (x02, x03) = 1.

As before we illustrate this result by making different plots, which are given by Figure 7

(70)

Figure 7: Reflexion ρ(x02, x03) (red line) and transmission τ (x02, x03) (green line) coefficients between

B = 10, b) B = 15 and for different values of (m, d, ky).

B′ = 10, b) B′ = 15 and for different values of (m, d, ky).

These are among the interesting results derived so far. In fact, it tell us the transmission of barrier
in inhomogeneous magnetic fields can not be greater than one, which is analogue to what obtained in
one field case and without confinement [19].

Let us present some discussions and derive interesting results those have applications in physics
areas. Indeed, similar relations to what obtained above exist also for the photon optics cases. For
instance, one can write (68) and (72) when a light beam is reflected and refracted in a diopter between
regions I-II and II-III. The first case is characterized by the configuration

• For n = 0

=⇒

( ρ(x01, x02) = 1,

ρ(x02, x03) = 1,

τ (x01, x02) = 0
τ (x02, x03) = 0.

This is an expected result since the transmission τ = 1− ρ must be zero in the case where the wave in
the n-region enters in the m-region and vice verse. In fact, the interface between tree regions behaves
like a mirror where the reflexion is total. The second case is described by

• For s = s′ and n = ±m

=⇒

( ρ(x01, x02) = 0,

ρ(x02, x03) = 0,

τ (x01, x02) = 1
τ (x02, x03) = 1

which means that the interface between region I-II and II-III behaves like a non-reflective diopter,
namely there is a total transmission. Note that, these two cases have interesting interpretation in
optics physics.

4 Tree regions in inhomogeneous magnetic fields

We study another case of a physical system composed of a region indexed by the quantum number m
of length 2w separating two others indexed by the same quantum number n. This will allow us to see
how the above results will be changed to the present case and underline what make difference with
respect to the former analysis.

4.1 Reflexion and transmission coefficients

The present situation is quiet different from the former one. We use the above tool to write the
continuity equation at the points x = −d and x = d. Then, we derive the quantities needed to discuss
the reflexion and transmission coefficients as well as the corresponding probabilities. This will be done
by treating propagation with positive and negative incidences.

We study the positive incidence by considering the geometry that corresponds to the first interface,

which is

15

Figure 9: Magnetic field profile between regions I and II.

Using the above spinors to setup the continuity equation at the point x = −d. Doing this process to
get the relation

φI,+(−d) + r+φI,−(−d) = αφII,+(−d) + βφII,−(−d)

(73)

where r+ is the reflection coefficient for positive incidence, which will be determined together with the
parameters α and β. (73) gives

sDn−1(d1) + r+sDn−1(−d1) = αs′Dm−1(d2) + βs′Dm−1(−d2)
Dn(d1) + r+Dn(−d1) = αDm(d2) + βDm(−d2)

with the constants d1 = x01 − d and d2 = x02 − d. These can be solved for α and β to obtain

α =

sAnm(d1, d2) + s′Bnm(d1, d2) + r+(−1)n [s′Bnm(d1, d2) − sAnm(d1, d2)]

To accomplish such analysis we consider the second interface as shown below

Figure 10: Magnetic field profile between region II and III≡I.

At the point x = d, we have

αφII,+(d) + βφII,−(d) = t+φIII,+(d)

(80)

where t+ is transmission coefficient for positive incidence. After replacing, we end up with a system
of equations, such as

αs′Dm−1(d′2) + βs′Dm−1(−d′2) = t+sDn−1(d3)
αDm(d′2) + βDm(−d′2) = t+Dn(d3)

(81)

with d′2 = d + x02 and d3 = d + x03. The solution reads as

obtain

(88)

Having obtained the above results, we analyze the corresponding probability and give comments. This
issue and related matter will be considered in the forthcoming subsection.

4.2 Probability

To characterize the behavior of the present system, we study the incident beam. This can be achieved
by calculating the probability of reflexing and transmitting beam. Indeed, let us adopt the definition

After calculation, we find

R = r+r−,

T = t+t−.

R =

T =

ρ(d1, d2) + ρ(d′2, d3) − 2r−n,m(d1, d2)r−n,m(d′2, d3)

1 + ρ(d1, d2)ρ(d′2, d3) − ρ(d1, d2) − ρ(d′2, d3)

.

17

(89)

(90)

(91)

Combining all to end up with probability

R + T = 1.

(92)

From this, we summarize the following conclusions:

• The probabilities of reflection and transmission sum to unity, as must be the case, since they

are the only possible outcomes for a fermion incident on the barrier.

• (90) and (91) yield that under resonance conditions:

n = m,

s = s′

the barrier becomes transparent, i.e. T = 1.

• More significantly, however, the barrier remains always perfectly transparent for n = m.
• T = 1 is the feature unique to massless Dirac fermions.
• T = 1 is directly related to the Klein paradox in quantum electrodynamics.

Introducing gap

In the present study, we consider the confined system in inhomogeneous magnetic field given by the
configuration (1) but in the presence of an energy gap t′ in the region II. We will show how the above
results will be generalized to the gap case.

5.1 Hamiltonian formalism

As far as regions I and III are concerned, the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions are those given before
for case of without t′. However, in region II the Dirac Hamiltonian can be written as

HII = H B′

qy = υF ~σ~π + V0 + t′σz.

(93)

Clearly, the mass term t′σz makes difference with respect to the former analysis. In fact, it will play
a crucial role and lead to discover interesting results. In terms of matrix, HII takes the form

HII = υF

px − ipy − i e

! +  V0 + t′

V0 − t′ ! .

(94)

For next purpose, we determine the energy spectrum solutions of (94).

In doing so, let us fix

φII =  ϕ′1

ϕ′2 ! as a spinor of HII in presence of an energy gap t′, such as

which implies two relations

HII  ϕ′1

ϕ′2 ! = EII  ϕ′1

Figure 12: Energy Em for a magnetic barrier of width 2d: a) Em as function of B′ and t′, b) Em as
function of B′ and V0.
We notice that in the presence of energy gap, there is a gap separating the conduction and valence
bands, which is missing in the case where t′ = 0 (Figure 12b).

To complete the derivation of eigenspinors, we determine the first component ϕ′1. Then, from (96)

and (97) we obtain

ϕ′1(x, y) = −iω′cpm
EII − V0 − t′

bm =s EII − V0 − s′t′

(102)

(103)

As concerning regions I and III, the corresponding eigenspinors φI,n,ky(x, y, x01) and φIII,n,ky(x, y, x03)

can be written in compact form as φI,n,ky(x, y, x0) where

x0 = kyl2

B −(cid:18)1 − B′

B (cid:19) x

such that x = −d and x = d give x0 = x01 and x0 = x03, respectively.

On the other hand, the energy conservation between regions I and II gives

EI = EII = E.

However, in region II there two cases:

5.2 Reflexion and transmission coefficients in the presence of t′

We will see how the results obtained before can be generalized to the present case. To proceed,
we consider two (barrier) and three regions (diode). For barrier, we show that the reflexion and
transmission coefficients are

ρ′(x0, x02) =

τ′(x0, x02) =

=

[sbmAI − amBI]2
[sbmAI + amBI]2 .
4sbmamCIFI

[sbmAI + amBI]2

[sbmAI + amBI]2

20

(110)

(111)

Clearly, what makes difference with respect to the former results is the appearance of the constant
parameters am and bm. These coefficients can be used to verify the probability condition

ρ′(x0, x02) + τ′(x0, x02) = 1.

(112)

Figure 13: Reflexion ρ′(x0, x02) (red line) and transmission τ′(x0, x02) (green line) coefficients for a
magnetic barrier of width 2d at various energy E for two cases: a) V0 = 15, t′ = 5 and b) V0 = 30,
t′ = 10.

At (V0 = 15, t′ = 5) and (V0 = 30, t′ = 10) the transmission and reflexion profile (Figure 13) between
regions I − II and II − III show

• −t′ < E < t′: τ′(x0, x02) → 1 and ρ′(x0, x02) → 0
• t′ < E < V0 − t′: τ′(x0, x02) decreases and ρ′(x0, x02) increases.
• V0 − t′ < E < V0 + t′: there is no transmission and non reflexion (not allowed states).
• E > V0 + t′: τ′(x0, x02) → 1 and ρ′(x0, x02) → 0.
As far as three regions are concerned, one can inspire from the case without gap to obtain the

reflection and transmission amplitudes, such as

R' =

T' =

ρ′(d1, d2) + ρ′(d3, d′2) − 2r+
n,m(d3, d′2)
1 + ρ′(d1, d2)ρ′(d3, d′2) − 2r+
n,m(d3, d′2)
1 + ρ′(d1, d2)ρ′(d′2, d3) − ρ′(d1, d2) − ρ′(d′2, d3)
1 + ρ′(d1, d2)ρ′(d′2, d3) − 2r+
n,m(d′2, d3)

n,m(d1, d2)r+
n,m(d1, d2)r+

n,m(d1, d2)r+

After a straightforward calculation, we find

R'+ T'=1.

Note that, for B = B′ we discover the results obtained in [19], which shows that our results are more
generals.

6 Klein Paradox

We complete the present work by analyzing the Klein paradox for the present system. This can
be done by introduce other considerations based on the current-carrying states and study different
limiting cases.

6.1 Propagation from region I to region II: (x = −d)
We consider the scattering of a Dirac fermion of energy E from an electrostatic step-function potential
as shown in Figure 14. This problem is an archetype problem in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.
For relativistic quantum mechanics, we will find that the solution leads to a paradox (Klein paradox)
when the potential is strong.

Figure 14: Electrostatic potential idealized with a sharp boundary, with an incident free scalar fermion
of energy moving to the right in region I.

According to the previous analysis for two regions, it is easy to note that the solution of the Dirac

equation in the region I and II are given by

φx<−d =

φx>−d =

√2  −siDn−1(x + x01)

Dn(−x − x01)

(116)

(117)

where R and T are reflected and transmitted coefficients, respectively. Imposing the boundary condi-
tion that φ be continuous at (x = −d) gives the relation

  sDn−1(−d + x01)

Dn(−d + x01) ! + R  sDn−1(d − x01)

Dn(d − x01) ! = T   amDm−1(−d + x02)
bmDm(−d + x02) ! .

Solving for R and T to obtain

where we use the notation

R =

T =

sbmu1v3 − amv1u3
amv2u3 − sbmu2v3
s(u1v2 − v1u2)
amv2u3 − sbmu2v3

u1 = Dn−1(−d + x01),
v1 = Dn(−d + x01),

u2 = Dn−1(d − x01),

u3 = Dm−1(−d + x02)

v2 = Dn(d − x01),

v3 = Dm(−d + x02).

22

(118)

(119)

(120)

(121)

To proceed further, we introduce the current-carrying states. This is based on the current associ-

ated to Dirac equation, which is

where i = x, y. As an immediate application, the incident current is given by

φ+σiφ

J = evXi

I σxφI + φ+

JI = ev(cid:0)φ+

I σyφI(cid:1) = sevu1v1.

This can be used to evaluate the final currents to the left and right of the potential boundary, which
read as

Recall that, the reflexion and transmission amplitudes are related to the currents through

R =

T =

After replacing, we end up with

R =

T =

u3v3 [i(a+

m)] (u1v2 − v1u2)2

.

These show that the probability is

R + T = 1.

We can inspect (126) further to derive other results. This can be achieved by considering three
interesting cases.

6.2 Limiting cases

In region II there are three distinct cases, depending on the strength of the potential. This is shown
by Figure 15:

23

Figure 15: Energy level diagram for a fermion in region II.

Let us analyze each case separately and underline its physical properties.

Indeed, in the weak
potential that corresponds to E−V0 > t′, we have a restriction on the quantum numbers and parameter
constants, such as

In such case, the reflexion and transmission amplitudes are given by

m = +m,

a†m = am,

b†m = bm.

They verify the probability condition (130). Thus the incident beam is partly reflected and partly
transmitted. This is similar to the result obtained in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The last
expression shows that the total probability is conserved.

As far as the intermediate potential is concerned, i.e. E − V0 < t′, different quantities reduce as

where the probabilities sum to unity, as must be the case, since reflection and transmission are the

The probability is still conserved, but only at the cost of a negative transmission amplitude and a
reflection amplitude which exceeds unity. The strong potential appears to give rise to a paradox.
There is no paradox if we consider that in the strong potential case the potential is strong enough to
create particle-antiparticle pairs. The antiparticles are attracted by the potential and create a negative
charged current moving to the right. This is the origin of the negative transmission amplitude, i.e.
(136). The particles, on the other hand, are reflected from the barrier and combined with the incident
particle beam (which is completely reflected) leading to a positively charged current, moving to the
left and with magnitude greater than that of the incident beam.

7 Conclusion

We considered a system composed of different regions of Dirac fermions in the presence of an inhomoge-
neous magnetic field and confining potential V (x) in one-direction. The energy spectrum solutions are
obtained in terms of different parameters and quantum numbers for each regions. To underline some
physical properties of the obtained solutions, we analyzed the energy conservation. This allowed us
to establish interesting relations and therefore solve some issues related to reflexion and transmission
of the system.

More precisely, by considering our system as as barrier, we derived interesting results. In fact,
using the continuity equation at different points we explicitly determined the reflexion and transmis-
sion coefficients. These are used to define the corresponding amplitudes and therefore to show that
their probabilities sum to unity. Different cases are treated, which concerned total reflecting and
transmitting beams where they are interpreted as mirror or diopter systems.

Subsequently, we focussed on three regions of two fixed points d and −d. Writing the continuity
at each point, we derived different quantities those are needed to characterize the beam of the present
system. Indeed, we reached the conclusions that the probabilities of reflection and transmission sum
to unity, as must be the case, since they are the only possible outcomes for a fermion incident on the
barrier. Furthermore, (90) and (91) yielded that under resonance conditions: n = m and s = s′,
the barrier becomes transparent, i.e. T = 1. More significantly, however, the barrier remains always
perfectly transparent for n = m. This latter is the feature unique to massless Dirac fermions and
directly related to the Klein paradox in quantum electrodynamics.

Another interesting cases is analyzed, which concerned introducing a gap. After getting the energy
spectrum solutions, we discussed different issues and among them the energy conservation. This
allowed us to generalize the former analysis to gap case. As interesting results, we showed that the
probabilities of reflecting and transmitting amplitudes sun to unity as well. Requiring that B = B′,
we recovered the result obtained in [19].

Finally, we discussed the Klein paradox by involving the current-carrying states for different re-
gions. Using their relations to the reflexion and transmission amplitudes, we checked the probability
by evaluating different quantities. Moreover, we treated three different limiting cases, which concern
week, intermediate and strong potentials. For two last cases, the transmission amplitude is obtained
with a negative sign, however when it is added to the reflexion coefficient gives a sum equal unit.
