We present a thorough analysis of the electron density distribution (shape) of two electrons,
confined in the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, as a function of the perpendicular
magnetic field. Explicit algebraic expressions are derived in terms of the system's parameters and
the magnetic field strength to trace the shape transformations in the ground and low-lying excited
states. We found that the interplay of the classical and quantum properties lead to a quantum shape
transition from a lateral to a vertical localization of electrons in low-lying excited states at relatively
strong Coulomb interaction with alteration of the magnetic field. In contrast, in that regime in the
ground states the electrons form always a ring type distribution in the lateral plane. The analytical
results demonstrate a good agreement with quantum numerical results near the transition point and
at high magnetic field.

INTRODUCTION

Shape transitions in quantum systems belong to sym-
metry breaking phenomenon which is specific to finite
systems [1], when, under varying external or internal pa-
rameters, a finite system exhibits a change of shape. This
change can be spontaneous: the system acquires the cho-
sen form because it is energetically profitable.
In this
connection, due to finite number of particles, quantum
fluctuations play essential role. They transform phase
transitions observed in bulk systems to crossover from
one type of symmetry to another one, and/or from one
shape to another. In the latter case, although a partial
symmetry may be preserved, the change of the density
distribution can affect the physical properties of a finite
quantum system.

Nowadays, technological achievements in nanotechnol-
ogy have opened wide opportunities for studying in de-
tail such crossovers in mesoscopic systems, which prop-
erties are defined by the interplay between microscopic
(quantum) and macroscopic (classical) constituents. A
semiconductor quantum dot (QD), where a few electrons
are confined electrostatically to a nanometer sized region,
provide a convenient correlation range ground to study
this interplay.

Long ago Wigner predicted that electrons interact-
ing by means of Coulomb forces could create a crystal-
lized structure in a three-dimensional (3D) space at low
enough densities and temperatures [2]. At these condi-
tions the potential energy dominates over the kinetic en-
ergy and defines equilibrium configurations of electronic
systems. Such crystallization in QDs is expected to re-
sult in the formation of the so-called Wigner molecule in
a two-dimensional (2D) case [3 -- 5]. Generally, electrons
in the Wigner molecule should localize in space, i.e., they
occupy fixed sites in a rotating frame [6]. Within a 2D
approach, a criterion for the onset of the Wigner crys-
tallization in QDs could be the appearance of a local

electron density minimum at the center of a dot [7]. For
a circular QD, created in a thin semiconductor layer, this
leads to a radial modulation in the electron density, re-
sulting in the formation of rings (see, e.g., [8, 9]).

Another driving force for the Wigner crystallization in
a QD could be induced by a strong magnetic field [10].
The presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field
in QDs with a non-negligible thickness, however, may
change nontrivially the electron density distribution. In
our preliminary studies [11, 12] we have shown that, when
the field strength exceeds a specific value, the preferable
positions of electrons in a two-electron QD are at the op-
posite sides of its center along the vertical direction (i.e.,
perpendicularly to the layer plane), see Fig. 1. Namely,
by increasing the magnetic field, the strength of the effec-
tive lateral confinement of electrons increases, too; that
leads to a lateral squeezing of the QD. At a sufficiently
strong field the lateral size of the QD (at the lowest
states) becomes smaller than its vertical size (thickness),
and electrons choose the vertical arrangement as a more
stable, due to the Coulomb repulsion,. Thus, at a spe-
cific field strength the QD experiences a shape transition
such that the electron density distribution changes from
a ring or disk type (depending on whether the Wigner
molecule is formed or not) to a vertical type. Taking
into account the existence of these transitions, a general
criterion for the formation of a 3D Wigner molecule in a
two-electron QD may be a dislocation (radial or vertical)
of the electron density maximum from the dot center.

To study the combined role of a two-body interaction
and the external magnetic field, related to shape tran-
sitions, we shall concentrate on the simplest nontrivial
case, on two identical particles (electrons) in a 3D axially
symmetric harmonic oscillator potential. The purpose of
the present paper is to provide a thorough analysis of
the interplay between classical and quantum-mechanical
properties in order to get deep insight into a spontaneous
symmetry breaking phenomenon under strong Coulomb

interaction and/or strong magnetic field. Although there
are numerous results on two-electron QDs in a magnetic
field (for a review see [1, 5, 13]), up to now there is no
a consistent analysis of shape transitions in this system,
which includes a detailed investigation of classical and
quantum-mechanical features. Accurate numerical re-
sults will be complemented by analytical results in order
to provide a physical insight in details of numerical calcu-
lations. Note, that the analytical results could establish
a theoretical framework for accurate analysis of confined
many-electron systems, where the exact treatment of a
3D case becomes computationally intractable.

II. PRELIMINARIES

Two-electron quantum dots provide reliable experi-
mental data (see, e.g., [14 -- 16]) as well as a prospective
theoretical platform to study various aspects of quan-
tum correlations (see, e.g., [17 -- 19] and references therein)
with a high accuracy. For small QDs with a few electrons
an effective trapping potential is quite well approximated
by a parabolic confinement (see discussion in [1]). Note,
if a 2D harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb potential
are combined like in a QD, most of symmetries are ex-
pected to be broken (see, e.g., [20, 21]). In case of the
axially symmetric 3D quantum dot we have a noninte-
grable motion, in general, too. However, it was shown
that the transition from chaotic to regular dynamics and
vice versa can be controlled with aid of the magnetic field
[22, 23]. This result has been investigated thoroughly one
decade later [24], and also rederived by using Killing ten-
sors (see discussion in [25]).

a semiconductor, respectively. For the magnetic field we

ton. The confining potential is approximated by a 2D
circular harmonic oscillator in xy-plane and the vertical

ω0 and ωz are the energy scales of the confinement in
the xy-plane (lateral confinement) and in the z-direction
(vertical confinement), respectively. In the present anal-
ysis we neglect the spin interaction, since the correspond-
ing energy is small compared to the confinement and the
Coulomb energies. Herewith, we consider only a vertical
parabolic confinement Vz, while different forms for the
vertical confinement (e.g, [26]) may be analysed as well.

numbers M and m are good quantum numbers.

The separability of the Hamiltonian (1) allows us
to write its eigenenergies (QD's energy levels) as sums
E = ECM +Erel, and the corresponding eigenfunctions in
the form of products Ψ(r1, r2) = ψCM(R) ψ(r12). Corre-
spondingly, ECM and ψCM(R) are the eigenenergies and
the eigenfunctions of HCM, while Erel and ψ(r12) are the
eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions of Hrel. Since the
Coulomb interaction enters only into the relative mo-
tion term, the components of CM motion are decoupled.
The CM problem is analytically solvable, which gives the
eigenenergies of HCM in the form
ECM = Ω(N + 2M + 1) + ωz(Nz + 1/2) − ωLM, (4)

where N, Nz = 0, 1, 2, . . . are, in addition to M , good
quantum numbers. The corresponding eigenfunctions
ψCM(R) are products of the Fock-Darwin states [27] and
oscillator functions in z-direction. On the other hand, the
relative motion is not fully separable due to the Coulomb
coupling (except the specific frequency ratios ωz/Ω [23]).
The corresponding eigenenergies and eigenstates can be
determined numerically or using approximate methods
(see Sec. V). They are characterized by a certain parity
(even/odd) and by the good quantum number m-value.
We will see, however, that for low-lying states it is pos-
sible to introduce two vibrational quantum numbers (re-
lated to the radial and the vertical modes), which provide
a full classification.

Below we provide a detailed analysis of the effective
potential (6) and study its dependence on the magnetic
field strength. Assuming that at low-lying states of a two-
electron QD the maxima of probability density ψ(r12)2
are located approximately at the positions of minima of

Veff , the analysis of this potential can be useful in the
study of localization of electrons in the QD and formation
of the Wigner molecule. In Sec.IV we will show that this
assumption is well justified, indeed.

III. ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVE

POTENTIAL

A. Stationary points

The positions of minima and all stationary points of
the effective potential (6) are determined from the condi-
tions ∂Veff /∂ρ12 = 0, ∂Veff /∂z12 = 0. The real solutions
of this system of equations are: (i) (ρ12, z12) = (ρa, 0),
where ρa is the positive root of equation
a − κ ρa − m2 = 0,

Ω2ρ4

(7)

which in the case m = 0 is ρa = (κ/ Ω2)1/3 (otherwise see
Appendix A); and (ii) (ρ12, z12) = (ρb,±zb), where

Obviously, for m = 0 we have ρb = 0 and zb = rb, whereas
for m (cid:54)= 0 the real solutions exist if Ω > ωz ∧ rb ≥ ρb.
Therefore, the effective potential (6) has always a station-
ary point located at ρ12-axis (solution (i), see Figs. 2(a,b)
and 3(a,b)). Two additional points, located out of this
axis (solution (ii), see the same figures), exist: if m = 0;
and for m (cid:54)= 0 if Ω is larger than the value

following from the condition rb ≥ ρb.

Depending on the parameters Ω, ωz, κ, as well as
on the value of quantum number m, these station-
ary points are minima or saddle points. Their type
is determined from the values of the second deriva-
tives of the effective potential. From the condition
12(ρ12=ρa, z12=0) = 0 and Eq. (7) it follows
∂2Veff /∂z2
that the stationary point (i) changes the character at
Ω = Ωbif . At the other values of Ω the sign of the sec-
ond derivative indicates that the stationary point (i) is
the minimum if Ω < Ωbif ; while it is the saddle point if
Ω > Ωbif . Contrary, the stationary points (ii) are min-
ima if Ω > Ωbif , and they are saddle points if Ω < Ωbif
If m (cid:54)= 0 these points do not exist at
and m = 0.
Ω < Ωbif , because this inequality is equivalent to the
condition rb < ρb.

Different types of stationary points on the surface are
connected by a valley whose bottom defines the so-called
minimum energy path (MEP) [28] (blue line in Figs. 2

FIG. 3: (Color online) Similar to Fig. 2, for m > 0. The nor-
mal coordinates (q1, q2), describing small oscillations around
the minimum (ρb, zb) in the case Ω > Ωbif , are obtained by ro-
tating the local cylindrical coordinates (∆ρ, ∆z) on the angle

The bifurcation can be visualized by plotting the val-
ues of the potential (6) along the MEP for different val-
ues of the parameter Ω. However, since the MEP varies
by changing Ω in a complicate manner, instead of the
cut along this path, we plot the cut of the potential (6)
along a semi-elliptic contour, that connects the station-
ary points. This contour can be expressed in the form

ρ12 = a sin χ,

tionary points of the effective potential (minima and saddle
points) are marked by green and red dots, respectively. The
blue lines represent the minimum energy paths, that connect
the unstable and stable stationary points.

In physical chemistry, such a path on the po-

tential energy surface of a molecular system is usually
called the reaction coordinate. The MEP has the prop-
erty that any point on the path is at an energy minimum
in all directions perpendicular to the path [29]. As a con-
sequence, the resulting force acting on the system at a
point of the MEP is required to act along the path. This
is evident in Figs. 2(c,d) and 3(c,d), showing the vector
diagrams of the force field −(cid:126)∇12Veff .

B. Bifurcation of the potential minimum

a = ρa,

b =

.

(12)

As it is mentioned in Sec. II, the magnetic field can be
used to vary the effective lateral confinement frequency of
a given QD. For typical QDs with ω0 < ωz at zero mag-
netic field (i.e., Ω = ω0) it is Ω < ωz, and thus Ω < Ωbif .
Therefore, for B = 0 the stationary point (i) is the min-
imum of the effective potential (6) (see Figs. 2(a), 3(a)).
With the increase of the magnetic field over the value Bbif
(which corresponds to Ω = Ωbif ) this stationary point
transforms to the saddle point, and two new minima (sta-
tionary points (ii)) appear, divided by a potential barrier
(see Figs. 2(b), 3(b)). Since the change of a type of the
stationary point (i) takes place simultaneously with the
appearance of new minima, one observes the bifurcation

Note that the contour (11) and the MEP almost coincide
when m = 0 and Ω > Ωbif (see Fig. 2(b)). In other cases
they are different, but the cut of the potential (6) along
the contour (11) still represents efficiently the behaviour
of the potential around stationary points. (It should be
mentioned that for Ω < Ωbif and m > 0 the solution

and zb → rb, which give b = rb as in the case m = 0.)
The cuts of the potential (6) with ωz = 2.5 and κ = 15
for m = 0 and m = 2 as functions of Ω are shown in
Fig. 4. The dependence of stationary point positions (χ
coordinate) on Ω yields a typical bifurcation diagram.

L (0) = (ω2

z − 1)1/2 ≡ ωsph

Particularly, for m = 0 Eq. (10) gives Ωbif = ωz
and ωbif
L . In our earlier stud-
ies [22, 23] it has been shown that at ωL = ωsph
the
magnetic field gives rise to the effective spherical sym-
metry (ωz/Ω = 1) in the axially symmetric QD. Thus,
for m = 0 the bifurcation of stationary point (i) occurs
when the potential (6) becomes spherically symmetric.
The value ωbif
L (dashed line in Fig. 5) does not
depend on the Coulomb interaction strength but only
on the ratio ωz = ωz/ω0. The corresponding value of
the magnetic field Bsph, however, depends on ω0, too
(B ∼ ωL = ω0 ωL). For m (cid:54)= 0 the bifurcation occurs at
L , which depends on κ and on m (see Fig. 5).
L > ωsph

The later dependence can be explained by the influence
of the centrifugal term m2/2ρ2

(6).

minimum at Ω < Ωbif .

As we have already seen, when Ω < Ωbif the effective
potential (6) has a minimum at (ρa, 0) (see Figs. 2(a)
and 3(a)). In the vicinity of this minimum the potential
can be approximated by the expansion in terms of ∆ρ =
ρ12 − ρa and ∆z = z12, in a similar way as it was done

in Refs. [10, 30] for the 2D case. Keeping all terms up to

In the general case (i.e., for arbitrary m) the motions

Since for m = 0 the variables ∆ρ and ∆z are decou-

q1 = ∆ρ and q2 = ∆z. Note, however, that when m = 0
the rotations on θ = π/2 and θ = π (then c = 0 and
c = −1, respectively) also provide the separability (see
Appendix B).

Note that formula (28), when m = 0, does not give the
correct solution (one obtains c = 0 instead of c = 1). This
is a consequence of the fact that the cases with m (cid:54)= 0
cannot be continuously connected to the case m = 0.
Thus, limm→0 c( Ω, m) (cid:54)= c( Ω, 0). Anyway, for m = 0 we

formula (27) reduces to Eq. (23). Then, at the bifurcation

When Ω > Ωbif , the effective potential Veff (ρ12, z12)
has the minima at (ρb,±zb), see Fig. 3(b). In this case, it
is convenient to expand this potential into a series around
the point (ρb, zb) (or (ρb,−zb)).

Thus, for m = 0 and m (cid:54)= 0, the frequency ω1b tends
to zero at Ω → Ωbif + 0. We recall that it corresponds
to the oscillatory mode along the MEP (blue line) in do-
main Ω > Ωbif . At the end of Sec. III C we found that
the frequency ω2a (which corresponds to the same mode
when Ω → Ωbif − 0) also tends to zero. Therefore, we
conclude that when the normal frequency along the MEP
tends to zero, the bifurcation of the potential minimum
takes place: a symmetry breaking occurs. In our case this
is an indication that the shape transition in the QD takes
place. In fact, similar phenomenon have been discussed
in context of fast rotating nuclei around a symmetry axis
in [31, 32]. This analogy becomes evident once one com-
pares the Hamiltonian of QDs in a perpendicular mag-
netic field and a cranking Hamiltonian used in nuclear
structure physics (see, e.g., [33]).
In an isolated small
QD, the external magnetic field acts like rotation of a
nucleus (see discussion in [1, 13]).

We recall that in this section only the classical proper-
ties of the effective potential have been analysed. On the
other hand, the effective potential can be considered as
the effective mean field of our quantum system. The next
step is to establish the connection between the classical
and quantum properties of the QD.

IV. LOCALIZATION OF ELECTRONS IN THE

QD

The analysis of the effective potential Veff ( Sec. III) is
done under the assumption that maxima of the probabil-
ity density ψ(r12)2 of low-lying eigenstates, associated
with the relative motion Hamiltonian Hrel, are located
approximately at the positions of minima of this poten-
tial.
In order to clear up this point we calculate nu-
merically the electron density distribution in the QD. It
depends on the relative motion and the CM motion parts
of the total wave function. The relative location of elec-
trons in the QD under the crystallization regime (Wigner
molecule) is determined by the quantity ψ(r12)2. In the
laboratory frame this arrangement is partially shaded by
the CM motion. Therefore, we analyze the probability
density for the relative position of electrons and the total
electron density. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (5)
are determined by diagonalizing this Hamiltonian in the
oscillator basis. We recall that it consists of the prod-
ucts of Fock-Darwin states, corresponding to lateral de-
grees of freedom (ρ12, ϕ12), and oscillator functions in
z12-direction (see Appendix C). The details of calcula-
tion of the electron densities are given in Appendix D.

For the sake of comparison, on the top of Figs. 6, 7,
we display the equipotential surfaces of the effective po-

FIG. 6:

ωz/ω0 = 2.5, κ = 1.5 and m = 0 (top), the probability density

the lowest state with m = M = 0 at three values of the mag-
netic field strength: (a,d,g) B = 0 (ωL = 0, ωz/Ω = 2.5);
(b,e,h) B = Bsph (ωL = ωsph

tential Veff . We start the quantum analysis of the elec-
tron localization in the ground state at zero magnetic
field (m = M = 0). Figs. 6(d),(g), display the distri-
butions ψ(r12)2 and n(r), respectively, at ωz/ω0 = 2.5,
κ = 1.5 (RW = 2.12132) in the ground state at B = 0.
This value of κ (and RW ) corresponds to the GaAs QD
with ω0 ≈ 2.8 meV, which is a typical lateral confine-
ment strength for QDs created in semiconductor layers.
One observes that, although ψ(r12)2 has a minimum at
ρ12 = z12 = 0, the electron density n(r) has the maxi-
mum at ρ = z = 0. In other words, with given parame-
ters of the QD, the criterion for the onset of the Wigner
crystallization (see Introduction) is not fulfilled. By in-
creasing the magnetic field strength B from zero to values
B > Bsph, the ratio ωz/Ω decreases from ωz/ω0 to val-
ues ωz/Ω < 1. As a result, the distributions ψ(r12)2 and
n(r) change the form. In the example shown in Fig. 6,
however, the electron density n(r) has the maximum at
ρ = z = 0 at all field strengths, i.e., there is no a crystal-
lization. The reason for this absence is a too small value
of the Wigner parameter RW .

We found that in a circular two-electron QD with
the parabolic confinement in the 2D approximation (i.e.,
when ωz/ω0 → ∞) the criterion for the crystallization is
fulfilled at RW ≥ 12.8. For QDs with a finite thickness

vided by the potential barrier. Consequently, the proba-
bility density is distributed symmetrically in the z12 < 0
and z12 > 0 half-planes at the positions of these min-
ima (see Figs.6(c),(f); 7(c),(f)). Therefore, for low-lying
states a splitting of the probability density maximum oc-
curs simultaneously with the bifurcation of the stationary
point (i) of the effective potential.

We recall that the so-called singlet-triplet transitions
take place (see below Sec. V C) with the increase of the
magnetic field strength. The ground state, which is ini-
tially characterized by m = M = 0, at higher field
strengths is characterized by different non-zero values of
m (keeping M = 0). To trace the localization of elec-
trons in the ground states at B > 0, we have to con-
sider also the lowest states with m > 0. We found that,
similar to the m = 0 case, the maxima of ψ(r12)2 for
m (cid:54)= 0 are located at the positions of the effective poten-
tial minima. On the other hand, the electron density n(r)
maxima are allocated on the ring around the dot center
(associated with the formation of the Wigner molecule)
at B < Bbif (m); and it is of the vertical type distribution
at B > Bbif (m).

In general, in an axially symmetric QD, for the lowest
state with m > 0 at the field strength B the correspond-
ing electron density distribution changes the shape when
the magnetic field exceeds the value Bbif (m). We will
show below that in such a QD the shape transitions can
not take place in the ground states, in principle.

V. ENERGY SPECTRA

As we pointed out in Sec. II, the QD energy levels
can be written as sums E = ECM + Erel. Here ECM
are the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian HCM, given by
Eq. (4), and Erel are the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian
Hrel that can be determined either numerically or using
an approximate method. Since the Coulomb interaction
does not affect the CM motion, manifestations of the
strength of this interaction are expected in the energy
spectrum of the Hamiltonian Hrel. Below we analyze the
magnetic field dependence of the energy levels Erel at
typical (small) and large values of the strength parameter
κ.

Numerical values for the eigenenergies of the Hamil-
tonian Hrel are calculated by diagonalizing this Hamil-
tonian in the oscillator basis. Details of the method are
given in Appendix C. Alternatively, low-lying energy lev-
els for the relative motion can be calculated by means of
analytical expressions discussed below.

A. Approximate calculations of low-lying energy

levels: Classification of states.

As we have seen in Sec. III, when ωL < ωbif

L (m),
the minimum of the effective potential (6) is located at
(ρ12, z12) = (ρa, 0) (see Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)), and the

FIG. 7: (Color online) Similar to Fig.6 for κ = 15.

the critical value for RW is additionally shifted upward.
For example, at the ratio ωz/ω0 = 2.5 and zero magnetic
field, the critical value is approximately 14. The GaAs
QD with this value of RW has the lateral confinement
strength ω0 ≈ 0.065 meV. Below we consider an exam-
ple where RW is sufficiently large for the formation of
Wigner molecule at B = 0.

Fig. 7 displays the results discussed above for κ = 1.5,
at κ = 15 (RW = 21.2132). For any value of B the max-
ima of ψ(r12)2 are located at the positions of minima of
the effective potential as in a typical QD. For large RW
the electrons are more separated, and these maxima are
more prominent. As a consequence, the maxima of elec-
tron density n(r) are now dislocated from the center of
the QD. If B < Bsph, we have a typical Wigner molecule
of a ring type. For B > Bsph the electron density has two
maxima in the vertical direction, located symmetrically
from the opposite sides of the center (vertical type). (The
full 3D shapes can be obtained by rotating plots (g)-(i)
in Fig. 7 around z-axis.) The shape transition of the
Wigner molecule occurs at B ≈ Bsph ≡ Bbif (0).

Thus, our assumption on the correspondence between
the classical potential minima and the probability density
ψ(r12)2 maxima of the low-lying eigenstates are con-
firmed, indeed, by direct comparisons of the correspond-
ing plots (see the top and middle rows of Figs. 6, 7). For
B < Bbif the stationary point (i) of the potential, which
is located at (ρa, 0), is the minimum (see Sec. III), while
the probability density ψ(r12)2 has there a maximum
(see Figs.6(a),(d); 7(a),(d)). For B > Bbif , however,
there are two minima of the potential at (ρb,±zb), di-

blue full lines represent numerically calculated levels that correspond to even and odd states, respectively; the dotted lines
represent the approximate levels, obtained with the aid of Eqs. (33) and (34). The vertical dashed lines mark ωbif

(here ωbif

L = 2.2913 and ωbif

expansion around this point is given by Eq. (13). The
low-lying eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian Hrel (in ω0
units) are determined approximately by formula

Erel = Va + ω1a(nρ + 1

2 ) + ω2a(nz + 1

2 ) − ωLm,

(33)

where Va, ω1a and ω2a are given by Eqs. (14), (15) and
(16), respectively.
When ωL > ωbif
L , the effective potential Veff (ρ, z) has
the minima at (ρb,±zb) (see Figs. 2(b) and 3(b)), and
we expand the potential around one of them. With the
aid of the results obtained in Sec.III D, we determine the
low-lying eigenenergies of Hrel (in ω0 units) by the ap-
proximative formula

Erel = Vb + ω1b(n1 + 1

2 ) + ω2b(n2 + 1

2 ) − ωLm,

(34)

where Vb, ω1b and ω2b are given by Eqs. (19), (29) and
(30), respectively.
Therefore, the low-lying energy levels can be classi-
fied by the set of quantum numbers {N, Nz, M, n, nz, m},
L ; and by the set {N, Nz, M, n1, n2, m},
when ωL < ωbif
when ωL > ωbif
L . Here N , Nz, M and m are good quan-
tum numbers, and n, nz, n1 and n2 are approximate
quantum numbers.

B. Manifestations of shape transitions in the

energy spectrum

Fig. 8 demonstrates a good agreement between the
numerical and analytical results obtained by means of
Eq. (33) for B (cid:28) Bbif (m) at the small value of κ. The
spectra exhibit typical features, as (anti)crossings of en-
ergy levels at the field strengths when the system be-

comes integrable [23]. For small values of κ (∼ 1), how-
ever, there is no any indication in the spectra on shape
transitions.

The situation is different for large values of the
strength κ. Fig. 9 displays the same levels as shown in
Fig. 8, with ωz = 2.5 and much stronger strength κ = 15.
For the magnetic field strengths, i.e., ωL < ωbif
L (m) the
spectra have similar structure at small and at large values
of κ. However, by increasing ωL over ωbif
L (m) and more,
if κ is sufficiently large, the pairs of nearby levels with dif-
ferent parities (even/odd) start converging each to other,
forming doubly degenerate levels. A similar effect oc-
curs if, at the fixed magnetic field strength such that
ωL > ωbif

L (m), the parameter κ increases (see Fig. 10).

These effects can be explained by the reflection symme-
try of the effective potential with respect to line z12 = 0
(ρ12-axis) and by the existence of the potential barrier
(ridge) along this line, when ωL > ωbif
L (m). In QDs with
small κ (∼ 1) the barrier width, as well as its height
at the saddle point (Va − Vb), are small. As a result,
the motions around two minima at (ρb,±zb) are coupled,
either over the barrier or by tunnelling through the bar-
rier (see Fig. 11(a)). A consequence of this coupling is
the splitting of the energy levels, corresponding to even
and odd states with the same values of quantum numbers
(n1, n2, m). Contrary, for large κ ((cid:29) 1) and a sufficiently
large ωL (> ωbif
L (m)) the barrier is large enough to sepa-
rate almost exactly the motions in vicinities of the min-
ima (see Fig. 11(b)). It results in the double degeneracy
of lowest levels.

Turning back to Fig. 9, one observes that at large
values of κ the energies, obtained with the aid of the
approximate expressions (33) and (34), are in a good
agreement with the numerical results if our system is

Another manifestation of the shape transitions in the
QDs with large values of κ is the change of slope of
the lowest energy levels Erel(B) with small values of m,
particularly for m = 0, around the values Bbif (m) (see
Figs. 9 and 12(b)). The explanation for this effect lies
in the change of the form of the wave function ψ(r12)
around the bifurcation points.

levels (with m = 0) on the parameter κ at ωz/ω0 = 2.5 and

far from the shape transition, i.e., when B (cid:28) Bbif (m)
or B (cid:29) Bbif (m). In the later case this agreement is a
consequence of the fact that the motions around minima
(ρb,±zb) are efficiently decoupled, that was not the case
at small values of κ. Since Eq. (34) is derived by con-
sidering small oscillations around one of the minima, i.e.,
by neglecting any coupling, it is clear that this formula
agree well with numerical results only in the domain of
double degeneracy.
The formation of doubly degenerate levels occurs for
any value of the quantum number m. For m (cid:54)= 0, how-
ever, this effect takes place at larger values of the Lar-
mor frequency ωL in comparison to the one for m = 0
(see Fig. 9(b)). Evidently, the increase of the Larmor
frequency yields the increase of values m. It results in

We conclude, the double degeneracy and the change of
slope of the lowest energy levels are indications of the re-
distributon of the electron density in the vertical direction
of the QD with well separated electrons. From the corre-
lation diagram given in Fig. 10, showing the lowest levels
with m = 0 at the magnetic field larger than Bbif (0), it
follows that doubly degenerate levels appear if κ ≥ 10.

C. Singlet-triplet transitions versus shape

transitions

Fig. 12 displays the lowest energy levels Erel with dif-
ferent values of m at: (a) ωz = 2.5 and κ = 1.5; (b)
ωz = 2.5 and κ = 15, as functions of the magnetic field.
From the point of view of the roto-vibrational model
(Secs. III C, III D and V A) this part of spectrum shows
the rotational levels around the lowest vibrational level
(nρ = nz = 0 when B < Bbif , and n1 = n2 = 0 when
B > Bbif ). At zero magnetic field the lowest vibrational
state with m = 0 is the ground state (we assume here
that the CM quantum numbers are N = Nz = M = 0).
However, with the increase of the magnetic field strength
the states with m (cid:54)= 0 become the ground states at dif-
ferent intervals of the field strength (see e.g. Fig. 12(a)).
This effect leads to the well-known spin oscillations or
singlet-triplet (ST) transitions in the ground state [34 -- 
37].

state. The solid dots show the positions of bifurcation points for different values of m (particularly Bbif (0) ≡ Bsph). The

m crosses the lowest level with another value of this quan-
tum number. We assume that these levels represent the
ground state energies at B < BST(m) and B > BST(m),
respectively. Fig. 12 demonstrates that for small and
large values of the strength κ

for all m. For example, when m = 0 the bifurcation
point is at B = Bsph, but in the interval (0, Bsph) there
are several ST transitions, and the ground state of the
QD with ωz = 2.5 at B = Bsph is the lowest vibrational
state with m = 2 if κ = 1.5, or with m = 13 if κ =

15. We have verified the generality of the rule (35) and
found that for the QDs with ωz > ω0 it is always fulfilled,
with the exception of near spherical cases [12]. Thus, we
can conclude that: (i) the shape transitions of axially
symmetric two-electron QDs do not occur at the ground
state and takes place only in the excited states; (ii) if
the Wigner molecule is formed in the ground state it is
always of the ring type. Of course, the vertical type of the
Wigner molecule can be formed in the lowest vibrational
states with different values of quantum number m (see
Sec. IV), but at field strengths B > Bbif (m) when they
are not the ground state.

To illuminate shape transitions in axially symmetric
two-electron QDs found in [11, 12], we perform a thor-
ough analysis of the effective potential, created by the ex-
ternal parabolic potential, the Coulomb interaction and
the external magnetic field. The classical analysis enables
to us to identify all stationary points of the considered
potential and their properties (at fixed different values
of the magnetic field). The electron localization is ex-
plained by the existence of the minimum in the effective
potential at weak magnetic fields, and the shape tran-
sition is a consequence of the bifurcation. At a specific
value Bbif of the magnetic field, the bifurcation splits the
potential minimum in two minima, separated vertically
by the potential barrier.

To elucidate the quantum features of the shape trans-
formation we calculate the electron density with the aid
of the wave function. It is shown that with the increase
of the magnetic field strength, the density distribution
changes from the ring type in the plane to the two verti-
cal maxima, located symmetrically around z12 = 0. We
have determined the values of the magnetic field that
trigger this shape transition at corresponding magnetic
quantum numbers m for excited states, and found that
these values are related to Bbif (m) values.

As a matter of fact, for m = 0, the shape transition
takes place at the excited state, when the effective lateral
and the vertical confinement strengths are equal, i.e., at
the onset of the effective spherical symmetry. Although
the third component of the angular momentum is con-
served in the both shapes, the electron density distribu-
tion is different. This fact is also reflected in the variation
of the cuts of the effective potential (see Fig.4), which re-
semble in appearance a quantum phase transition of the
second order in many-body systems (see textbook [38]).
It is noteworthy that the entanglement of two-electron
QD states (a genuine quantum property) is strongly af-
fected by the shape transition. In our analysis [11, 12] we
have found that the entanglement decreases by increasing
the magnetic field till the bifurcation point, reaching its
minimum, and then rising again. In the considered case
of the shape ("phase") transition we speculate that the
order parameter might be associated with a moment of
inertia, or with the magnetic susceptibility of the QD.
The optical response might be another source on the
shape transitions. However, this subject is beyond the
scope of the present paper and deserves itself a separate
study.

In the considered system the shape transition yields a
family of doubly degenerate levels with different parities
and for different values of the magnetic quantum num-
bers m in the energy spectrum. This transition mani-
fests itself also as the change of the slope of the lowest
energy levels with small values m with the increase of
the interaction strength. Consequently, it seems that the
appearance of the doubly degenerate levels at some mag-
netic field strength could indicate the shape transition

12

from the lateral distribution to the well separated elec-
trons in the vertical direction (depending also on the the
thickness of QDs). If one turns to the ground state prop-
erties and shape transitions, we found that there is no
any shape transition in the ground states of the axially
symmetric two-electron QDs. The Wigner molecule (if it
will occur eventually) will form a distribution of the ring
type in the lateral interface for any strength of the mag-
netic field. In contrast, the shape transition occurs to the
vertical density distribution only in the excited states of
the QD (see Fig. 12).

Since for B < Bbif (m) and for B > Bbif (m) the effec-
tive potential has minima (which are different in these
two domains), we have used the small oscillation approx-
imation in the both cases. With the aid of the trans-
formation to the rotating frame, we determine normal
coordinates and normal frequencies. By means of these
frequencies we derive the analytical results for quantum
eigenenergies that remarkably well reproduce the results
of quantum-mechanical numerical calculations at strong
magnetic field strengths, independently on the strength
of the Coulomb interaction κ. We have demonstrated
that when one of the normal frequencies tends to zero
the bifurcation of the potential minimum occurs, which
yields the shape transition. Since this phenomenon takes
place in different quantum systems (e.g., [31, 32]), we sug-
gest to use this criterium to identify shape transitions in
finite quantum systems.

In a two-electron QD with the parabolic confine-
ment, the CM and the relative motions are separated
(see Sec. II). Consequently, the wave function reads
Ψ(r1, r2) = ψCM(R) ψ(r12). Using this separation and
replacement r(cid:48) → r(cid:48) + r (under which the integral in
(D2) is invariant), Eq. (D2) transforms to the form

ψCM(r + r(cid:48)/2)2(cid:2)ψ(−r(cid:48))2 + ψ(r(cid:48))2(cid:3) dr(cid:48).
