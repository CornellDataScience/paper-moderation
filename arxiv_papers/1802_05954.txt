We study the non-equilibrium evolution of concurrence of a Bell pair constituted of two qubits,
through the measurement of Loschmidt echo (LE) under the scope of generalized central spin model.
The qubits are locally coupled to a one dimensional disordered Ising spin chain. We first show that in
equilibrium situation the derivative of LE is able to detect the extent of Griffiths phase that appeared
in presence of disordered transverse field only. While in the non-equilibrium situation, the spin chain
requires a temporal window to realize the effect of disorder. We show that within this timescale,
LE falls off exponentially and this decay is maximally controlled by the initial states and coupling
strength. Our detail investigation suggests that there actually exist three types of exponential decay,
a Gaussian decay in ultra short time scale followed by two exponential decay in the intermediate
time with two different decay exponents. The effect of the disorder starts appearing in the late time
power law fall of LE where the power law exponent is strongly dependent on disorder strength and
the final state but almost independent of initial states and coupling strength. This feature allows
us to indicate the presence of Griffiths phase. To be precise, continuously varying critical exponent
and wide distribution of relaxation time imprint their effect in LE in the late time limit where the
power law fall is absent for quenching to a Griffiths phase. Here, LE vanishes following the fast
exponential fall.
Interestingly, for off-critical quenching LE attains a higher saturation value for
increasing disorder strength, otherwise vanishes for a clean spin chain, referring to the fact that
disorder prohibits the rapid decay of entanglement in long time limit. Moreover, we show that
disorder is also able to destroy the light cone like nature of post quench quasi-particles as LE does
not sense the singular time scales appearing for clean spin chain with qubits coupled at symmetric
positions.

INTRODUCTION

In recent year, there has been an upsurge of studies in
various quantum information theoretic measures such as
fidelity [1], decoherence [2, 3], concurrence [4, 5], quan-
tum discord [6] and entanglement entropy [7] connect-
ing the quantum information science [8 -- 14], statistical
physics and condensed matter physics [15 -- 18] in a con-
crete way. In particular, the effect of quantum critical-
ity appears in the ground-state correlation that becomes
maximum at the quantum critical point (QCP); for ex-
ample, the concurrence, a separability based approach to
measure the quantum correlation, can detect as well as
characterize a QCP. Furthermore, considering a central
spin model, a single qubit globally coupled to an environ-
mental spin chain that exhibits a quantum phase transi-
tion, a plethora of the studies is devoted to investigate
the decoherence of the qubit by probing the Loschmidt
echo (LE) [2, 19, 20]; LE is defined as the square of over-
lap of the two wave functions evolved with two different
Hamiltonians while initially both the states are prepared
in the ground state of the one of the Hamiltonians. It has
been experimentally demonstrated using NMR quantum

simulator that the LE shows a dip at the QCP of a finite
antiferromagnetic Ising spin chain, hence it suffices as an
ideal detector of a QCP [21].

Motivated by the seminal work on random transverse
field Ising model [22] and random Heisenberg antifer-
romagnetic chains [23] using the strong-disorder renor-
malization group technique, the disordered spin systems
have grabbed an enormous attention due to its non-trivial
modifications on the phase diagram obtained in the clean
disorder free case [24 -- 26]; in the later works, the critical
behavior is investigated using a mapping to random-mass
Dirac equations.
Interestingly, randomness might lead
to Griffiths phases and new universality classes [27]. It is
noteworthy that the emergence of Griffiths phase is inves-
tigated using the finite size scaling of fidelity susceptibil-
ity and its distribution probability [28]. Similarly, in the
context of entanglement entropy, it has been shown for
the disordered spin chain that an effective central charge
dictates its behavior [29, 30]. The critical properties of
long range disordered transverse Ising model [31] and as-
sociated many body localization transitions [32] are also
extensively studied in equilibrium.

Simultaneously, slow quenching dynamics of many
body quantum systems [33] and the quantum informa-
tion theoretic measures [34] emerge as interdisciplinary
fields of research [35]. One of the other ways of generat-
ing such a non-equilibrium dynamics is a sudden quench
[18]. The sudden quench dynamics of entanglement en-

tropy is investigated for disordered quantum spin chains
[36]. Recently, entanglement entropy in the context of
many body localization transition is examined using dis-
ordered Ising chain following this quench [37]. In paral-
lel, the relaxation dynamics and thermalization after a
quantum quench in disordered chain has also captured
attention [38]. Focusing on our work, the model consid-
ered here is referred as the generalized central spin model
(GCSM) where two qubits are locally coupled to the en-
vironmental spin chain. It noteworthy that the sudden
quench is also employed in the environmental clean spin
chain to study the generation of concurrence [13] and
decay of concurrence [39] between a pair of qubits con-
sidering GCSM.

Given the recent studies on disentanglement of a pair of
qubits coupled to clean environment, our main aim here
is to investigate the effect of disorder in the environmen-
tal chain on the non-equilibrium evolution of concurrence
which is directly estimated from LE. The temporal char-
acterization of LE and subsequently, concurrence for a
GCSM with disordered transverse Ising chain to the best
of our knowledge is completely new. In the process, by
computing the derivative of LE we first exemplify a situ-
ation where randomness present only in transverse field
leads to a Griffiths phase. Secondly, The signature of
Griffiths phase is also imprinted in the temporal evolu-
tion of LE; long time power law decay of LE is absent
for quenching inside Griffiths phase. Although, a short
time rapid exponential fall is observed for all types of
quenching schemes. Moreover, our study suggests that
disorder helps in preserving entanglement between two
initially entangled qubits. Furthermore, we find that the
ultra-short time Gaussian fall of LE remains unaltered
even in the presence disorder. Our investigation suggests
that equilibrium characteristics and non-equilibrium dy-
namics of LE might serve as useful indicator for detecting
Griffiths phase. Finally, we show that the quasi-particles
generated after the quench do not propagate in the light
cone like manner after a threshold disorder strength.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we in-
troduce the CGCM consisting of two qubits locally con-
nected to two sites of an Ising chain in presence of dis-
ordered transverse field. We define the concurrence. It
is derived from the 4 × 4 reduced density matrix of the
two qubits obtained by tracing out the environmental
degrees of freedom; In Sec. III, we illustrate our results
for weak as well as strong coupling case and analyze the
ultra-short, short and long time behavior of concurrence
specifically, LE. Finally, we provide our concluding re-
marks in Sec. IV.

II. MODEL

We consider GCSM, comprised of two qubits (system)
and an environmental spin chain, to study the entan-
glement dynamics between these two qubits when the
environment is suddenly quenched. The qubits are non-

2

interacting and they are locally coupled with the envi-
ronment. The Hamiltonian of the total system (qubits +
environment) is given by

HT = HEN + HQ.

(1)

Here HEN is the Hamiltonian of the environment, in our
case which is a one dimensional chain of N Ising spins
in presence of random transverse field. The interaction
Hamiltonian between the qubits and the environment is
represented as HQ. This model is widely studied to mea-
sure decoherence and entanglement between qubits in the
qubit-bath set up[40].

The Hamiltonian of the environment is given by

HEN = −J

N

Xi=1

i+1 −

N

Xi=1

Γiσz

(2)

i , σz

where σx
i are the x and z components of Pauli spin
matrices respectively and Γi is the transverse field at the
i-th site. Such Γis are distributed following Gaussian

distribution P (Γi) = (1/√2πΩ2) exp(−(Γi − Γ)2/2Ω2),

where Γ is the mean and Ω is the standard deviation
of the distribution. The standard deviation Ω reveals
the strength of disorder in the values of transverse field.
Hereafter the average or mean value of the transverse
field will be simply referred as transverse field. The near-
est neighbor spin-spin interaction is denoted by J and we
consider periodic boundary condition.

Let us revisit the critical behavior of disordered Ising
chain quickly; one can consider Ji and Γi to be random
interaction and site dependent random coupling. The
spin chain becomes critical when the average value of
the field matches with the average value of the coupling.
It has been shown using the strong disorder renormal-
ization group that, at the QCP, the time scale t and
length scale N are related by loge(t) ∼ N 1/2. As a
result, dynamical exponent z at criticality acquires an
infinite value. Another interesting feature is the gener-
ation of Griffiths phase in the vicinity of the QCP; the
distribution of relaxation times becomes broadened due
to Griffiths singularities. The Griffiths phase is specif-
ically characterized by a dynamical exponent z which
depends on the distance (δG) from the QCP (δG = 0)
of the pure spin chain. The width of the Griffiths phase
i.e., δG has been analytically obtained using Dirac-type
equation with random mass in the continuum limit [25];
this also confirms the numerical finding obtained using
real space renormalization group decimation technique
[22]. We note that this Griffiths phase appears in the
disordered side of the phase diagram. We here consider
homogeneous interaction strength, Ji = J; this belongs
to another prototypical model for disordered quantum
spin chain which falls in the universality class of Ising
transitions for all values of Ji.

We consider the qubits are coupled at the sites 1 (qubit
A) and 1 + d (qubit B) of the environmental spin chain
given in (2). The interaction Hamiltonian of the qubits

HQ is given by

A,B such that σz

HQ = −∆(↑ih↑A ⊗ σz
(3)
Here ↑i is the eigenstate of σz
A,B↑i =
↑i. The coupling strength is denoted by ∆(> 0). σz
represents the environmental spin at site i.
The initial state of the qubits is a maximally entangled
Bell state: φiA,B = 1√2
(↑A↑Bi + ↓A↓Bi). The environ-
ment is assumed to be in its ground state Φ(ΓI )ig where
ΓI is the initial value of the transverse field. There-
fore, the initial state of the total system is ψ(0)i =
φA,Bi ⊗ Φ(ΓI )ig. At initial time t = 0+, we suddenly
quench the transverse field from ΓI to a final value ΓF .
Such quenching results in a non-equilibrium time evolu-
tion of the composite system by changing the instanta-
neous state of the environment. The time evolution of the
environment depends on the initial state of the qubits. If
the qubits are in the state ↓A↓Bi then the spin chain
will evolve with the Hamiltonian H(cid:21) = HEN (ΓF ). On
the other hand, if the qubits are in the state ↑A↑Bi then
the time evolution of the environment will be governed
by the Hamiltonian H⇈ = HEN (ΓF ) − ∆(σz
1+d).
The state of the total system at instant of time t can be
written as

1 + σz

[⇈i ⊗ Π⇈(t)iEN + (cid:21)i ⊗ Π(cid:21)(t)iEN ]. (4)
ψ(t)i =
where Πλ(t)iEN = e−iHλ(ΓF )tΦ(ΓI )ig with λ =⇈, (cid:21).
Here we omit A and B subscripts for simplicity.
In order to measure the decoherence of the qubits, we

compute LE L which is defined as

L⇈,(cid:21) = ghΦ(ΓI )eiH(cid:21)(ΓF )te−iH⇈(ΓF )tΦ(ΓI )ig

The dynamics of the LE is governed by the environmental
Hamiltonians H⇈ and H(cid:21).

Hamiltonian H (7) can be diagonalized by the unitary
matrix U given by

One can now write LE (5) in terms of covariant matri-

ces [39] Lλ(t) = ENhΠλ(t)Ψ Ψ†Πλ(t)iEN given by

L⇈,(cid:21) = det(I − L(cid:21)(t) − L⇈(t))1/2

(9)
The time evolution of L is written as Lλ(t) =
e−itHλL(0)eitHλ . Such covariant matrix at t = 0, can
be represented as

L(0) = (cid:18) hC†Ci hC†C†i

hCC†i (cid:19) = (cid:18) hT h hT g
gT h gT g (cid:19)

hCCi

(10)

Here h.i denotes the expectation value in the initial
ground state of the environment Φ(ΓI )ig. We note that
the method of computing LE is directly borrowed from
the Ref.[39] where the environment is considered to be
a clean spin chain. We give a derivation of the above
Eq. (9) in the Appendix.

Having computed the LE, now we can calculate the
concurrence between the qubits from the reduced den-
sity matrix for the qubits. This reduced density matrix
of the qubits can be constructed by tracing out the envi-
ronmental degrees of freedom from the composite density
matrix obtained from ψ(t)i given in Eq. (4). In the basis
{ ↑↑i, ↑↓i, ↓↑i, ↓↓i}, the reduced density matrix for
the two qubits system is given by

where d↑↑,↓↓ = ENhΠ↑↑(t)Π↓↓(t)iEN . The LE corre-
sponding to different channels is thus given by L↑↑,↓↓(t) =
d↑↑,↓↓(t)2 and its explicit form is written in Eq. (5).
Now, using the density matrix ρs(t) in Eq. (11), one
can calculate the concurrence between the two qubits.
The concurrence is given by

C(ρs) = max(0,√ǫ1 − √ǫ2 − √ǫ3 − √ǫ4),

(12)

where ǫi's are the eigenvalues in a descending order of
the non-Hermitian matrix M = ρs ρs with ρs defined as

ρs = (σy ⊗ σy)ρ∗s(σy ⊗ σy).

(13)

The eigenvalues are coming to be ǫ1(t) = 1/4(1 +
d↑↑,↓↓(t))2, ǫ2(t) = 1/4(1 − d↑↑,↓↓(t))2, ǫ3,4 = 0. One
can easily show that the concurrence becomes C(ρs) =
pL↑↑,↓↓(t) = d↑↑,↓↓(t). Therefore, the LE of the envi-

ronment coupled to the system is the main quantity of
interest which measures the entanglement between the
qubit during the time evolution. We shall focus only on
the LE in the subsequent result section.

of Loschmidt echo (LE) ∂ΓI L with the initial transverse field

For all the system sizes, ∂ΓI L shows a peak at ΓI ≈ 1.06
which reveals the existence of Griffith phase in the disordered
Ising chain. Here, we set time t = 10 and the final value
of transverse filed is ΓF = 1.50. (b) The peak height of the

.

true for non-equilibrium situation where derivative of LE
with respect to a parameter of the quantum Hamiltonian
shows a singular behavior at QCP [39]. The question
we ask here is that whether for a disordered chain the
derivative of LE still shows a peak around the QCP of
the clean chain. Our study suggests that first derivative
of L with respect to the transverse field shows a peak
around the boundary of the Griffiths phase that is cre-
ated in presence of disorder. The position of such peak
does not coincide with the peak appearing at the QCP
of the clean spin chain.

We numerically calculate the derivative of Loschmidt
echo (∂ΓI L) for different values of initial transverse field
ΓI by keeping final value of transverse field fixed at
ΓF = 1.5 and time is fixed at t = 10.
(see Fig.1a).
The values of coupling strength and coupling distance
are ∆ = 0.10 and d = 1 respectively. In our calculation,
we take disorder strength Ω = 0.30 and the disorder av-
erage is made over 500 configurations. The derivative of
LE shows peak at ΓI ≈ 1.06 which does not show any
tendency to shift towards clean critical point (ΓI = 1.00)
when the system size increases from N = 300 to N = 600.
This shift of the critical point indicates the existence
of the Griffith phase in the disordered Ising spin chain;
this phase arises due to the inhomogeneity of the trans-
verse field. The derivative shows a peak at the boundary
between the Griffiths phase and the disordered phase.
Therefore, our numerical study indicates that the Grif-
fiths phase is extended from the Γ = 1.0 to Γ = 1.06.
The analytical expression of the Griffiths phase for disor-
der present in both interaction and transverse field [41]
might not be applicable for our case as we are dealing
with randomness only in transverse field.
In our case,
we think that due to the disordered transverse field, the
competition between spin-spin interaction and quantum
fluctuation (i.e., local transverse field) are not identical
in the individual sites. As result of that there exist lo-
cal order in the spin chain and the thermodynamic ob-
servables essentially become non self-averaging. In this

4

way one would expect that Griffiths phase emerges in
presence of disorder transverse field. Moreover, we note
that if Γis are distributed with only two possible values
Γi = ±Γ, then one would not expect to see any Grif-
fiths phase. We also note that using fidelity susceptibil-
ity the boundary of Griffiths phase has also been probed
[28]. Similar to the clean system [39], here also the peak
height logarithmically increases with the system size i.e.,
∂ΓI LΓmax ∼ loge(N ) (see Fig.1b).

B. Quenching dynamics of the spin chain

We numerically study the quenching dynamics of con-
currence, determined by LE L, between two qubits a dis-
ordered transverse field Ising chain of length N = 100.
We note that in all the subsequent numerical calculation,
the disorder average is made over 500 configurations of
the environmental chain and the value of coupling dis-
tance is d = 1. The nature of the coupling is deter-
mined by comparing it with the bare energy gap of the
environment i.e., 2 set by the clean spin chain with peri-
odic boundary condition. We investigate the GCSM for
strong coupling strength ∆ > 2 as well as weak coupling
limit i.e., ∆ < 2 following ferromagnetic and paramag-
netic quenches in the environmental spin chain. Further-
more, we extend our study of non-equilibrium dynam-
ics of LE following a quench inside the Griffiths phase.
We analyze the dynamics for different values of disorder
strengths along with the clean limit Ω = 0.0. Our focus
is to extensively investigate the temporal decay of LE
under these different quenching schemes; we hence study
the ultra-short, short and long time domains in the non-
equilibrium evolution of LE.

First, we start by investigating the behavior of L when
the spin chain is quenched from ΓI = 10.0 to ΓF = 2.0
i.e., both the initial and the final values of transverse
fields belong to the paramagnetic phase. The time evo-
lution of L for different values of Ω are depicted in the
Fig. (2a) and Fig. (2b) with weak coupling strength
∆ = 0.1 and strong coupling strength ∆ = 10, respec-
tively. For lower values of coupling strength, we find two
different types of behaviors of L in two different time do-
mains (see Fig. (2a)). Initially echo for disordered chain
falls of more rapidly as compared to the clean chain; the
fall becomes more sharper as one increases the disorder
strengths. On the other hand, in the late time limit, echo
for the clean chain vanishes while for finite Ω it remains
non-zero; surprisingly, the long time value of L increases
with Ω. For strong coupling case, L decays more rapidly
for less disordered spin chain in both the early and late
time limit (see Fig. (2b)).

The initial fall is mainly determined by the difference in
the initial and final Hamiltonian. In the present set up of
GCSM, the weak coupling can only modify the transverse
field in two sites in addition to the global sudden quench.
Therefore, as one increases Ω from 0, H⇈ and H(cid:21) be-
come more deviated from each other. Hence, the overlap

FIG. 3. (Color online) The ultra short time evolution of Loschmidt echo L for different quenching schedules with coupling
strength ∆ = 0.10 are shown in (a). The initial value of the transverse field is ΓI = 0.70 and the final quenched values are
ΓF = 0.50, 070, 0.90, 1.10. The ultra short time dynamics of L for ∆ = 20.0 is shown in (b) with the same set of quenching
parameters as discussed in (a). In both the cases, the disorder strength is Ω = 0.10.

between the initial state i.e., eigenstate of H(cid:21) and the
time evolved state governed by Hamiltonian H⇈ rapidly
decays from unity. In contrary, during the course of late
time dynamics the instantaneous state evolves more close
to the initial state when Ω increases; the clean chain does
not lead to an instantaneous time evolved state that sig-
nificantly close to the initial state. We note that the
initial sharp fall is exponential while late time slow fall
obeys a power law. Therefore, the advantage of having
disorder in transverse field is that the qubits remain in
an entangled state even long after the sudden quench.
Moreover, the local details of the two Hamiltonians, gov-

erning the dynamics, are maximally determined by ∆ for
strong coupling case; this results in a similar kind of fall
characteristics for both early and late time limit. Disor-
der imprints less effects on LE for strong coupling case
compared to weak coupling case.

Upon inspecting the weak and strong coupling case
simultaneously, one can say that the characteristic na-
ture of decay of LE is different for them. Although, in
presence of disorder, one can see that after the initial
quick fall of L it decreases very slowly with time; this
feature is universal for weak as well as strong coupling
limit. Therefore, it is clearly evident after investigating

the time evolution of LE in complete time domain that
there is a crossover present in the temporal behavior.

Now, coming back to the strong coupling case where
the time evolution of LE again shows the early time rapid
fall and late time slow fall (see Fig. (2b)). The initial
decay rate of LE for early time is higher as compared to
weak coupling case. This is due to the fact that initial
and final Hamiltonian become more deviated for strong
coupling case. For clean system after the initial fall L
shows irregular oscillation which are suppressed in the
presence of disorder. The late time dynamics is mainly
governed by disorder strength as the decay nature of LE
in small and large ∆ limit are identical.

We shall now turn our attention to the behavior of
L when the spin chain is quenched from the paramag-
netic phase with ΓI = 10.0 to ferromagnetic phase with
ΓF = 0.5 across the Griffiths phase considering ∆ = 0.1
(see Fig.2c) and ∆ = 10.0 (see Fig.2d).
In this type
of quenching, the initial decay rate is much higher com-
pared to the same phase quenching as the eigenstates in
the ferromagnetic side become almost orthogonal to the
ground states associated with the paramagnetic phase.
Unlike the quenching inside same phase, here in contrary
for both type of coupling, we see that late time value of
LE becomes vanishingly small. The clean system shows
zero overlap after a certain time while LE for disordered
system still remains finite. In case of ∆ = 0.1, the val-
ues of L for both pure and disordered spin chain falls
drastically within a very small passage of time. Such
time scale is independent of the disorder strength. For
large ∆, this time scale is much shorter and surprisingly,
the clean system also decays almost identically with the
disordered system. After the initial rapid fall for strong
coupling case, there are oscillations in L for both clean
and disordered spin chain in the late time regime with
very slow fall; the amplitude of oscillation for pure sys-
tem is larger than the disorder spin chain. Although,
such oscillations die very quickly for both types of spin
chains.

Now, we shall investigate the temporal evolution of
LE in different time domains following various quench-
ing amplitudes. Let us begin with the ultra-short time
analysis of the LE to investigate the fall of L from unity.
We numerically study ultra-short time evolution of LE
for both low (∆ = 0.10) and high (∆ = 20.0) values of
coupling strength with Ω = 0.10. For both ∆ = 0.10
(see Fig.(3a)) and ∆ = 20.0 (see Fig.(3b)) the trans-
verse field is quenched from ΓI = 0.70 to the final value
ΓF = 0.5, 0.70, 0.90, 1.10. In this extremely short time
window, LEs for strong and weak coupling following dif-
ferent quench amplitudes coincide with each other.

Our numerical result shows that in both the situations,
a Gaussian fall is observed within a certain time scale
that depends on ∆. The fitting of L in ultra-short time
window for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quench with
∆ = 0.1 and ∆ = 20.0 are shown in Fig. (4a) and Fig.
(4b), respectively. The typical characteristic time scale
for ∆ ≪ 1 is given by t = 1, whereas, in case of high val-

6

ues of coupling strength i.e., ∆ ≫ 1, the value of charac-
teristic time is t = 1/∆. The ultra-short time the decay
of L follows a Gaussian fall which can be approximated
as L(t) ≃ exp(−αt2) ≈ 1 − αt2. Here, α determines the
rate of the fall and the power of t i.e., 2 signifies the
exponent for the Gaussian decay. We also check that
this decay rate α is marginally dependent of Ω for both
type of coupling. As expected, the rate α for strong cou-
pling is much higher compared to the weak coupling case.
Our study further indicates that quenching inside Grif-
fiths phase also lead to this ultra-short time Gaussian fall
as depicted in Fig. (4c) for ∆ = 0.1 and Fig. (4d) for
∆ = 20. Such Gaussian decay in ultra-short timescale
for clean system is already observed in [39]. Therefore,
one can say that the Gaussian fall observed in the ultra-
short time domain remains invariant even in presence of
disorder.

It has been found for a non spin preserving coupling
Hamiltonian HQ that rate α for the Gaussian decay is
dependent on the filling number of the ground state of
the bath; specifically, α exhibits plateaus as a function of
intra bath coupling and transverse field [42]. Using time
dependent perturbation theory it has been further con-
firmed analytically. The same line of argument is valid for
our case also only the interaction Hamiltonian changes.
Moreover, we find that α is marginally dependent on dis-
order strength and it is evident from fig. (4) that ultra
short time dynamics is mainly dictated by the initial pa-
rameter i.e., the value of transverse field. Hence, in gen-
eral, one can say that α strongly depends on the initial
state rather than the final state. To be precise, the rate is
shown to be in the form of (hH 2
Qi−hHQi2), where HQ is
the interaction Hamiltonian between qubit and the bath,
h···i represents the expectation value with respect to the
initial state of the bath [43].
At the outset, we expect that in general the decay ex-
ponent (i.e., power of t) depends on the disorder strength
and the coupling strength. Upon inspecting the Fig. (5)
and Fig. (6), one can remarkably see for quenching inside
the same phase that for the initial small time exponen-
tial fall, the decay exponent depends only on the coupling
strength; on the other hand, the decay exponent associ-
ated with the late time power law fall depends only on the
disorder strength. The quenching inside a Griffiths phase
as shown in Fig. (7) and Fig. (8) leads to a markedly dif-
ferent results in the long time regime; the power law fall
is completely absent here.

In order to investigate the temporal decay of LE with
disorder for the quenching inside paramagnetic phase
(ΓI = 10.0 to ΓF = 2.0) more extensively, we first study
the initial small time rapid decay.
In such time scale
the double logarithm of LE becomes linear with the log-
arithm of time. This indicates the small time faster fall
is exponential in nature. Our numerical analysis further
suggests that there exist more than a single exponen-
tial fall; LE scales as L(t) ∼ exp(−βtm) and the decay
exponent m takes two different values in two different
time regions confined within this overall exponential time

FIG. 5. (Color online) (a) The plot shows that LE L follows two types of exponential fall with time t for coupling strengths
varying from ∆ = 0.01 to 10.0. These two exponential fall are evident from two different slopes associated with the initial time
straight line (−3 < loge(t) < −1) and late time straight line (1 < loge(t) < 4), observed in double logarithmic of echo versus
logarithmic of time. It is noteworthy that these slopes acquire two distinct values for ∆ < 2 and ∆ > 2. (b) Plot shows that
for weak coupling limit (∆ = 0.1 < 2), these two exponential laws in two time domains indeed become independent of Ω. The
estimated values of the slopes in these time regions are m ≈ 3.25 ± 0.05 and m ≈ 1.50 ± 0.02 respectively. (c) Plot depicts the
exponential behavior quantitatively changes for strong coupling case (∆ = 10 > 2). The slopes are found to be m ≈ 2.00 ± 0.05
and m ≈ 0.75 ± 0.02. Here the transverse field is quenched from ΓI = 10.0 to ΓF = 2.0.

zone. The decay rate is encoded in β. The values of m in
such time domains depend on ∆ mainly. To reveal such
feature, we plot loge(− loge(L)) with loge(t) for a fixed
disorder strength Ω = 0.10 with several values of ∆ (see
Fig.5a). Inside each characteristic region of time, two sets
of parallel lines are obtained for ∆ < 2 and ∆ > 2. For
weak coupling, m changes from m ∼ 3.25 to m ∼ 1.50
(see Fig.5b). In the strong coupling limit, LE continues
to follow a Gaussian fall i.e., m ∼ 2.0 and in later time

the decay exponent is close to 0.75 (see Fig.5c). One can
clearly observe the LE for different Ω (for a given ∆) al-
most co-inside with each other. This refers to the fact
that decay exponent does not change with the disorder
strength.

We shall now focus on the late time behavior of LE for
the quenching inside the paramagnetic phase. We quench
the transverse filed ΓI = 10.0 to ΓF = 2.0. We observe
a late time slow power law fall of LE. Such fall can be

FIG. 6. (Color online) (a) Plot shows that the LE clearly exhibits long time power law behavior L(t) ∼ ct−θ. It is clearly
evident from the parallel nature of the logarithm of echo with different values of ∆ that the power law exponent θ is independent
of ∆ rather only depends on Ω. The value of power law exponent for this disorder strength is θ ≈ 0.25. (b) The variation of
loge(L) with loge(t) for Ω = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 are shown. Here the coupling strength ∆ = 0.10. It is observed that the magnitude
of θ decreases with the increase of Ω. The values of the exponents are 0.30, 0.24, 0.17 for Ω = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 respectively. (c) The
same variations are plotted with identical set of disorder strength. In this case ∆ = 10.0. We note that Ω dependence of the
power law exponent is quite prominent. In all of the cases, transverse field is quenched from ΓI = 10.0 to ΓF = 2.0.

described by L(t) ∼ ct−θ, where c determines the de-
cay rate, and θ is the decay exponent for the power law.
This late time power law decay of LE is universal for
weak and strong coupling case but time domain within
which this power law observed is dictated by the value
of the coupling strength. To demonstrate such charac-
teristic, we plot loge(L) with loge(t) for ∆ = 0.1, 10.0
with fixed disorder strength Ω = 0.4 (see Fig.6a). One
can clearly find that the straight lines corresponding to
different values of ∆ become parallel to each other; this
suggests the power law exponent is indeed independent
of coupling strength.
In order to investigate Ω depen-
dence of θ, we plot the variation of loge(L) with loge(t)
for several values Ω keeping coupling strength fixed at
∆ = 0.1 (see Fig.6b) and ∆ = 10.0 (see Fig.6c).
Irre-
spective of the value of coupling strength, we find that
magnitude of θ increases with the decrease of Ω. More-
over, we checked that the decay characteristics of LE (as
described by exponential and power law fall) for quench-
ing into a ferromagnetic phase from the paramagnetic
phase remain unaltered. However, we observed a change
in the extent of the time domains associated with the
different types of decay.

We shall now try to justify the above numerical find-
ing by plausible arguments. The ∆ dependent initial
exponential fall is consistent with the analytical results
in Refs. [39, 44]. The analytical treatments suggest the
decay rate is of the order of ∆2. Therefore one would
expect the initial exponential fall is dependent on cou-
pling strength and the initial value of the transverse field
rather than the disorder strength. On the other hand
the asymptomatic behavior of LE depends on the final
value of the quenched transverse field [44].
In a given
quenching scheme, the disorder strength determines the
final quenched values of transverse field at each spin site.
Therefore the late time fall of LE should be governed by
the disorder strength. Moreover, for strong disorder, the
difference between the initial and final values of the local

transverse field becomes small. As a result of that the
decay of LE is severely prohibited with the increment in
disorder strength. Such phenomena is exactly reflected
by our numerical study associated to the late time fall of
LE.

In parallel, we study the quenching inside the Grif-
fiths phase starting from a paramagnetic phase. Simi-
lar to the paramagnetic quenching case, the initial time
evolution of LE is governed by two types of exponential
fall: L(t) ∼ exp(−βtm) with two different values of m.
The decay exponent again predominantly depends on ∆
rather than Ω (see Fig.7a). In case of weak coupling, the
LE falls off initially with m ∼ 3.35 and the subsequent
exponential decay is accompanied with m ∼ 1.30 (see
Fig.7b). For strong coupling case, the primary exponen-
tial fall is Gaussian with m ∼ 2.0 and the final exponen-
tial decay is associated with m ∼ 0.70 (see Fig.7c).

Most interestingly, we find that LE decays to zero in
the late time limit (see Fig. (8)). This result can be
contrasted to the earlier results obtained for off-critical
quenching between same or different phases.
In order
to confirm the absence of the power law tail, logarithm
of LE is plotted as a function of logarithm of time; this
plot clearly depicts that logarithm of LE does not fit into
a straight line within a considerable time domain. The
point to note here is that as the slowly falling power tail
is absent the LE decays to zero more rapidly compared
to the other quenching cases. Therefore, the absence of
the late time power law fall is a dynamical signature of
the Griffiths phase. One can see that a tendency towards
a late time slow power law fall is observed for higher val-
ues of Ω as for some disorder realizations, environmental
Ising chain lies outside the Griffiths phase.

The outcome quantum Griffiths effect is that the rare
region is finite in space but infinite in imaginary time [46];
moreover, the broadening in the distribution of local re-
laxation time is another signature of Griffiths singular-
ity. Consequently, the effect of the local perturbation

FIG. 7. (Color online) We repeat the plots as shown in Fig. (5) for the quenching from paramagnetic to Griffiths phase. (a)
Plot depicts that with a given disorder strength Ω = 0.3, there are two different types of exponential fall in the time domains
−3 < loge(t) < −1 and 1 < loge(t) < 4, respectively. Here, coupling strengths are varied from ∆ = 0.01 to 10.0. (b) Plot
shows that for weak coupling limit (∆ = 0.1 < 2), the slopes indeed become independent of Ω like the paramagnetic quenching
case. In this case, the values of the exponents associated with the first and second exponential decay are m ≈ 3.35 ± 0.07
and m ≈ 1.30 ± 0.02, respectively. (c) Plot depicts the exponential behavior quantitatively changes for strong coupling case
(∆ = 10 > 2). The estimated values of slopes are m ≈ 2.00 ± 0.05 and m ≈ 0.70 ± 0.02. Here, the transverse field is quenched

FIG. 8. (Color online) We here show that LE does not exhibit
any slowly falling tail in the long time limit. The absence of
long time power law decay is a signature of Griffiths phase.
The LE for weak disorder case decays rapidly as compared to
the strong disorder case.The absence of power law is further
confirmed in the inset where it is shown that in logarithm of
LE does not follow a straight line with logarithm of time. Here
the transverse field is quenched from ΓI = 10.0 to ΓF = 1.03.

drops most rapidly (see Fig.2c,d), while LE drops most
slowly for same initial and final phases (see Fig.2a,b); for
quenching into Griffiths phase from paramagnetic phase,
LE attains an intermediate fall (see Fig.8). Although, the
functional form of decay remains exponential, the decay
rate, estimated from β in L(t) ∼ exp(−βtm), generically
depends on the disorder strength, types of quenching and
coupling strength. This decay rate is highest for quench-
ing between two different phases and smallest for quench-
ing between same phases. Moreover, this decay rate in-
creases with increasing disorder strength in the weak cou-
pling case. The same line of argument is also valid for
decay rate associated with late time power law fall. We
press the fact that disorder maximally influences the late
time slow fall than the short time exponential fall, dom-
inated by ∆, as for the clean spin chain, LE decays to a
much lower value in this late time limit. Hence, disorder
imprints a positive effect in preserving an entangled state
surrounded by a decohering environment.

(i.e., coupling to the qubit locally) is damped inside this
huge temporal window. This might cause the initial ex-
ponential fall to prevail over the late time power law fall.
The quantum Griffiths effect is absent in the PM and
FM phase. The distribution of local relaxation time gets
narrower leading to the fact that the effect of local pertur-
bation is not damped completely rather it is still present
in the long time. This might leads to the observation of
long time power law fall of LE. This is the way we think
that the characteristics of the spin chain gets imprinted
the behavior of LE. Therefore, concurrence between the
qubits is thus able to distinguish the phase of environ-
mental spin chain associated with a continuously varying
dynamical exponent.

Comparing the short time temporal behavior (i.e., ex-
ponential fall) of LE for different quenching case one can
see that when the initial and final phases are different, LE

C. Revival Time

In addition to the coupling strength, the dynamics of L
is also governed by the separation d between two qubits
coupled to the environmental spin chain. In this section,
we discuss the dynamics of L for both clean and disorder
spin chain of length N = 200. Before going to the dis-
ordered chain, we shall quickly review the clean case for
different values of d following a quench from ΓI = 1.50 to
ΓF = 0.99 as shown in Fig. (9a). We should mention that
such investigation has already been made with N = 100
in Ref [39] but we repeat (with different system size) this
numerical calculation to present a comparative study be-
tween the observations associated to the revival of LE
in pure and disordered spin chain. When the qubits are
connected symmetrically i.e., d = N/2, we find that echo
exhibits a linear decrease till t = τ1 ≃ N/8; afterwards,

FIG. 9. (Color online) The variation of L with time t for a given strength of disorder are shown: (a) for Ω = 0.0 (b) for 0.30
with different values of separation distance of two qubits d = 100, 99, 98, 95, 85. (c): The variation of L with time t for different

there are no singularity in the slope of L. We quenched the transverse field ΓI = 1.50 to ΓF = 0.99.

of L revives linearly till t = τ2 ≃ N/4. As one moves
away from the symmetric position by changing the sepa-
ration distance from d = N/2 to d = N/2 − 15, the time
scale τ1 gradually disappears.

Concentrating on the disordered case, we show the
variation of L with t for Ω = 0.30 with several values
of d as depicted in Fig. (9b). One can observe that a
substantial amount of disorder can wash out the above
dynamical characteristics appearing in L at t = τ1 and
t = τ2. The revival of LE after t = τ1 and the down-
turn at t = τ2 as obtained in pure case are absent in the
disordered spin chain. In this case, LE monotonically de-
creases with time. The LE for symmetric case exhibits
a higher value as compared to the non-symmetric posi-
tion. In order to investigate the disappearance of singu-
lar behavior of LE, we study the LE for different disorder
strength with a given d = N/2. This is pictorially shown
in Fig. (9c). One can see that as Ω increases, the revival
of LE at t = τ1 disappears, though, for small disorder
strength Ω = 0.1, LE still shows a tendency of revival.
This also happens for downturn time scale t = τ2. For
completeness, we also checked that for quenching inside
the Griffiths phase, the singular time scale τ1 and τ2 com-
pletely disappear. We note that the disappearance of
the singular time scale is not artifact of a particular N
rather it's originated from the randomness of the trans-
verse field.

In order to explain the disappearance of singularities,
we make resort to the quasiparticle picture in the post
quench regime. For the clean case, H(cid:21) and H⇈ are differ-
ent from each other with respect to the local transverse
fields modified at two sites, where the qubits are coupled.
In the language of quasi-particle emission after a quench,
one can think of two extra separate emitters, located d
distance away from each other. Now, in the symmetric
position d = N/2, quasi-particles need to travel only d/2
distance. Hence, there is a constructive interference hap-
pening that leads to a partial revival of the initial state.
Therefore, τ1 = d/2v = N/8 with velocity of the quasi-
particle v = 2. In contrast, for the disordered case, at
each point, the chain experiences a change in the trans-

verse field due to the finite value of disorder strength Ω;
hence, separate emitters, away by a distance d = N/2, do
not really play a role in this global generation of quasipar-
ticles. As an outcome of a very complicated propagation
of quasiparticles from all sites, the constructive interfer-
ence dies out and the appearance of the singular time
scale τ1 is lost. This explanation remains true for the ex-
tinction of all the singular time scales. This is also true
for quenching inside the Griffiths phase.

IV. CONCLUSION

We study the disentanglement of a Bell pair consti-
tuted of two qubits, which are connected to a disordered
transverse field Ising spin chain. We identify the disorder
induced Griffiths phase from the equilibrium study of LE.
On the other hand from the non-equilibrium evolution of
LE we exhaustively explore decay characteristics of the
entanglement of the qubits and the non-trivial outcomes
associated with the Griffiths phase.

In equilibrium, the derivative of LE with respect to ini-
tial transverse field is shown to exhibit a peak at critical
point of the clean Ising spin chain. The disorder present
only in the transverse field can lead to a local ordering
in the spin chain; this results in a Griffiths phase [28]
appearing at the junction of ferromagnetic and param-
agnetic phases. We here numerically estimate the extent
of the Griffith's phase as the derivative of LE exhibits
a peak near the boundary between Griffith's phase and
paramagnetic phase. However, such numerical evaluation
of the width of the Griffiths phase needs to be verified
analytically in further future studies.

From the non equilibrium study of the LE following off-
critical quenches, we show that the initial fall of the LE
is completely governed by the coupling strength. Such
observation fairly agrees with the earlier analytical con-
jectures in Refs [39, 44]. Our numerical investigation sug-
gests that the quantitative nature of the initial fall of LE
cannot be explain by a single exponential function. To be
precise, a ultra short time universal Gaussian fall is ob-

served, followed by two exponential falls with two differ-
ent decay exponents dependent on the coupling strength.
Within this time window, the disorder is not able to re-
flects its effect. Since the late time fall of LE depends on
the final quenched value of the transverse field [44], there-
fore the asymptomatic decay characteristics of LE should
be controlled by the disorder strength. The increase in
the value of disorder would increase the overlap between
the initial and the final state of the spin chain. Therefore
the initial fast exponential fall of LE is substantially sup-
pressed by the effect of disorder in the long time limit.
Consequently we observe a late time slow power law fall
of LE where the value of decay exponent decreases with
the increase of disorder strength. Regarding the non-
trivial outcome associated with the Griffiths phase, we
interestingly observe that for quenching to the Griffiths
phase, the late time power law fall is completely absent
while initial decay characteristics of LE is similar to that
of the for the off critical quenching. Hence, the initial ex-
ponential decay is related to the initial phase, in contrary
the final late time power law decay is connected to the
final phase of the spin chain. Therefore, the continuous
variation of the dynamical critical exponent and broad-
ening of relaxation time mark its signature in the late
time temporal profile of LE. This unique non-equilibrium
characteristics of LE for the Griffiths phase might initi-
ate further studies to identify the Griffiths phase in a
disordered spin systems.

Moreover, we show that as one increases disorder
strength, the singular behavior at t = N/8 and N/4
disappear; this is due to the fact that quasi-particles,
generated from all sites, interfere destructively and the
temporal structure, observed for clean system, is washed
out. Hence, the linearity between distance, traveled by
the quasiparticles, and time, required to travel that dis-
tance, breaks down for a substantial disorder strength.
This indicates that the quasi-particles do not propagate
in the light cone like fashion.

Specifically, the linear combinations of canonically an-
ticommuting Fermi field operators are replaced by linear
combinations of complex coefficients that are anticom-
muting Grassmann numbers. Based on this "Grassmann
algebra of canonical anticommutation relations", one can
calculate the expectation value of exp(iHpt) exp(−iHst)
with respect to the Gaussian states. The square of fi-
delity between two states ωs and ωp is given by Lp,s =
F (ωp, ωs)2. It has been shown that Lp,s = ωs(Ep) i.e.,
the expectation value of the support projection EP in
the state ωS. Using the concept of Gaussian Grassmann
integral, one can show that

v(ξ) exp(

ωs(Ep) = ZQ

1
2hξ∗, (1−P−S)ξiQ) = P f (1−P−S)
(14)
where ξ is the phase space vector, P and S are two pro-
jected covariant operators associated with the states ωp
and ωs, respectively. P f represents the pfaffian of a ma-
trix. v(ξ) is the normalization factor, Q indicates the pro-
jection to initial ground state. One can use the relation
P f (A)2 = det(A) to show that Lp,s = det(1− P − S)1/2.
Now, connecting to the present case, ωs,p ≡ Π↑↑,↓↓i
(5) of the
and Hs,p ≡ H↑↑,↓↓. One can consider Eq.
main text and ωs,p = e−iHs,ptφgi to arrive at the above
connections. We note that φgi, being the ground state
of initial Hamiltonian HI (ΓI ), is time evolved with the
quenched final Hamiltonian H↓↓,↑↑(ΓF , ∆) to obtain the
final states Π↓↓,↑↑i. Similarly, P (S) is the time evolved
initial occupation matrix, calculated using transverse
field value ΓI , with Hamiltonian HP (ΓF , ∆)(HS(ΓF , ∆)).
The explicit form of the covariant matrix P (S) is then
given by

P (S) = exp(iHp,st)L(0) exp(iHp,st)

(15)

where L(0) is the initial occupation matrix composed of
c and c†. This can be computed by diagonalizing the
initial Hamiltonian HI (ΓI ) as stated in Eq. (8).
