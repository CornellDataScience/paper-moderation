We analyze and give estimates for the long-distance coupling via floating metallic gates between
different types of spin qubits in quantum dots made of different commonly used materials. In partic-
ular, we consider the hybrid, the singlet-triplet, and the spin-1/2 qubits, and the pairwise coupling
between each type of these qubits with another hybrid qubit in GaAs, InAs, Si, and Si0.9Ge0.1.
We show that hybrid qubits can be capacitively coupled strongly enough to implement two-qubit
gates, as long as the distance of the dots from the metallic gates is small enough. Thus, hybrid
qubits are good candidates for scalable implementations of quantum computing in semiconducting
nanostructures.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most promising ways to implement the con-
cept of quantum computation1 is to use the spins of elec-
trons in quantum dots as qubits2. Quantum dots fabri-
cated in semiconductor nanostructures are used to con-
fine electrons, which can then be manipulated and mea-
sured by electrical gates3. Many generalizations of qubits
in quantum dots have been proposed and explored over
the years4 -- 6. A recent interesting addition is a proposal
for a so-called hybrid qubit7 -- 10 formed in a double quan-
tum dot (DQD) by different states of three electrons,
where both charge and spin degrees of freedom of the
electrons play a role. Since all types of spin qubits have
their specific weaknesses and strengths, it is useful to ask
if one can combine various types of such qubits to make
optimal use of their particular advantages.

Furthermore, to successfully implement quantum com-
putation, scalable architectures consisting of many qubits
are needed. One of the possibilities to achieve such a
goal is to couple the qubits in quantum dots over a long
distance by using a metallic floating gate11. In this pro-
posal, quantum dots could be hundreds of micrometers
apart from each other, coupled in a similar way as elec-
tronic components are coupled by wires.

Here, we extend the proposal of Ref. 11 and study
the long-distance coupling between the newly introduced
hybrid qubit7 -- 10 and other types of qubits theoretically.
For this, we consider two lateral DQDs3,4,12 -- 14 that are
separated so far from each other that tunnel coupling is
impossible. A floating metallic gate enables a capacitive
coupling that depends on the positions of the DQDs with
respect to the gate and that can therefore be controlled
electrically. We study different host materials such as
Si or GaAs, analyze the dependence of the qubit-qubit
interaction on several system parameters, and find that
strong interactions are achievable which can be used to
implement entangling two-qubit gates with short opera-
tion times.

There are three different qubit combinations we con-

and the other DQD three electrons, i.e., one DQD hosts
a singlet-triplet (ST) qubit12,15,16 and the other one a
hybrid qubit. In these two cases a spin-orbit interaction
(SOI) is not required, since the qubit-qubit coupling can
be induced solely by the Coulomb interaction and the
Pauli exclusion principle. In the third case, we consider
a system where one of the DQDs is singly occupied form-
ing the spin-1/2 (LD) qubit2,17 and the second one is
triply occupied, i.e., a hybrid qubit. Each of these three
cases will be studied separately. However, it is important
to mention that experimentally it is possible to realize
the different schemes within the very same experimental
setup by only modifying the voltages on the gates.

The paper is organized as follows. First in Sec. II
we focus on the H-H and H-ST qubit-qubit couplings
in GaAs. Then, in Sec. III we calculate the H-LD cou-
pling in GaAs, and in Sec. IV we analyze the dependence
on the setup geometry and compare all the couplings in
four different semiconducting materials commonly used
for the fabrication of quantum dots, namely GaAs, InAs,
Si, and Si0.9Ge0.1. Finally, in Sec. V we summarize and
give some conclusions. A detailed derivation of the elec-
trostatic coupling via floating gates, the expansion of the
electrostatic potential and details of a used Schrieffer-
Wolff transformation are appended.

II. H-H AND H-ST COUPLING

The DQD hybrid qubit, introduced recently in Ref. 8,
operates on three different three-electron-states as illus-
trated in Fig. 1. In order to implement a universal set of
quantum gates, one must be able to couple such qubits
to each other pairwise18.

The idea pursued here is to couple two such hybrid-
qubits over a (possibly long) distance via a floating gate
in the way proposed in Ref. 11 and to estimate the
strength of the resulting coupling between them. This
setup is promising due to its simplicity and scalabil-
ity and provides a pathway for implementing large-scale
quantum computing architectures. The coupling is me-
diated through the Coulomb interaction of the induced

logical state 0(cid:105) is defined as 0(cid:105) = S(cid:105)↓(cid:105), where S(cid:105) is the
singlet of the two electrons in the ground state of the first dot
and ↓(cid:105) denotes the electron with spin down in the second dot.
where T0(cid:105) (T−(cid:105)) is the two-electron triplet state in the first
dot with spin projection zero (−1) along the quantization axis,
and ↑(cid:105) denotes the electron with spin up in the second dot.
Our diagram for 1(cid:105) is a simplified sketch of T0(cid:105)↓(cid:105). The state
E(cid:105) = ↓(cid:105)S(cid:105) depicted on the right is used as an intermediate
state to prepare the logical states. We note that each of these
three states can be written in the simple form "orbital part
× spin part", because additional corrections are negligible in
our calculations of the coupling strengths.

charges on the floating gate caused by the charge dis-
tributions in the qubits. As the different states of the
hybrid qubit have different charge distributions (in con-
trast to qubits based on the spin states of a single quan-
tum dot when SOI is absent), it is sufficient to take into
account the Coulomb interaction in order to estimate the
coupling. Thus, one may assume that the hybrid qubit
is a charge qubit and may disregard the spin degrees of
freedom (which are on the other hand important for the
noise and decoherence description).

(blue) and two DQDs (red dots). b) Sketch of the confinement
potential of a DQD. Here, a0 is an in-plane distance between
the floating gate disc center and the DQD, d is the vertical
distance between the floating gate disc center and the DQD,
R is the radius of the floating gate disc, L is the length of the
section connecting the discs, Rw is the radius of this section
(modelled as a wire), λ is the length of the DQD and l is the
distance between the DQD minima.

Following Refs. 11 and 19, we now describe the setup
analytically. The induced charge in a disc of the floating
gate due to an electron at position r is

Qind(r) =

arcsin(R/ξr),

Assuming that the electron occupies a quantum dot (or
DQD in our case) within the two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) of a heterostructure, the vertical distance
d between the electron and the disc corresponds to the
distance between the floating gate and the 2DEG, as il-
lustrated in Fig. 2a. The coordinates x and y describe
the in-plane position of the electron, where the origin
0 = x = y was chosen below the center of the disc.

When one electron is located near the first disc of the
floating metallic gate and another electron is located near
the second disc, the two electrons are electrostatically
coupled and the associated potential energy is21

where r1 and r2 are the positions of the two electrons
with respect to their nearby disc, 0 is the vacuum per-
mittivity, r is an effective relative permittivity that de-
pends on the details of the setup, and αq = Cd/(Cw +
2Cd) is a charge-distribution factor that is determined by
the capacitances Cd and Cw of the discs and the connect-
ing wire, respectively, of the floating gate11. A detailed
derivation of Eq. (3) is provided in Appendix A.

In order to obtain an estimate of the interaction we
need to model the charge distributions in the DQDs for
the different logical states. Electrons in the DQDs are
trapped inside the two overlapping two-dimensional (2D)
parabolic potential wells (see Fig. 2b), thus their orbital
states in each quantum dot are in good approximation
the same as the eigenstates of the 2D simple harmonic
oscillator (SHO)22. The electron density in a quantum
dot, which differs from the charge density only by the
factor −e (electron charge), can therefore be modeled
by summing up the probability densities of the occupied
SHO states.

The probability density in the ground state of a SHO
is Gaussian and in the first excited state23 we have two
disjoint peaks shifted with respect to the center of the
single-particle level spacing in the quantum dot and m∗
is the effective mass of the electron. We define λ = l+2λ0
as the length of the DQD, where l is the distance between
the minima of the potential (see Fig. 2b). Using a model
as described above, with 2D continuous charge distribu-
tions in the plane of a 2DEG, we obtain the following
expression for the electrostatic coupling of the two states

merically. However, in order to gain more insight, we
will also evaluate the Vij analytically by substituting the
Gaussian wave functions by delta functions, thus consid-
ering the interaction of point charges.

The electron densities in Eq. (4) depend not only on
the DQD potentials but also on the positions of the DQDs
with respect to the discs of the floating gate. For our es-
timate of the feasible coupling strengths, we assume that
the two DQDs have the same dimensions and the same
relative positions. More precisely, we choose the two min-
ima of a DQD potential to lie on the x axis (which can be
an arbitrary in-plane direction due to the circular sym-
metry of the discs and which may, in fact, be different
for each disc), with the first minimum at x = a0 and
the second minimum at x = a0 + l. The parameter a0
corresponds to the in-plane distance from the disc cen-
ter, as sketched in Fig. 2. In order to enable two-qubit
gates with short operation times, this distance should be
chosen such that the energies Vij differ strongly when
changing the qubit states. In Ref. 11, it was shown that
the floating-gate-mediated coupling between two charges
is most sensitive to small variations in their positions
when the charges are placed below the edges of the discs.
Therefore, we set a0 = R in our model, and in our case
of DQDs we choose the dots below the edges of the discs
(x = R) to be the ones whose charge distributions de-
pend strongest on the qubit states. Our assumptions are
illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows both the point charge
approximation and the continuous charge distribution for
a hybrid qubit.

sum over m and n runs over all possible pairs of electrons
that do not occupy the same DQD and v is the electro-
static electron-electron coupling introduced in Eq. (3).
As the Coulomb interaction does not contain any spin
operators, the spins of the states are always conserved.
Thus, because the logical states are orthogonal in spin
space, we get (where i, j, k, l = 0, 1, E)
(cid:104)i, j V k, l(cid:105) = δikδjlVkl.

(6)
The used notation k, l(cid:105) for a two-qubit state means here
that the qubit at the first (second) disc is in state k(cid:105)
(l(cid:105)). As an example we can write the expression for one
of the matrix elements in the point charge approximation
as follows

(7)

where v(x1, x2) denotes the Coulomb interaction of two
electrons placed at the positions x1, x2. The charge in the
hybrid qubit is equal to three elementary charges, thus
the sum of the prefactors of all terms in Eq. (7) must be
nine.

Due to the aforementioned orthogonality in spin space,
projection of V onto the subspace spanned by the two-
qubit states 0, 0(cid:105), 0, 1(cid:105), 1, 0(cid:105), and 1, 1(cid:105) yields a diagonal
4×4 matrix

V = diag (V00, V01, V01, V11) ,

(8)

where we used V01 = V10. We can construct a two-qubit
gate that is equivalent to the CNOT gate up to single-
qubit operations as follows24,

imation we model the charge distribution via delta functions
localized at the positions (x coordinates) shown by dotted
lines, with the corresponding charges written in multiples of

we use for the charge distributions the corresponding eigen-
functions of the parabolic potential.

the spatial dimensions of the DQDs we assume λ =
250 nm and l = 150 nm, furthermore d = 100 nm for
the vertical distance and R = a0 = 4d. We estimate
αq = 0.19 from11

(13)

with L = 10 µm and Rw = 30 nm as the length and
radius, respectively, of the thin wire that connects the
two discs. Considering GaAs as the host material, we use
r = 13 (the effective value may in fact be smaller, which
would increase the coupling) and note that λ0 = 50 nm
and the effective electron mass result in ω (cid:39) 0.5 meV.
With these values, which are similar to those in Ref. 11,
we obtain CH-H = 2.0 × 10−10 eV from the point charge
approximation, while CH-H = 2.6 × 10−10 eV from the
continuous charge distributions.

Since these results agree very well, we conclude that
the numerical integration is well reproduced by the point
charge approximation. One can significantly increase the
coupling by varying the setup parameters. The coupling
is most significantly dependent on the vertical distance
d. Assuming that d = 10 nm can be realized, we are
able to obtain a coupling strength of CH-H = 1 µeV (see
Sec. IV).

Next we study the interaction between the ST qubit,
i.e., singlet-triplet states of two electrons in the DQD,
and the hybrid qubit, i.e., three electrons in the DQD
with states 0(cid:105), 1(cid:105), and E(cid:105), see Fig. 3. We assume the
DQD for the ST qubit to be in the strongly detuned
regime, thus the singlet state is effectively a (2,0) charge
state and the triplet state is effectively a (1,1) charge
state (excited orbital states of the dots that form the
DQD cannot be occupied). Then we are able to calculate
the matrix elements, for instance

(cid:104)S, 1 V S, 1(cid:105) = 2v(R, R) + v(R, R − b)

+v(R, R + b) + 2v(R, R + l).

(14)

Proceeding analogously to the case of two H qubits, we
find a qubit-qubit interaction of the form CH-STσz
1σz
2,
where we obtain CH-ST = 5.5 × 10−9 eV for the point
charges and CH-ST = 1.4 × 10−8 eV for the continu-
ous charge distributions. As a check of the numerics
we additionally calculate the ST-ST coupling with the
continuous distributions and compare it to the expected
value of 10−5 -- 10−6 eV obtained from Ref. 11. We get23
CST-ST = 7.5 × 10−7 eV.

It is then interesting to ask why the obtained H-H and
H-ST couplings are much smaller than in the ST-ST case.
When we look at the logical states 0(cid:105) and 1(cid:105) of the
hybrid qubit, we can see that the charge distribution in
the second quantum dot is the same in both logical states,
thus the second quantum dot gives us no contribution to
the coupling, in contrast to the states of the ST qubit.
Moreover, the charge difference between the singlet and
the triplet states in the single dot is small, δq = 4.7 ×

4

10−5e according to the calculations in Ref. 25, in contrast
to the charge difference between the singlet and triplet
states in the ST qubit where δq = 2.7 × 10−2e.
It is worth mentioning that when we use the state E(cid:105)
instead of 1(cid:105) as a computational basis state for the hy-
brid qubit, we obtain much larger couplings due to the
different charge configurations in both wells in the dif-
ferent logical states. For H-H and H-ST we get about
the same coupling strengths, CH-H ≈ CH-ST ≈ 0.1 µeV,
which is on the order of what one would expect for the
charge qubit. In the next section we will pursue this idea
further, because in order to implement the H-LD cou-
pling it will be necessary to work in the 0(cid:105), E(cid:105) basis.

Finally, we note that a magnetic field is not needed to
obtain the H-H, H-ST, and ST-ST couplings. However,
a magnetic field is usually applied in order to energeti-
cally separate the qubit subspace from other states. The
presence of an out-of-plane field, if required, can easily
be included by using states of Fock-Darwin type, whose
spatial extent decreases (effective confinement increases)
with increasing field strength26,27. When the magnetic
field lies in the plane of the 2DEG, which is the case
in most present-day experiments7,14,16,28,29 , its effects
on the orbital states are negligible because of the strong
and narrow vertical confinement potential. As a conse-
quence, neither magnetic fields nor SOI are important for
the estimates of this section and we can omit them in the
calculations. This is in stark contrast to the LD qubits
discussed in the next section, where the qubit-qubit cou-
pling depends strongly on both the SOI and the magnetic
field.

III. H-LD COUPLING

In this section we want to evaluate the coupling be-
tween the hybrid qubit in a DQD and the LD qubit in a
single quantum dot. Given the coordinate system intro-
duced in the previous section, we assume that the center
of the quantum dot that hosts a LD qubit is located at
x = a0 and y = 0. For the sake of simplicity in the nota-
tion, the coordinate system which we use in the present
section is shifted such that its origin 0 = x = y and the
center of the quantum dot coincide.

The Hamiltonian of the single quantum dot reads

HLD = H0 + HZ + HSOI

The px and py are kinetic momentum operators, g is the

lies in the plane of the 2DEG, i.e., B = (Bx, By, Bz) =
B (cos φ, sin φ, 0), where B = B. In this case, orbital
effects due to B are negligible and one can simply use
px,y = −i∂x,y. The Zeeman energy induced by B is
EZ = gµBB. The Rashba SOI parameter is defined as
α =
, where λSO is the spin-orbit length. We as-
sume that the SOI is relatively weak and are interested in
the regime 1 (cid:29) EZ
λSO . (We allow EZ and λSO to
be positive or negative depending on the sign of g and α,
respectively. As these signs, however, cannot affect the
absolute values of the qubit-qubit couplings in our model,
the parameters in our calculations will always be chosen
positive.) In order to remove HSOI in the first order, we
can therefore employ a Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) transforma-
tion26. The details are described in Appendix B.

The floating gate couples the three electrons forming
the hybrid qubit, labeled by positions r1, r2, r3, to the
electron of the LD qubit, labeled by re, via the potential

V (re, r1, r2, r3) = v(re, r1)+v(re, r2)+v(re, r3) (19)

from Eq. (5). By expanding this electrostatic potential
around the positions where the confining potential of the
dots is minimal, we obtain an effective term Hint that
describes the floating-gate-mediated interaction between
the electrons,

Hint = ηxe(x1 + x2 + x3),

The details of this expansion are provided in Appendix C.
Remarkably, the term Hint is equivalent to that of an elec-
tric field applied along the DQD axis, and the strength
of this electric field depends on the coordinate xe of the
electron in the quantum dot for the LD qubit. We are
now interested in the energy difference

J01 = (cid:104)0 Hint 0(cid:105) − (cid:104)1 Hint 1(cid:105)

(22)
which Hint causes between the logical states 0(cid:105) and 1(cid:105)
of the hybrid qubit. As sketched in Fig. 3, the charge
distributions of the states 0(cid:105) and 1(cid:105) differ only in one
valley of the DQD, because one of the two electrons that
occupy this valley is raised to an excited orbital state
when 0(cid:105) changes to 1(cid:105). Consequently, we find J01 = 0
in our model, as it is known that an electric field applied
to a SHO leads to a constant shift of all energy levels. It
has already been proposed8 to use the state E(cid:105) instead
of 1(cid:105) to perform a two-qubit gate as the charge difference
between those states is large and one can easily pulse the
state 1(cid:105) into E(cid:105). One finds that

J0E = (cid:104)0 Hint 0(cid:105) − (cid:104)E Hint E(cid:105)

(23)
is non-zero, as a qubit based on the states 0(cid:105) and E(cid:105) is
effectively a charge qubit, see Fig. 3.
The orbital wave functions of the states 0(cid:105) and E(cid:105) in

the DQD are well approximated by

ψ0 = ψL(x1, y1)ψL(x2, y2)ψR(x3, y3),
ψE = ψL(x1, y1)ψR(x2, y2)ψR(x3, y3),

Using these orbital wave functions one gets J0E =

(28)

where the Pauli operator τz satisfies τz 0(cid:105) = 0(cid:105) and
τz E(cid:105) = −E(cid:105).

Finally, we can calculate the H-LD qubit-qubit
coupling by
aforementioned SW
transformation26. As explained in detail in Appendix B,

states of the Pauli operator σz(cid:48) = σx cos φ + σy sin φ,
apart from small (higher-order) corrections. When we
apply the same transformation to Hint, keeping in mind
that xe in Eq. (28) corresponds to x in Eqs. (29) and
(30), we identify

[T1, Hint] = CH-LDσy(cid:48)τz

(31)

as the H-LD coupling. We note that the form of this
qubit-qubit coupling differs from those in Sec. II because
the axes of the Pauli operators σz(cid:48) and σy(cid:48) = σz are
perpendicular to each other. The strength of the H-LD
coupling is

x axis of our coordinate system is tuned to π/4, it then
follows from Eq. (B10) in Ref. 11 that the Dresselhaus
SOI coefficient β induces a simple shift of the Rashba
SOI as α = α + β. The same effect can also be achieved
by choosing the in-plane magnetic field along the x axis,
regardless of the value of γ, and in this case we have
α = α + β sin(2γ).

As evident from Eq. (32), we can obtain a stronger
H-LD coupling by using a quantum dot material with a
stronger SOI (like InAs). To verify this statement, we
calculated the couplings for the fixed setup parameters
mentioned before for different materials, with the follow-
ing material parameters: for GaAs11 λSO = 2.0×10−6 m,
m∗ = 0.067me, ω = 0.5 meV, r = 13, for InAs30 λSO =
1.64×10−7 m, m∗ = 0.023me, ω = 1.3 meV, r = 15.15,
in Si31 λSO = 2.6×10−5 m, m∗ = 0.26me, ω = 0.1 meV,
32 λSO = 2 × 10−5 m,
r = 11.7, and for Si0.9Ge0.1
m∗ = 0.19me, ω = 0.2 meV, r = 12.2. We have chosen
ω in every material such that it is experimentally well ac-
cessible and keeps λ0 close to 50 nm. The Zeeman energy
is always set to EZ = 0.5ω. Given these parameters,
the results for the qubit-qubit couplings CH-H, CH-ST,
and CH-LD are listed in Table I. However, the couplings
for this setup are rather small.
If we want to further
enhance them, we need to consider smaller geometries.
The simplest way is to equally shorten the distance d, the
disc radius R, and the horizontal distance a0 between the
centers of disc and dot, such that a0 = R = 4d is pre-
served. Reducing R also results in a small decrease of
αq, which however does not dominate the parameter de-
pendence of the qubit-qubit couplings. As expected from
Eqs. (1) -- (3), the couplings depend strongest on the ver-
tical distance d between the dots and the metallic gate.
To quantify this dependence, we calculated the couplings
again for two smaller setups. In Table II, we present the
results for currently feasible5 fabrication parameters with
d = 57 nm, R = a0 = 228 nm, and αq = 0.13, and in Ta-
ble III for d = 10 nm, R = a0 = 40 nm, and αq = 0.03
to demonstrate the strong dependence on d. The param-
eters λ = 250 nm and l = 150 nm of the DQD and the
angle φ = 0 of the magnetic field in the H-LD case are
always fixed.

As anticipated, a strong SOI is needed for implement-
ing the H-LD coupling, which is why the calculated
CH-LD in Tables I -- III are largest for InAs. In order to
enhance the relatively weak H-LD couplings in Si and
Si0.9Ge0.1, one can add a micromagnet33 -- 35 to the setup,
because the magnetic field gradient caused by a micro-
magnet can result in a very strong effective SOI. Con-
sidering the transformation discussed in Sec. III and Ap-
pendix B, one obtains36 -- 38

where S1 is the antihermitian operator of Eq. (29) and
B · σ = B (σx cos φ + σy sin φ) due to the in-plane mag-
netic field.
In particular, when we choose φ = 0 as in
our calculations for CH-LD in Tables I -- III, the trans-
formed Zeeman term is simply gµBBxσz/λSO, which cor-
responds to the effect of an out-of-plane magnetic field
that increases linearly with the coordinate x. Assum-
ing that the micromagnet provides such a magnetic field

btot = bMM +

.

(34)

Consequently, even if a material does not feature Rashba
or Dresselhaus SOI at all, a spin-orbit length of the or-
der of 2B/bMM can be induced by a micromagnet (the
estimate presented here applies when λSO (cid:29) λ0). Ex-
perimental setups with bMM ∼ 1 T/µm are already well
feasible35, which results in an effective spin-orbit length
λSO ∼ 2 × 10−6 m when we keep our other parameters
for the Si and Si0.9Ge0.1 setups unchanged. In both Si
and Si0.9Ge0.1, we find that the considered gradient from
the micromagnet increases the H-LD couplings by an or-
der of magnitude. For instance, using the setup with
d = 10 nm and micromagnets to enhance the SOI, one
can reach CH-LD ∼ 0.5 µeV for Si 2DEGs.

For a comparison of the H-H and H-ST couplings in
Tables I -- III, it is important to keep in mind that the
materials differ from each other only in the relative per-
mittivities r and effective masses m∗ in the context of
this calculation. As we chose different values of ω for the
different materials, such that the confinement length λ0
is approximately constant, we find that the listed values
of CH-H and CH-ST are quite similar, because it is evi-
dent from Sec. II that the couplings CH-H and CH-ST are
independent of m∗ when λ0 is fixed. Thus, the small dif-
ferences that remain in the H-H and H-ST cases between
the couplings obtained for the various 2DEGs are solely
caused by the small variations in λ0 and the relative per-
mittivity.

In our analysis of the charge distributions in the states
of single and double quantum dots, we assumed that all
wave functions of excited states have an excited orbital
part.
In Si, we therefore assume that the orbital level
spacing ω = 0.1 meV is smaller than the valley split-
ting, which is reasonable because reported valley split-
tings are of the order of 0.1 -- 1 meV39 -- 42. For instance,
Ref. 42 reports an electrically tunable valley splitting in
the range of 0.3 -- 0.8 meV for a quantum dot in Si/SiO2.
Consequently, forming Si quantum dots with sufficiently
large valley splittings is clearly possible (analogous for
Si0.9Ge0.1).

At the end of this section, we would like to summarize
some important dependences of the qubit-qubit couplings
on the sample parameters. For the H-H coupling, we
can conclude from Eqs. (1) -- (3) that CH-H ∼ 1
R , and
the same applies of course to the H-ST coupling CH-ST.
Moreover, Eq. (32) reveals that CH-LD ∼ B, α, ω−2 for
the H-LD coupling.

Finally, we wish to emphasize that additional elec-
tric gates, which are used to control and manipulate the
qubits in an experimental setup, were not yet included
in our calculations. As shown in Ref. 11, the influence of
these surrounding gates can increase the qubit-qubit cou-
plings by another two orders of magnitude, which makes

the hybrid qubit a highly promising platform for quan-

tum computation.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied an experimentally realizable setup
which allows different types of qubits in DQDs to be cou-
pled over long distances. In particular, we have shown
that using a metallic floating gate, it is possible to capac-
itively couple the hybrid qubit to a single spin 1/2, to a
singlet-triplet qubit, or to another hybrid qubit. First we
employed a simple approximation, where the charge den-
sity within the quantum dot is treated as a point charge
distribution, and calculated the couplings between two
hybrid qubits as well as between the ST and the hy-
brid qubit. Furthermore, we have verified the validity of
the point charge approximation by numerically integrat-
ing over the continuous charge distribution within each
quantum dot. Next, we have calculated perturbatively
the coupling between the LD and the hybrid qubit, as-
suming that the latter is based on the states 0(cid:105) and E(cid:105).
In order to investigate the influence of the quantum dot
material and the setup geometry, we have calculated the
couplings for the four semiconducting materials GaAs,
InAs, Si, Si0.9Ge0.1, and the three different setups of Ta-
bles I -- III.

As anticipated, the strongest H-LD coupling is ob-

tained with InAs, which features the strongest SOI. Nev-
ertheless, as explained in Sec. IV, micromagnets enable
a strong, effective SOI (and therefore strong H-LD cou-
plings) even in materials where the intrinsic SOI is weak,
such as Si or Si0.9Ge0.1.

For setups with a small distance d = 10 nm between
the 2DEG and the floating gate, our calculated H-LD,
H-ST, and H-H couplings are of the order of one mi-
croelectronvolt (see Table III), which leads to very fast
two-qubit gates with subnanosecond operation times. In
fact, such short time scales may already be possible with
present-day samples (see Table II, d = 57 nm), assuming
that the qubit-qubit couplings increase by two orders of
magnitude, as simulated in Ref. 11, when all elements of
the sample, especially all the electric gates, are included
in the calculation.

In conclusion, we showed that hybrid qubits can be
very strongly coupled over long distances via floating
metallic gates, enabling long-range two-qubit gates with
short operation times and all-electrical control. This ap-
plies to all of the studied materials, including Si and
Si0.9Ge0.1. We note that Ge and Si can be grown nuclear-
spin-free and are therefore highly useful for implement-
ing spin qubits with long dephasing times14. Our results

prove that hybrid qubits are a promising platform for
quantum information processing and quantum computa-
tion with spins in quantum dots.

Appendix A: Derivation of the electron-electron

coupling mediated by the floating gate

In this appendix we explain Eqs. (1) -- (3) of the main
text in more detail and provide an intuitive picture for
the derivation of the electrostatic electron-electron inter-
action described by Eq. (3).

We consider a thin conducting disc of radius R and
assume for now that it is grounded. When an electron is
located nearby, the charge19

Qind(r) =

2e
π

arcsin(R/ξr)

(A1)

is induced in the disc, where e is the elementary positive
charge. Defining the center of the disc as the origin of
the coordinate system, the ellipsoidal coordinate ξr > R
is related to the position r = (x, y, z) of the electron via

(cid:113)

r = R2 + x2 + y2 + z2

(A3)

that satisfies ξr > R21. The Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem was chosen here such that the disc lies in the x-y
plane. It is important to note that Eq. (A1) for the in-
duced charge does not change when we allow the system
to be immersed in a dielectric medium with relative per-
mittivity r. This might initially be surprising, but it be-
comes easily comprehensible when one keeps in mind that
the electrostatic potential due to the electron and the
induced charge Qind must compensate at the grounded
disc. Keeping Qind fixed, the potential of both the elec-
tron and the disc are inversely proportional to r (which
is also seen, for instance, in the capacitance 8r0R of a
disc in a dielectric), and so the solution for Qind must in-
deed be independent of the relative permittivity. In our
setup (Fig. 2), where vacuum above the floating gates and
different layers of materials may be involved, small cor-
rections to Eq. (A1) can be expected which, however, will
only have minor quantitative effects on our results. A de-
tailed derivation of Eq. (A1) is provided in Ref. 19, using

8

the aforementioned assumption that the disc is grounded.
In fact, even though the attached wire and the second
disc of our floating gate correspond to a finite reservoir,
the assumption of a grounded disc is not satisfied because
the floating gate is isolated and so the total charge in the
gate must be conserved. Nevertheless, as explained in
the following, Eq. (A1) can be exploited to calculate the
steady-state charge distribution of the floating gate.

Given our gate geometry of Fig. 2, we now assume that
an electron is brought close to one of the discs, referred
to as disc 1. After a very short (subpicosecond) time11,
much shorter than the typical duration of a quantum op-
eration on a qubit, the charge distribution in the metallic
gate will have reached a steady state which can be de-
scribed by the following simple requirements,

− Qind,1

,

Qd1 + Qw + Qd2 = 0.

(A4)

(A5)

With Eq. (A4), we exploit that the floating gate is con-
ducting, and so the potential at disc 1, the connecting
wire, and disc 2 must be the same. Equation (A5) arises
from charge conservation in the floating gate. The in-
troduced quantities Qd1, Qw, and Qd2 are the charges
in disc 1, the wire, and disc 2, respectively. The capaci-
tance of the wire is Cw and, assuming a symmetric gate
geometry, each of the two discs has the capacitance Cd.
The term −Qind,1/Cd on the left-hand side of Eq. (A4)
accounts for the additional potential at disc 1 which re-
sults from the external electron.
If Qd1 = Qind,1, this
term is exactly compensated, and so Qind,1 can be in-
terpreted as the charge that would be induced in disc 1
and that would remain there if the disc were grounded
[see also Eq. (A1)]. Solving the system of three equa-
tions contained in Eqs. (A4) and (A5) yields the charge
distribution in the steady state,

Qd1 = Qind,1
Qw = −Qind,1
Qd2 = −Qind,1

In particular, defining

(A6)

(A7)

(A8)

(A9)

we see from Eq. (A8) that the electron near disc 1 results
in a charge Qd2 = −αqQind,1 in disc 2.

Next, we analyze the electric potential around the sec-
ond disc, which is charged by Qd2. When a thin conduct-
ing disc with radius R and charge Q is surrounded by a
dielectric with relative permittivity r, the potential at a
position r = (x, y, z) with ξr > R is

Φ(r) =

(A10)

Again, the ellipsoidal coordinate ξr is given by Eq. (A2)
if the disc lies in the x-y plane of the chosen Cartesian
coordinate system and if the center of the disc and the
origin coincide. The result in Eq. (A10) is identical with
those provided, e.g., in Refs. 19 and 43, keeping in mind
some properties of inverse trigonometric functions such
as

arcsin(R/ξr) = arctan

Appendix C: Expansion of the interaction potential

When we expand the electrostatic potential in Sec. III
around the positions of the quantum dots, we follow the
approach discussed in Appendix B of Ref. 11. In the fol-
lowing, we focus on the expansion of the term v(re, r1),
as the other terms v(re, r2) and v(re, r3) are expanded
analogously.

We assume that the quantum dot that hosts the LD
qubit is located below the edge of one of the metallic
discs. Referring to the coordinate system introduced in
Sec. II (2DEG in x-y plane, origin 0 = x = y below

for ξr > R. In our setup, the potential within the mate-
rial below disc 2 is therefore well described by

Φ(r2) =

Qd2

4πr0R

arcsin(R/ξr2 ),

(A13)

Since

where the subscript added to r2 and ξr2 refers to the
second disc and where r may be replaced by an effective
value if, e.g., the floating gate is located at the sample
surface (partially in vacuum) or if the sample consists of
multiple layers.

Finally, we can combine the previous equations and
calculate the electron-electron coupling mediated by the
floating gate. Given our result for Φ(r2), Eq. (A13), the
associated potential energy v of an electron below disc 2 is
simply −eΦ(r2). Referring to the position of the electron
below disc 1 as r1, the combination of Eqs. (A1), (A8),
(A9), and (A13) yields

v(r1, r2) =

which is the result shown in Eq. (3) of the main text.
We note that the same result is obtained when one starts
the derivation at disc 2 instead of disc 1, which is also
evident from the symmetric form of the final expression.
As a last remark, we mention that this coupling may be
interpreted as

and

v(r1, r2) ≈ Qind(r1)Qind(r2)

(A15)
with the approximation Cd ≈ 8r0R, which simply cor-
responds to the product of the induced charges [Eq. (A1)]
divided by the total capacitance of the floating gate.

Appendix B: Schrieffer-Wolff transformation

In this appendix we provide the details of the SW
transformation that was performed in Sec. III of the main
text. We note that this transformation is often exploited
in the literature11,26,36 -- 38.

the center of the nearby disc), we thus assume that the
confining potential of the quantum dot is minimal at the
coordinates x = a0 = R and y = 0. Analogously, we
consider the DQD with the hybrid qubit to be located
below the edge of the other metallic disc. In our model,
the coordinates of the dot that contains two electrons
when the hybrid qubit is in the state 0(cid:105) are x = a0 = R
and y = 0. The coordinates of the second dot of the DQD
are x = a0 + l and y = 0. Thus, keeping in mind that
the origins of the coordinate systems for the LD and the
hybrid qubit are related to the respective metallic discs,
we find that a minimum of the confining potential occurs
at the position rmin = (a0, 0) = (R, 0) for both qubits.

As we are interested in the qubit-qubit coupling that
results from v(re, r1), we are looking for terms of type
xex1, xey1, yex1, or yey1 in the expansion. All the other
terms up to the second power in coordinates cannot lead
to a qubit-qubit interaction. Moreover, as the quantum

10

dots are displaced by a0 along the x axis only, we find

(cid:18) ∂Qind

∂y

(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)y=0

(C1)

Thus, the expansion up to the second power in coordi-
nates yields

v(re, r1) ≈ . . . + ηxex1,

rescaling terms that do not affect the qubit-qubit cou-
pling and

After such an expansion of all three terms v(re, r1),

20 We note that ellipsoidal coordinates found in the litera-
ture sometimes have different underlying definitions. De-
tails about the ξr used here are provided in Ref. 19.

21 Our formula differs from the one given in Ref. 11 by a

factor of 1/2. For the details see Appendix A

23 In a 2D parabolic potential with circular symmetry, there
are two degenerate orbital states that correspond to a first
excited state. We assume here that this degeneracy is lifted
and consider only one excited state, which is justified be-
cause asymmetries in the DQD potential can be generated

electrically with the gates that control the in-plane con-
finement.
