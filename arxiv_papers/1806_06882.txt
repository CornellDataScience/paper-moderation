We theoretically investigate coherent oscillations of the thermopower S as a function of the mag-
netic flux Φ in six-terminal Andreev interferometers. We demonstrate that the thermopower behav-
ior is determined by a number of contributions originating from the Josephson-like and Aharonov-
Bohm-like effects as well as from electron-hole asymmetry. The relative weight of these contributions
depends on the relation between temperature, voltage bias and an effective Thouless energy of our
setup. We particularly emphasize the role of the system topology that may have a dramatic impact
on the behavior of S(Φ).

INTRODUCTION

Long-range quantum coherence of electrons in normal-
superconducting (NS) hybrid nanostructures gives rise to
a large number of intriguing phenomena [1] which can be
directly observed at sufficiently low temperatures. A list
of such phenomena  --  by far incomplete  --  includes the
so-called π-junction state in SNS structures controlled
by driving electrons in the N-metal out of equilibrium
[2 -- 5], conductance reentrance [6, 7], proximity-induced
Aharonov-Bohm effect in mesoscopic SN-rings [6 -- 10],
non-local Andreev reflection [11 -- 17] and strongly en-
hanced thermoelectric effect due to spin-dependent elec-
tron scattering [18 -- 23] or Andreev reflection at differ-
ent NS-interfaces [24 -- 26]. The latter mechanism could
be responsible for large thermoelectric signal observed in
Andreev interferometers of different topology [27 -- 31].

Note that the thermopower detected in such interfer-
ometers exhibits coherent oscillations as a function of the
external magnetic flux Φ with the period equal to the
flux quantum Φ0 = π/e [32]. Depending on the sample
topology these oscillations can be described by either odd
or even functions of Φ [27]. Increasing an external bias
one could also observe these oscillations to vanish and
then re-appear with the phase shift equal to π [29]. In
our recent work [33] we offered an elaborate explanation
for these striking observations. In particular, we argued
that the low temperature behavior of Andreev interfer-
ometers is essentially determined by a trade-off between
non-equilibrium Josephson and Aharonov-Bohm effects
resulting in phase-coherent periodic oscillations of both
electric currents flowing between different terminals and
the thermopower as functions of the magnetic flux Φ.
While in general these oscillations were found to be nei-

ther even nor odd in Φ, they can reduce to both these
particular limits depending on the relation between ex-
ternal voltage bias eV and/or temperature T and the
characteristic Thouless energy of the device ETh to be
defined below. The physics of the π-shifted thermopower
oscillations observed in experiments [29] was found to be
similar to that elucidated before [2 -- 5] for the Josephson
π-junction state controlled by an external voltage bias V .
In this Letter we will further extend our analysis by
considering Andreev interferometers of a different topol-
ogy as compared to that addressed in [33], cf. Fig. 1.
We will explicitly evaluate the flux- or phase-dependent
thermopower and demonstrate that the system topology
 --  in addition to such parameters as eV , T and ETh  --  es-
sentially determines its thermoelectric properties in the
quantum limit.

THE MODEL AND BASIC FORMALISM

In what follows we will consider a multiterminal hybrid
structure schematically depicted in Fig. 1. This structure
consists of two superconducting and four normal termi-
nals interconnected by normal diffusive wires of equal
cross section A and different lengths as shown in Fig. 1.
The superconducting terminals S1 and S2 are described
by the complex order parameter ∆e±iφ/2, i.e. the phase
difference between them is set equal to φ. In practice,
this phase difference can be controlled, e.g., in a super-
conducting loop geometry encircling the magnetic flux
Φ, in which case one has φ = 2πΦ/Φ0. Two normal
terminals N1 and N2 are attached to the voltage source
V = V2 − V1, while two remaining terminals N3 and N4
are electrically isolated from any external circuit and are

kept at different temperatures T3 and T4. Accordingly,
the thermoelectric potentials V3 and V4 are generated at
these two normal terminals.
An important energy scale of our device is controlled
by the Thouless energy ETh = D/L2, where D is the wire
diffusion coefficient and L = lS,1 +lc +lS,2 is effective dis-
tance between the two superconducting terminals. Pro-
vided this distance strongly exceeds the superconducting
coherence length we have ETh (cid:28) ∆, i.e.
the relevant
energy scale in our problem stays well below the super-
conducting gap.

consisting of two superconducting and four normal terminals
interconnected by normal metallic wires of different lengths.

In order to proceed we will make use of the stan-
dard quasiclassical
formalism of the superconductiv-
ity theory [1]. Here we will adopt the standard θ-
parameterisation of the quasiclassical Green functions
[1, 34]

senting the retarded quasiclassical Green function, θ and

where fL(T )() is symmetric (antisymmetric) in energy

Note that the spectral function Y accounts for electron-
hole asymmetry in our system. At this point it is worth
mentioning here that generic metallic structures without
superconductors normally exhibit very weak thermoelec-
tric effect due to the presence of electron-hole symmetry
in such structures.

Eqs. (2) -- (5) need to be supplemented with proper
boundary conditions at all interfaces of our structure.
Here we will restrict our analysis to the important limit
of fully transparent metallic interfaces meaning that at all
wire nodes (i) the functions θ, χ, fL and fT remain con-
tinuous and (ii) the spectral currents A∇θ, A∇χ, AjL
and AjT are conserved. At the interfaces between the
wires and the N-terminals the functions θ, χ, fL and fT
take the bulk values deep inside the terminals. At NS
boundaries for  < ∆ we have jL = 0 and fT = 0 just
implying that (a) subgap quasiparticles transfer no heat
across the interface and (b) charge imbalance vanishes at
the NS boundary.

THERMOPOWER

The task at hand is to study the thermoelectic ef-
fect between the reservoirs N3 and N4. Let us set
lN,3 = lN,4 = lN .
In this case by symmetry we have
V3 = V4 = VN provided all terminals are kept at the
same temperature T . The potential VN just represents
the voltage drop at the point where the terminals N3 and
N4 are attached to the central wire lc.
In what follows we are going to evaluate the thermo-
electric potential difference V3 − V4. Let us define the
thermopower as

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)T4(cid:55)→T3

S34 =

V3 − V4
T3 − T4

.

(8)

We will demonstrate that this quantity obeys the follow-
ing general formula

S34(V, φ) = S0(V ) + Sodd(V, φ) + Seven(V, φ),

(9)
where S0(V ) = (cid:104)S34(cid:105)φ and the last two terms rep-
resent respectively odd and even in φ oscillating 2π-
periodic functions with zero average over φ. Hence, in the
agreement with our previous work [33] the thermopower
S34(V, φ) (9) is, in general, neither odd nor even function
of φ taking a nonzero value at φ = 0.
Making use of the formalism outlined in the previous
section we evaluated the thermopower S34(V, 0) numer-
ically as a function of temperature. The results of this
calculation are displayed in Fig. 2. We observe a rather
non-trivial non-monotonous behavior of the thermopower
as a function of T which  --  depending on the bias voltage
 --  can even change its sign. At high temperatures strongly
exceeding the Thouless energy ETh the thermopower S34
shows a slow (power-law) decay with increasing T which

is reminiscent of that for the even in φ (Aharonov-Bohm)
current component [7].

lS,2 = lN,1 = lN,2 = 1/3L, lc = 0.1L + (1/3 − 0.1)L, lN,3 =
lN,4 = 1/2L and ∆ = 103ETh.

Here VN is the induced voltage in both terminals N3 and
N4 for T3 = T4 = TN , i.e.
in the absence of the tem-
perature gradient. It is also important to keep in mind
that the spectral conductance GT (ε, φ) (GY (ε, φ)) in Eq.
(15) is an even (odd) function of both ε and φ.

Eq. (15) represents the cental result of this work.
The first observation to be made from this result is
that the thermoelectric effect vanishes in the symmetric
geometry with lS,1 = lS,2, lN,1 = lN,2 and with the ter-
minals N3 and N4 attached to the center. It is easy to see
that in this case we have VN = 0 and, hence, the even
term in Eq. (15) vanishes after the energy integration.
At the same time, the spectral function Y remains zero
in the wires lN,3,4, thus providing GY = 0.
that eVN <∼ ETh, the odd in φ contribution is dominant
(Note that eVN <∼ ETh does not

In addition, Eq. (15) implies that at low voltages, such

ETh, the even harmonics starts to dominate, cf. Fig. 3.
The latter observation is specific to our geometry, where
at such voltages the odd harmonics becomes suppressed
by the factor ∼ (lc,1 − lc,2)/L.

In Fig. 3 (left panel) we display the thermopower-phase
relations at T = ETh and for several voltage-bias values
V . We observe that, while at lower voltages the ther-
mopower S34(φ) is (almost) odd in φ, it then tends to an
even function of φ rather quickly with increasing V . It is
interesting to compare this behavior of the thermopower
with that of the phase-dependent current IS(φ) flowing
between the two superconducting terminals. The cur-
rent IS(φ) was recently evaluated elsewhere [35], and the
corresponding results are displayed in the right panel of
Fig. 3.

In contrast to the thermopower S34(φ), the odd in φ
harmonics dominates the function IS(φ) at all given val-
ues of the bias voltage V . This observation indicates that
the current IS(φ) and the thermopower S34(φ) may have
a different origin. Indeed, the current IS(φ) is defined
through the spectral supercurrent jE, while the odd har-
monics of S34(φ) originates from the spectral function Y.
To further stress the difference between these two quan-
tities, in Fig. 4 we plot the temperature dependence of
the odd harmonics for both the current and the ther-
mopower. We observe that at sufficiently high tempera-
tures T (cid:39) 15ETh the current amplitude is already com-
pletely suppressed, while the thermopower amplitude is
not.

FIG. 4: The principal odd Fourier harmonics of the
thermopower-phase
(solid lines) and the current-phase
(dashed lines) relations as functions of temperature for dif-
ferent bias voltages. The thermopower values are normalized
to 10−3/e, while the current IS is expressed in the same man-
ner as in Fig. 3. With increasing T the current amplitude
decays much faster as compared to that of S34.

Note that in our previous study [33] we addressed the
setup with a somewhat different topology from that ana-
lyzed here. In [33] we found that the thermopower-phase
relation closely follows the dependence IS(φ) at all values
of V . Furthermore, for V = 0 it was argued [25] that the
thermopower S is simply proportional to S ∝ dIS/dT .
Making use of this relation one could be tempted to spec-
ulate that both the supercurrent and the thermopower (i)
have the same origin and (ii) are odd functions of φ. The
results displayed in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate that the
relation S34 ∝ dIS/dT does not hold for Andreev inter-
ferometers under consideration.

Thus, the above analysis allows us to conclude that
the system topology  --  along with such parameters as V ,
T and ETh  --  plays a decisive role for the thermopower-
phase relation. This conclusion qualitatively agrees with
experimental observations [27]. Our results demonstrate
that  --  depending on the system topology  --  the behavior
of the thermopower can be diverse: In symmetric setups
it may get small or even vanish, while in non-symmetric
ones the origin of the odd-part of the thermopower-phase
relation may be determined either by the Josephson-like
effect or through the spectral function Y which accounts
for electron-hole asymmetry in our system.
