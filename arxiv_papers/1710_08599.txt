Abstract:  Ultrafast  electrically  driven  nanoscale  light  sources  are  critical  components  in 
nanophotonics.  Compound  semiconductor-based  light  sources  for  the  nanophotonic  platforms 
have  been  extensively  investigated  over  the  past  decades.  However,  monolithic  ultrafast  light 
sources  with  a  small  footprint  remain  a  challenge.  Here,  we  demonstrate  electrically  driven 
ultrafast graphene light emitters that achieve light pulse generation with up to 10 GHz bandwidth, 
across a broad spectral range from the visible to the near-infrared. The fast response results from 
ultrafast  charge  carrier  dynamics  in  graphene,  and  weak  electron-acoustic  phonon-mediated 
coupling between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. We also find that encapsulating 
graphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers strongly modifies the emission spectrum by 
changing the local optical density of states, thus providing up to 460 % enhancement compared 
to the grey-body thermal radiation for a broad peak centered at 720 nm. Furthermore, the hBN 
encapsulation  layers  permit  stable  and  bright  visible  thermal  radiation  with  electronic 
temperatures  up  to  2,000  K  under  ambient  conditions,  as  well  as  efficient  ultrafast  electronic 
cooling  via  near-field  coupling  to  hybrid  polaritonic  modes.  These  high-speed  graphene  light 
emitters provide a promising path for on-chip light sources for optical communications and other 
optoelectronic applications. 
  
 

 

Intense research over the past decades has focused on the development of high bandwidth 

photonics  for  inter-/intra-chip  connections  and  other  applications,  with  a  specific  aim  at 

nanophotonic  building  blocks  such  as  waveguides,  optical  modulators,  and  photodetectors. 

However, on-chip light sources, particularly monolithic nanoscale light sources with direct high-

speed  modulation,  have  remained  challenging  1.  Due  to  its  unique  electronic  and  optical 

properties,  graphene  has  emerged  as  a  promising  material  for  optoelectronic  applications, 

including as ultrafast and broadband photodetectors 2,3, optical modulators 4,5, plasmonics 6-8 and 

nonlinear photonic devices  9. Previous graphene devices have shown the feasibility of ultrafast 

signal  processing  and  frequency  conversion  functionalities  required  for  photonic  integrated 

circuits 9,10.  

Graphene's  high  thermal  stability,  low  heat  capacity,  and  ultrafast  opto-electronic 

properties 3,11 suggest that it could function as an unusual fast and efficient thermal light emitter. 

Early efforts showed infrared light emission from SiO2-supported graphene, with temperatures 

limited to ~ 1,100 K 12-14 due to dielectric degradation at high temperature 15 and significant hot 

carrier cooling to the substrate. We recently demonstrated thermal light emission in the visible 

range from electrically biased suspended graphene 16 which achieves temperature up to ~ 2,800 

K. However, to achieve rapid cooling required for fast modulation and to integrate such devices 

into photonic platforms, a substrate-supported device design is needed. Moreover, little is known 

about the possible modulation rate of graphene thermal emitters. 

Here, we demonstrate electrically driven ultrafast thermal light emitters based on hBN-

encapsulated  graphene.  The  hBN  allows  roughly  60%  larger  current  density  than  for  SiO2-

supported graphene due to its larger optical phonon energy  17 and, at the same time, provides 

excellent encapsulation. As a result, our devices achieve electron temperatures up to 2,000 K and 

produce  broadband  emission  extending  up  to  the  visible  range.  Our  studies  further  indicate 

device  lifetimes  of  years  in  vacuum  and  good  stability  even  under  ambient  conditions.  The 

thermal emission spectrum is strongly modified by the hBN dielectric optical cavity 5,18, which 

provides 460% enhancement for a broad peak centered at 720 nm compared to the grey-body 

thermal radiation. Analysis of thermal transport in the devices shows that the hBN effectively 

spreads heat over the micron scale, and that the dominant thermal transport pathway is vertical, 

with  good  agreement  between  models  and  the  measured  power  consumption  and  temperature 

profile.  Independent  measurements  of  electron  and  acoustic  phonon  temperatures  indicate  that 

the electrons can be ~30% hotter than the acoustic phonons at high bias due to weak electron-

acoustic  phonon  coupling  11,19.  Studies  of  the  light  emission  under  radiofrequency  and  pulsed 

excitation show continuous modulation at 3 GHz and emission pulses of 92 ps full width at half 

maximum (FWHM). This observation is consistent with a model in which electrons are strongly 

coupled to hybrid plasmon-phonon polaritonic modes at the graphene-hBN interface, but out of 

equilibrium with the acoustic phonons. 

To fabricate the graphene light emitters, hBN/graphene/hBN heterostructures were first 

assembled  by  a  van  der  Waals  dry  pick-up  method  using  exfoliated  monolayer  graphene  and 

exfoliated hBN flakes with 10-20 nm thickness and transferred to a SiO2 (285 nm)/Si substrate, 

as shown in Fig. 1A. Electrical contacts were formed by etching the assembled heterostructure 

and depositing metal (Cr/Pd/Au) on the exposed edge 20. The resulting graphene heterostructure 

exhibits mobility near the intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering limit at room temperature 20. The 

atomically clean interface reduces extrinsic effects  21,22 such as surface roughness, defects and 

charged impurities. This permits investigation of intrinsic electro-thermal properties, including 

thermal radiation, energy dissipation, and ultrafast dynamics of hot electrons in the disorder-free 

graphene system.  

Under high electric fields (F) up to ~ 6.6 V/µm and zero back gate voltage (VBG), these 

devices achieve current density (J) up to ~ 4.0 ´ 108 A/cm2. This high current density is due both 

to the high stability of the hBN and its high optical phonon energy, as will be explored further 

below. At high current density, we observe remarkably bright visible light emission from these 

micron-scale structures - even observable by the naked eye, as shown in Fig. 1C. The emission is 

seen across the channel region and increases in intensity with F as shown in Figs. 1D and 1E (see 

Supporting Information Movie Clips).  

Because  stability  is  essential  for  practical  applications,  we  tested  the  long-term 

performance  of  the  graphene  light  emitter  under  high  electric  field  (F  =  4.2  V/µm)  and  high 

current density (J ~ 3.4	×	10( A/cm2) under ~ 10-5 Torr vacuum. These measurements showed 

no significant degradation of emission intensity and electrical current over a test period of ~ 106 

seconds  as  shown  in  Fig.  1F,  suggesting  a  device  lifetime  (defined  by  50%  degradation  in 

current)  exceeding  4  years.  This  result  attests  to  the  remarkable  stability  of  both  the  hBN 

encapsulation  23,24  and  edge  contacts  even  under  high  electric  field,  current  density,  and 

temperature. Important for practical applications, we also observed visible light emission under 

ambient  conditions:  the  best  devices  showed  stable  operation  in  air  for  several  days,  and  it  is 

likely that improved encapsulation will extend this lifetime. 

Figure 2A shows the spectrum of the emitted light for a range of applied electric fields 

(or electric powers) under vacuum conditions. The spectrum extends from the visible to near-

infrared (400 ~ 1,600 nm), with an emission peak around 720 nm and a flat response in the near-

infrared  (>  1,000  nm)  from  several  graphene  light  emitters.  The  spectrum  is  unchanged  for 

emission  in  air  (Fig.  2B).    The  strong  emission  peak  at  720  nm  from  the  hBN  encapsulated 

graphene light emitter can be attributed to the formation of a dielectric optical cavity by the hBN 

layers (refractive index n = 2.2), and the resulting tailoring of thermal radiation by the modified 

local  optical  density  of  states  25.  The  intensity  of  thermal  radiation  from  graphene  at  a  given 

angle 𝜃,  defined  with  respect  to  the  normal  to  graphene  surface,  was  calculated  using  the 
generalized Kirchoff's law 26,  𝐼+,-𝜔,𝜃,𝑇0 =𝑎+,-𝜔,𝜃,𝑇0𝐼+,3𝜔,𝑇0, 
where	𝑎+,-𝜔,𝜃,𝑇0  is  a  spectral  directional  absorptivity  (emissivity)  of  the  graphene  layer  in 
the  stack  for  a  given  polarization  of  electromagnetic  wave 𝛼=𝑇𝐸,𝑇𝑀 , 𝜔  is  frequency, 
𝐼+,3𝜔,𝑇0 =𝜔7Θ(𝜔,𝑇0)/8𝜋>𝑐7 is the intensity of blackbody radiation for a single polarization, 
Θ𝜔 =ℏ𝜔/(exp	(ℏ𝜔/𝑘E𝑇0)−1), ℏ is  the  reduced  Planck's  constant,  kB  is  the  Boltzmann's 

constant,  and  Te  is  the  electron  temperature,  which  is  used  as  a  fitting  parameter.  The 

absorptivity  (emissivity)  of  the  graphene  was  calculated  analytically  by  solving  Maxwell's 

equations  for  a  plane  wave  incident  on  the  hBN/graphene/hBN  on  SiO2/Si  substrate.  This 

analysis reproduces the data well (solid lines in Fig. 2B) and implies Te = 1,980 K for F = 5.0 

V/µm.  The  radiation  enhancement  due  to  the  hBN  layers  reaches  460  %  at  the  720  nm  peak, 

relative  to  graphene  grey-body  thermal  radiation  at  same  Te  25  as  detailed  in  Supporting 

Information. We note that a flat response in the near-infrared (> 1,000 nm) is attributed to the 

Pauli  blocking  reduce  absorptivity  (emissivity)  of  graphene  at  high  Te  with  increased  Fermi 

energy.

Figure  2C  shows  that  the  derived  Te  increases  roughly  linearly  with  applied  electrical 

through the substrate rather than radiation. Consistent with this observation, dividing the total 

output optical power (Pr) across all wavelength based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law by 𝑃0, we 
find  an  radiation  efficiency 𝜂	~	3.45×10KL (see  Supporting  Information).  This  is  smaller  than 

obtained for suspended graphene, but can be improved by optical and thermal engineering. 

To gain insight into the thermal transport processes that determine the efficiency, lateral 

extent,  and  dynamics  of  the  light  emission,  we  measured  both  the  electronic  and  vibrational 

(acoustic phonon) temperature of the light emitters. To provide a second measurement of Te in 

addition  to  that  obtained  by  fitting  the  radiation  spectra  (Fig.  2B),  we  analyzed  the  high-bias 

electrical transport behavior. The I-V behavior for different values of the VBG (Fig. 3A) showed 

current  saturation  16,17,27  under  modest  electrical  fields  (F  >  0.5  V/µm)  for  VBG  >  20  V.  This 

saturation  can  be  attributed  to  efficient  backscattering  of  electrons  by  emission  of  strongly 

optical phonon energy) 28 becomes smaller than the acoustic phonon scattering length Lap, which 

coupled optical phonons when the optical phonon activation length 𝐿N(∝ℏ𝛺 𝐹, where ℏ𝛺 is the 
approaches 1	µm  in  a  hBN  encapsulated  graphene  at  room  temperature  20.  In  this  regime,  hot 
electrons in graphene can emit optical phonons in both the graphene and the hBN (ℏ𝛺 ~ 150-200 
meV). 𝐿N approaches 500 nm at F > 0.3-0.4 V/µm, consistent with the observed onset of current 
energy (ℏ𝛺RSTU ~ 60-80 meV), resulting in a lower current density (Figure S4). This highlights 

saturation. In SiO2–supported devices, hot electrons can emit SiO2 optical phonons with lower 

the importance of the hBN for achieving efficient visible light emission. Moreover, consistent 

with optical studies which show electron-optical phonon scattering on a sub-100 fs time scale3,

this  result  indicates  that    electrons  are  strongly  coupled  with  optical  phonon  modes  of  the 

We measured Te by plotting sheet conductance (𝜎) against VBG for different values of F 
(Fig. 3B). For F < 3.3 V/µm, 𝜎 is clearly modulated by VBG, while above 4 V/µm, 𝜎 is nearly 

independent  of  VBG.  This  reduction  in  gate  modulation  is  due  to  the  interplay  between 

electrostatically induced charge carriers 𝑛X∝𝑉EZ and thermally generated charge carriers, 𝑛[\∝
𝑇07  16,29,30.  Since 𝜎∝𝑛[][𝑒𝜇,  where 𝑛[][=𝑛[\+𝑛X  and 𝑒  is  the  electron  charge,  the  gate 
modulation  effect  becomes  small  when 𝑛[\  >> 𝑛X .  Using 𝜇∝𝑇0Ka  for  the  temperature-
dependent  mobility,  where 𝛽 =  2.5  is  obtained  from  a  numerical  self-consistent  heat  transport 

model,  and  using  Te  as  an  adjustable  parameter,  we  performed  numerical  calculations  of  the 

graphene self-heating that show good agreement with the measured data (Fig. 3B, solid lines) 

(see  Supporting  Information  for  details).  The  derived  values  of  Te  are  close  to  those  obtained 

from fitting the radiation spectrum (Fig. 2B). 

We  next  measured  Tap  of  graphene  and  hBN  by  Raman  spectroscopy:  the  graphene  G 

mode  and  the  hBN  E2g  mode  shift  downward  with  increasing  Tap  due  to  anharmonic  phonon 

coupling  31  (see  Supporting  Information  for  detail).  Figure  3C  shows  the  variation  of  these 

modes  up  to  F  =3.7  V/µm,  above  which  the  visible  radiation  background  interfered  with  the 

measurement. The derived temperatures, together with the electronic temperature derived above, 

are shown in Fig. 3D. Tap of the graphene and hBN are nearly equal, but fall below Te at high 

bias. Thus, these measurements indicate that Te is out of equilibrium with Tap due to the energy 

relaxation bottleneck, which has been seen to follow 𝑇0=𝑇cd+𝛼(𝑇cd−𝑇e), where 𝛼 is a non-
measured Te and Tap in the hBN encapsulated graphene heterostructure, we find 𝛼 ~ 0.45-0.77. 

equilibrium  temperature  coefficient  and  T0  is  the  ambient  temperature  16,29,30.  Based  on  the 

This  result  is  consistent  with  ultrafast  spectroscopic  studies  which  have  revealed  that  hot 

electrons  thermalize  rapidly  through  strong  electron-electron  and  electron-optical  phonon 

scattering  3,11,19,    but  more  slowly  with  acoustic  phonons  11,19,29.  In  addition,  previous 

measurements  have  indicated  that  electron  and  acoustic  phonon  temperatures  can  be  out  of 

equilibrium under high electrical bias 16,19.  However, given the uncertainty in calibration of the 

Raman shift rates with temperature and possible confounding effects such as substrate thermal 

expansion, this result alone is not sufficient to definitively establish the disequilibrium between 

Te and Tap. 

Because heat dissipation occurs primarily through transport of acoustic phonons, we used 

the measured lattice temperature (Tap ~ 1,250-1,450 K, which corresponds to Te ~ 2,000 K) to 

heat flow is dominated by vertical transport through the hBN and SiO2 to the Si substrate 32 (See

yields 𝑅[\ ~ 10,650-11,480 K/W, which matches reasonably well with a simple model in which

based on the non-equilibrium temperature coefficient 𝛼 and heat diffusion equation of Tap (see 

We  also  calculated  the  Te  distribution  in  the  hBN  encapsulated  graphene  light  emitter

Supporting Information). Combining the vertical thermal transport results above with the lateral 

thermal  conductivity  of  the  hBN  allows  calculation  of  the  lateral  thermal  diffusion  (healing) 

length (LH ~ 1.3 µm), which is similar to the observed size of the bright emission seen in Fig. 1E. 

Fig. 3E plots the resulting Te distribution along the graphene light emitter for various values of F. 

In  all  cases,  the  cooling  to  the  substrate  keeps  Te  near  the  metal  electrodes  below  ~  600  K, 

explaining  the  high  stability  of  the  devices.  The  expected  thermal  radiation  intensity  profile 

based on the modeled temperature distribution is shown in Fig. 3F, in good agreement with the 

measured  optical  intensity  profile  (Fig.  3F  inset,  and  Supporting  Information).  This  analysis 

suggests  how  to  optimize  the  device  design  by  thermal  engineering  of  the  vertical  thermal 

conductivity and lateral device dimensions.    

The small size and low heat capacity of the graphene emitter presents an opportunity for 

ultrafast  thermal  emission  modulation.  Moreover,  measurement  of  the  dynamics  of  light 

modulation  under  fast  pulses  may  provide  insight  into  the  carrier  dynamics  and  offer  another 

means to examine whether electron and phonon populations are out of equilibrium under high 

bias. Moreover, recent studies  33,34 also suggest that direct electronic cooling into hBN can be 

mediated by efficient near-field heat transfer due to the hybrid plasmon-phonon polaritonic mode 

at highly localized graphene/hBN interface 34. Therefore, we examined the ultrafast response of a 

device  fabricated  on  a  quartz  substrate,  which  reduces  parasitic  capacitance  and  enables 

electrical  driving  at  GHz  frequencies  with  DC  offset  bias  (VDC)  (Fig.  4)  (the  device  exhibits 

identical steady state radiation as observed above for the SiO2/Si substrate-mounted devices). As 

a first test, the emission time trace in Fig. 4B shows on-off modulation with near-perfect contrast 

when  device  is  driven  with  a  continuous  3  GHz  signal.  For  an  even  shorter  pulse  duration 

(FWHM 80 ps, peak to peak 2V with VDC =1.6V), the output light pulse width is only broadened 

to 92 ps (FWHM), which corresponding to above 10 GHz bandwidth as shown in Fig. 4C. This 

response is many orders of magnitude faster than conventional thermal radiation sources based 

on bulk materials, for which modulation speed has been limited to ~ 100 Hz 35.  

This observed ultrafast response may arise from the small size and thermal mass of the 

graphene,  since  vertical  thermal  diffusion  can  occur  over  sub-ns  timescales  for  nm-scale 

structures.  More  intriguingly,  if  electrons  are  out  of  equilibrium  with  the  acoustic  phonons  as 

indicated in Fig. 3, this high speed may be due to ultrafast cooling from Te to Tap, which should 

be sufficient to modulate the output intensity by direct electronic cooling mediated with near-

field heat transfer via hybrid plasmon-phonon polaritonic mode at graphene/hBN interfaces.  

The simple heat transfer model shown in the inset of Fig. 4C allows us to quantify the 

transient cooling behavior. In this model, we assume that the hot graphene electrons are strongly 

coupled to and in equilibrium with the optical phonons of graphene and the top few layers of the 

temperature (Te ~ 2,000 K, Tap ~ 1,000-1,280 K) under steady state measurements shown in Fig. 

hBN  19,34.  These  optical  phonons  are  connected  to  the  acoustic  phonon  bath  by  thermal 

conductance   𝛤h    and  to  the  environment  by 𝛤e  36. 𝛤h  can  be  derived  from  non-equilibrium 
3D:  𝑇0−𝑇cd≈𝑃/𝛤h	36, with 𝛤h  ~	6.0−8.4	MWm-2K-1, which is consistent with theory 37. The 
fast cooling time constants (𝜏l) of graphene light emitter was estimated by fitting based on the 
𝐼∝exp	[−ℏ𝜔d0cn/𝑘E(𝑇e+𝑑𝑇𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑡/𝜏l)], where ℏ𝜔d0cn is the maximum spectral sensitivity 
of avalanche photodetector (corresponding to the 550 nm),  𝑇e is offset temperature controlled by 
DC  offset  bias,  and 𝑑𝑇 is  modulated  temperature  by  RF  pulses.  Based  on  the  fitting  of  time-
resolved light pulse output from graphene with 𝑇e (300-700 K) and 𝑑𝑇 (20-200 k) parameters, 
we  obtained 𝜏l~  120-900  ps  (see  Supporting  Information).  Estimated 𝜏l allow  us  to  determine 
the heat capacity of the electron/optical phonon system, 𝐶u=𝜏l𝛤h = 0.72−6.63	×	10K>	Jm-2K-

1. This value is 104 times larger than the electronic heat capacity of graphene (see Supporting 

Information),  confirming  the  assumption  that  optical  phonons  are  in  equilibrium  with  the 

electrons. We find that the magnitude of CT corresponds to the optical phonons in graphene in 

addition  to  0.3-3.6  nm  of  the  surrounding  hBN  38,39.  This  view  is  consistent  with  theoretical 

predictions for hybrid modes that are highly localized at the graphene-hBN interface 33,34. 

This  work  establishes  that  hBN-encapsulated  graphene  provides  visible  light  emission 

with  high  stability  and  a  modulation  rate  speed  several  orders  of  magnitude  faster  than 

conventional thermal emitters. Our quantitative model predicts that the exceptional speed likely 

arises  because  hot  electrons  are  strongly  coupled  to  optical  phonons  and  hybrid  plasmon-

hyperbolic phonon polariton modes in hBN, but weakly coupled to acoustic phonons, resulting in 

disequilibrium  between  the  two  populations,  though  the  dynamics  of  this  process  need  to  be 

studied in more detail. We found that the emission spectrum is strongly modified by a tailored 

density of optical modes in the hBN slab; this modification may be engineered to sharply reshape 

the  emission  spectrum  by  coupling  the  hBN  encapsulated  graphene  to  an  optical  cavity. 

Furthermore, making use of a tunable energy relaxation pathway for the graphene light emitter, 

such as tunneling structures 40, could allow an even faster light modulation rate beyond the speed 

limits  explored  here.  Finally,  we  note  that  graphene  thermal  emitters  employ  the  same  basic 

device  architecture  as  demonstrated  previously  for  ultrafast  photodetectors  and  electro-optic 

modulators  2,5,8.  Thus,  one  graphene-hBN  heterostructure  device  could  serve  three  essential 

electro-optic  device  functions,  which  could  enable  flexible  and  reconfigurable  electro-optic 

applications in future photonic system architectures.

Fig. 1. Ultrafast hBN encapsulated graphene thermal light emitter. (A) The device consists 
of a monolayer graphene encapsulated on top and bottom by hBN; it has a one-dimensional edge 
contact to the drain and source contact (see inset). (B) Current density (J) as a function of applied 
electric field (F) for an emitter with channel length of 5 µm and width of 3 µm (see inset with 
scale bar of 6 µm).  (C) Optical images show bright visible light emission from a microscale (3 
µm - 8 µm) individual graphene light emitter under applied electric field (F = 6 V/µm). (D to E) 
The graphene surface uniformly emits across the entire graphene/hBN heterostructures (3 µm – 6 
µm) (D) and radiation intensity increase by the applied electric field (E). (Scale bar of 6 µm). (F) 
Long-term stability of graphene light emitter under vacuum. The current density (J) of graphene 
light emitter under constant electric field (F = 4.2 V/µm) was measured during 106 seconds (over 
270  hours),  showing  negligible  variation  in  current  density  and  light  emission  intensity.  Inset 
shows the optical images. (Scale bar of 6 µm).

range for high F values. Inset shows the optical image of visible light emission under F = 5.0 
V/µm. (Scale bar is 6 µm). (B) Measured radiation spectrum of graphene light emitter (scatter)
