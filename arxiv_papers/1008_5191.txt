We present exact formulas for the entanglement and R´enyi entropies generated at a quantum
point contact (QPC) in terms of the statistics of charge fluctuations, which we illustrate with
examples from both equilibrium and non-equilibrium transport. The formulas are also applicable to
groundstate entanglement in systems described by non-interacting fermions in any dimension, which
in one dimension includes the critical spin-1/2 XX and Ising models where conformal field theory
predictions for the entanglement and R´enyi entropies are reproduced from the full counting statistics.
These results may play a crucial role in the experimental detection of many-body entanglement in
mesoscopic structures and cold atoms in optical lattices.

Introduction. --  Entanglement entropy is playing an in-
creasingly important role in describing quantum corre-
lations in many-body systems [1]. For a bipartite sys-
tem, Fig. 1a, the entanglement entropy of subsystem
A is defined as SA = −TrA{ ρA log ρA}, where the re-
duced density matrix ρA = TrB{ ρ} is obtained from the
full density matrix ρ by tracing out the degrees of free-
dom in the remainder B. For a pure state ρ = ΨihΨ,
SA = SB ≡ S. Entanglement entropy is currently being
studied theoretically in a wide range of systems includ-
ing quantum critical systems in one [2 -- 4] and higher [5]
dimensions, topologically-ordered states [6], and evolu-
tion after a quench [7]. Experimental progress, however,
has so far been hindered by the difficulty of measuring
the density matrix of a quantum many-body system and
the fact that the definition of entanglement entropy itself
does not refer to any directly measurable observables.

There has thus been a growing interest in relating en-
tanglement entropy to experimentally accessible quanti-
ties, in particular fluctuations of charge and magnetiza-
tion [8]. An important step towards this goal was taken
by Klich and Levitov who suggested an intimate con-
nection between entanglement entropy and current fluc-
tuations for non-interacting fermions [9]. They studied
the entanglement entropy between two electronic leads
connected via a quantum point contact (QPC), Fig. 1b,
and found that it can be expressed as a series in the
cumulants of the current fluctuations. Remarkably, for
purely gaussian fluctuations with variance C2 their result
S = (π2/3)C2 = (1/3) log(T /τ ) reproduces the confor-
mal field theory (CFT) prediction S = (c/3) log(L/ξ)
with the spatial extent L replaced by the temporal win-
dow T during which the QPC is open, the spatial cut-off
ξ replaced by the short-time cut-off τ , and the central
charge equal to unity c = 1 [2, 10, 11].

However, the series developed in Ref. 9 does not con-
verge in general for non-gaussian fluctuations [12]. This
constitutes a major obstacle to further systematic study

of entanglement and its relation to fluctuations in many-
body systems. To illustrate the acuteness of this prob-
lem, consider the simplest situation involving a QPC
where only a single charge is transmitted with probability
1/2: The series in Ref. 9 expresses the entanglement en-
tropy as an infinite sum over charge cumulants Cn, where
the coefficients for high-order cumulants asymptotically
go to a constant (∼ 2Cn for large orders n). A quick
calculation shows that for this simple process the Cn di-
verge as Cn ∼ 2(n−1)!/πn, and indeed such factorial di-
vergences are quite typical for non-gaussian distributions
[13]. Experimental determination of the entanglement
entropy from the cumulants using the results of Ref. 9
therefore requires further resummation.

In this Letter we present exact and convergent series
for the entanglement and R´enyi entropies. The formu-
las are applicable to a large class of many-body systems,
which we illustrate with examples of entanglement gener-
ation in a QPC, Fig. 1b, and groundstate entanglement of
systems described by non-interacting fermions in one and

two dimensions. In one dimension the latter includes the
equivalent, and experimentally relevant, case of strongly-
repulsive bosons in an optical lattice, Fig. 1c, as well as
the spin-1/2 XX and Ising models. Our formulas pave the
way to an improved understanding of fluctuations and
entanglement in quantum many-body systems and may
facilitate experimental investigations of entanglement en-
tropy in mesoscopic structures where the measurement of
high-order current correlators is becoming possible [14].
Main result. --  We begin by considering the QPC de-
picted in Fig. 1b, but we will see below that the result
applies to a much larger class of problems. Charge fluc-
tuations in one of the leads of the QPC (the right lead,
for concreteness) are characterized by the probability Pn
of transmitting n charges from the left to the right lead.
The main result of this work relates the entanglement
entropy to the charge statistics as

where S1(n, m) are the unsigned Stirling numbers of the
first kind. A beautiful property of the series (1) is that
only even-order cumulants contribute, reflecting the re-
quirement that the entanglement entropy be symmetric
between the left and right leads in the particular case
of a pure state: Since charge conservation implies that
the number of electrons n collected in the right lead is
equal to −n charges collected in the left, only even-order
cumulants are symmetric in the two leads. Moreover,
αn(∞) = 2ζ(n) for even n where ζ(n) is the Riemann
zeta function, and in particular we reproduce the CFT re-
sult S = (π2/3)C2 for purely gaussian fluctuations where
all cumulants except the first and second are zero. In gen-
eral, however, the number of cumulants included fixes the
cutoff K. As K grows the series becomes an increasingly
sharper estimate of S from below. This feature of the
series is important from a practical point of view, since
it ensures that including more terms always improves the
estimate, e.g. Figs. 2 and 3.

Derivation. --  To derive Eq. (1) we begin with the ex-

pression for the entanglement entropy

S = −Tr {M log M + (1 − M ) log(1 − M )},

(3)

where M = PRnU PR is the correlation matrix projected
onto the modes in the right lead by PR, and we assume
that M is either finite or can be regularized such that
the operations below are well-defined [15]. Here n is

2

the Fermi-Dirac distribution before the evolution, and
nU = U nU † represents the state of the total system af-
ter evolution U of the single particle modes. We first
expand the logarithms in Eq. (3) around M = 0, 1 to

obtain S =P∞

n=1 An/n with

An = Tr {M (1 − M )n + M n(1 − M )}.

(4)

To relate the coefficients An to measurable quantities, we
next use the Levitov -- Lesovik determinant formula [16]
for the generating function of the charge transport statis-
tics written as

χ(λ) = det[(1 − M + M eiλ)e−iλUnPR U †

].

Convergence. --  The convergence of the series (1) for
any M is most conveniently shown with the equivalent
form (6). The counting statistics for non-interacting
electron transport through a two-terminal conductor is
always generalized binomial [17], such that the gener-
ating function can be factored into a product of bino-
mial events with individual probabilities 0 ≤ pi ≤ 1.
This is equivalent to evaluating Eq. (4) in the eigen-
basis of M . Then S = Pi H2(pi), where H2(x) =
−x log x − (1 − x) log(1 − x) is the binary entropy func-
tion. Since M is assumed to be finite and H2(x) has the
convergent (absolutely, by the ratio test) series expansion
i (1 − pi)], the
series (6) also converges to the correct value. Moreover,
since each term An/n is positive and decreasing for in-
creasing n, Eq. (6) yields an increasingly sharper lower
bound to the exact entanglement entropy. The same con-
clusion holds for the series expressed in terms of ordinary
cumulants, i.e., as the cutoff K is increased the sum (1)
converges from below to the exact entanglement entropy.
The rate of convergence generally depends on the dis-
tribution of eigenvalues pi; specifically, the expansion of
the logarithms in Eq. (3) implies that the presence of
eigenvalues of M near 0 or 1 will slow the rate of con-
vergence. As shown below, typically the first few terms
dominate the series, but full convergence may require the
inclusion of many terms.

cluded, from bottom to top, is indicated in each plot.

R´enyi entropies. --  Before turning to applications of
Eq. (1), we briefly show that the same approach can
also be used to compute the R´enyi entropies Sn ≡
(1 − n)−1 log[Tr { ρn
R}] of order n > 1, which can be
written as Sn = (1 − n)−1Tr {log[M n + (1 − M )n]}.
From a similar derivation to Eq. (1) we obtain Sn =

Once again only even cumulants contribute to the sum.
Moreover, for the gaussian case where all but the first and
second cumulants vanish it can be shown that β2(n,∞) =
(π2/6)(1 + 1/n), which correctly reproduces the CFT re-
sult for the R´enyi entropies [18].

While we have expressed the entanglement and R´enyi
entropies in terms of the cumulants of the current with
experimental applications in mind, it is also useful to ex-
press the entropies in terms of the cumulant generating
function itself. This can be done by relating both the
R´enyi entropies and the generating function to the spec-
tral density µ(z) = Tr δ(z − M ) of M to obtain

By numerically integrating these expressions we can
benchmark Eq. (1) against the exact results when only a
finite number of cumulants are included, Fig. 2.

Entanglement production in a QPC. --  As our first ap-
plication of Eq. (1) we consider the generation of entan-
glement due to current fluctuations in a QPC. For the

3

equilibrium setup at zero bias and transmission D, the
generating function is given by [19]

χ(λ) = e−λ2

∗G/(2π2),

(10)

with G = log{[hβ/(πτ )] sinh[πt/(hβ)]}, where t is the
time during which the QPC is open, τ a short-time cut-
off, and β = 1/(kBT ) the inverse temperature. Here h
and kB are the Planck and Boltzmann constants, respec-
tively. For imperfect transmission D < 1, the generat-
ing function (10) possesses cumulants of all (even) or-
ders, while for D = 1 the statistics is gaussian. At short
times τ ≪ t ≪ hβ the growth of entanglement entropy
is logarithmic, while at long times t ≫ hβ the growth
is linear. Thus at any non-zero temperature the entan-
glement production rate eventually becomes constant.
If a DC voltage bias V is applied, the non-equilibrium
generating function at zero temperature (the quantum
shot noise regime) is found to be the binomial distribu-
tion log χ(λ) = (eV t/h) log(1 − D + Deiλ), for which
S = −(eV t/h)[D log D + (1 − D) log(1 − D)] [9]. This
is also the electron-hole entanglement predicted for a bi-
ased tunnel junction [20], and indeed in both cases the
R´enyi entropies for small D are Sn ≃ [n/(n−1)]N , where
N = (eV t/h)D is the number of transferred particles [21].
The dependence of the entanglement entropy on the
transmission D in the two cases is shown in Fig. 2. We
see that the first few cumulants give a good approxima-
tion to the exact result obtained from Eq. (9), especially
for the case of a bias voltage. This indicates that the
detection of entanglement generation in a QPC may be
within experimental reach using currently available noise
measurement techniques [14].

Groundstate entanglement in the XY model. --  We next
consider a very different setup from the QPC, namely
the bipartite entanglement entropy of the groundstates
of systems described by free fermions, such as the spin-
1/2 XY model in one dimension with Hamiltonian

H = JXi

[(1+γ) Sx

This Hamiltonian is equivalent to a problem of free spin-
less fermions through the Jordan-Wigner transformation
[22] and for γ = 0 also describes bosons in a one-
dimensional lattice with infinite on-site repulsion, Fig.
1c. Here we are concerned with relating the entangle-
ment entropy to the fluctuations as a function of subsys-
tem size ℓ. The central quantity is M = (1 + √GT G)/2,
where Gij = h(a†
j + aj)i with the indices i, j
restricted to the first ℓ sites of the chain and ai is the
Jordan-Wigner fermion annihilation operator on site i.
The entanglement entropy is then given by Eq. (3) [3],
while the corresponding generating function is χ(λ, ℓ) =
det(1 − M + M eiλ) up to an irrelevant phase. For the
XX model at γ = 0 the generating function describes

tuations must be interpreted as those of quasi-particles,
since total Sz is not a conserved quantity. The results
for both the critical XX model at zero magnetic field
(γ = 0, b = 0) and critical Ising model (γ = 1, b = J)
with periodic boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 3a.
Remarkably, the cumulants correctly reproduce the two
central charges c = 1 and c = 1/2 for the XX and Ising
models, respectively [3]. We also note that the random
singlet phase [4] can be studied with this method by ran-
domly varying J and b across different sites.

More generally, the same formalism is applicable to
any quadratic fermionic Hamiltonian, regardless of di-
mension, and as such can also be used to determine the
entanglement entropy from the fluctuations in higher di-
mensions. On the L× L square lattice in two dimensions
with nearest-neighbor hopping, for example, we find that
the approximation by cumulants follows the predicted
S ∼ L log L scaling [23] as shown in Fig. 3b with the
subsystem taken to be half the lattice.

Conclusions. --  We have derived exact formulas for the
entanglement and R´enyi entropies in terms of the statis-

4

tics of charge fluctuations. The expressions are applicable
to a wide range of experimentally relevant many-body
systems, for example entanglement produced in QPCs
and groundstate entanglement of systems described by
non-interacting fermions (or quasi-particles) in any di-
mension.
