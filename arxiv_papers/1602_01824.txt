Abstract

Employing density functional theory-based methods, we investigate monolayer and bilayer struc-

tures of hexagonal SnS2, which is recently synthesized monolayer metal dichalcogenide. Compari-

son of 1H and 1T phases of monolayer SnS2 confirms the ground state to be the 1T phase. In its

bilayer structure we examine different stacking configurations of the two layers. It is found that

the interlayer coupling in bilayer SnS2 is weaker than that of typical transition-metal dichalco-

genides (TMDs) so that alternative stacking orders have similar structural parameters and they

are separated with low energy barriers. Possible signature of the stacking order in SnS2 bilayer

has been sought in the calculated absorbance and reflectivity spectra. We also study the effects of

the external electric field, charging, and loading pressure on the characteristic properties of bilayer

SnS2. It is found that (i) the electric field increases the coupling between the layers at its prefered

stacking order, so the barrier height increases, (ii) the bang gap value can be tuned by the external

E-field and under sufficient E-field, the bilayer SnS2 can become semi-metal, (iii) the most favorable

stacking order can be switched by charging and (iv) a loading pressure exceeding 3 GPa changes

the stacking order. E-field tunable bandgap and easy-tunable stacking sequence of SnS2 layers

make this 2D crystal structure a good candidate for field effect transistor and nanoscale lubricant

applications.

INTRODUCTION

Ultrathin materials,1 the study of which was boosted after the synthesis of graphene,2

have attracted considerable interest due to their remarkable physical properties.3,4 Graphene

has extraordinary mechanical5 and optical6 properties. However, due to the lack of a band

gap in graphene,7 exploring other two-dimensional (2D) materials with a band gap be-

came important for several applications. In this respect, synthesis and theoretical predic-

tion of many other 2D materials have been achieved, such as silicene,8,9 germanene,8,10 -- 12

stanene,13,14 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),15 -- 22 and hexagonal structures of III-V

binary compounds (e.g. h-BN, h-AlN).23 -- 27 The atomic scale of thickness of these materials

led to new physical insights which suggests that possible other 2D materials may exhibit

novel properties. In addition, the need for a wide range of materials for device technology

makes the discovery of new layered materials essential.

In regard to search for new graphene-like or TMD-like 2D material, Sn-dichalcogenides are

good candidate because of their vdW-linked lamellar crystal structure and energy bandgap

which is in the visible frequency region. As a member of this family, tin disulfide (SnS2) was

previously investigated in the bulk form for various applications.28 -- 34 After the emergence

of novel 2D materials and improved production methods such as chemical vapor deposition,

chemical and mechanical exfoliation, thinner structures of SnS2 were synthesized for different

applications. For example, a few nanometer-thick hexagonal SnS2 was used for lithium

storage in battery applications.35 -- 38 To enhance the electrochemical performance, composite

forms of SnS2 with graphene were examined.39 -- 43 Single- and few-layer SnS2 were also used to

fabricate a field-effect transistor.44 -- 46 Moreover, photocatalytic character of single- and few-

layer SnS2 was shown in different studies which is directly related to the optical properties

of hexagonal SnS2.47 -- 50 Furthermore, SnS2 nanosheet was studied for photosensitive field

emission and photodetector applications.51,52

Recently, Zhang et al. demonstrated that photoluminescence spectrum of SnS2 and MoS2

show additional features when they form a van der Waals heterostructure which is important

for the engineering of their electronic and optical properties.53 Huang et al. investigated the

synthesis, characterization and the electronic properties of SnS2, from bulk to monolayer.54

More recently, Su et al. reported that hexagonal SnS2 is a suitable material for photodetec-

tion applications with fast photocurrent response time ∼5 µs.55 In addition to these, Ahn

3

et al. successfully synthesized hexagonal SnS2 and orthorhombic SnS as a polymorphic 2D

heterostructure.56

Although there are a few number of computational works on single layer hexagonal

SnS2,57,58 comprehensive investigation of electronic and optical properties of it's monolayer

and bilayer crystal structures are still lacking. Therefore, in this study we concentrate on

the monolayer and bilayer forms of hexagonal SnS2. The structural parameters, electronic

properties and optical response of these materials are investigated using ab initio methods.

In addition, from the calculated absorbance or reflectivity spectra, the optical signatures

which allows one to characterize the structural phase or the stacking order of the SnS2 lay-

ers were sought. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of an applied perpendicular electric

field, charging, and loading pressure on the characteristic properties of bilayer SnS2.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we give details of our computational method-

ology. An overview of the structural phases, the electronic and optical properties of mono-

layer hexagonal SnS2 are presented in Sec. III. In Sec. IV different stacking orders of bilayer

SnS2 in the T-phase are investigated in detail. The effect of the external electric field,

charging, and loading pressure on the bilayer system are studied. Finally, we present our

conclusion in Sec. V.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY

Our investigations of the structural, electronic and optical properties for the layered

SnS2 were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package, VASP59 -- 61 which is

based on density functional theory (DFT). The VASP code solves the Kohn-Sham equa-

tions for a system with periodic boundary conditions using iteratively a plane-wave basis

set. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the generalized gradient approximation

(GGA)62 was adopted to describe electron exchange and correlation. The hybrid DFT-

HSE06 functional63 on top of GGA was used for a more accurate estimation of the band

gap, as compared to GGA which usually underestimates the band gap of semiconducting

systems. The spin-orbit interaction, which is essential for the TMDs, was included in the

calculations. The interlayer interaction is dominated by the vdW forces for such layered

materials, which was taken into account by using the DFT-D2 method of Grimme.64,65 To

obtain the charge distribution of the configuration, a Bader charge analysis is used.66,67

4

Structural optimizations were performed with the following parameters. The kinetic

energy cut-off of the plane-wave basis set was 500 eV in all calculations. The total energy

difference between the sequential steps in the iterations was taken 10−5 units as convergence

criterion. The convergence for the Hellmann-Feynman forces on each atom was taken to
be 10−4 eV/A. Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV was used and the pressures on the unit cell

were decreased to a value less then 1.0 kB in all three directions. For the determination

of accurate charge densities, Brillouin zone integration was performed using a 35 × 35 × 1

Γ-centered mesh for the primitive unit cell. To avoid interactions between adjacent SnS2

monolayers and few layer systems, our calculations were performed with a large unit cell
including 16 A vacuum space.

In addition, the absorbance and the reflectivity of the previously optimized structures

was investigated with and without spin-orbit interaction and also including HSE06 on top

of GGA. A Γ-centered k-point sampling of 70 × 70 × 1 was used for monolayer systems.

Because of the computational burden, k-point sampling was reduced to 35 × 35 × 1 for the

bilayer systems, and 21×21×1 for the calculations that include the HSE06 hybrid functional

and spin-orbit interaction. The calculated dielectric function provides us with the optical

quantities such as the frequency dependent absorbance A(ω) and the Fresnel reflectivity

R(ω) through the formulas;

III. H AND T PHASES OF SINGLE LAYER SNS2

Monolayer SnS2 possesses two different phases 1T and 1H as shown in Fig. 1. Both phases

have three trigonal subplanes where the Sn subplane is sandwiched by two S-subplanes. The

1T phase is a member of the P 3m2 space group where subplanes of it are ABC stacked.

The 1H is a member of the P 6m2 space group where subplanes of it are ABA stacked. The

We obtained the lattice constants of 3.68 A and 3.60 A for 1T and 1H, respectively. The
corresponding Sn-S bond lengths (dSn−S) are 2.59 A and 2.63 A which are given in Table
I. The energy difference between the 1T and 1H phases is 875 meV per unit cell which

shows that the formation of the 1H phase is less favorable than 1T. The cohesive energies

of 1T and 1H phases are 3.79 eV and 3.49 eV, respectively. These results are consistent

with the previous results which find the 1T phase the most favorable form of the monolayer.

In addition, the work functions (Φ) of the phases are 7.54 eV and 6.19 eV. These work

function values are larger than those of graphene and bilayer graphene (∼4.6 and ∼4.7

eV,68 respectively) and of single- and few-layer MoS2 (∼5.4 eV).69

Band structures of 1T and 1H phases based on GGA including spin-orbit coupling (SOC)

and HSE06 hybrid functional are given in Fig. 1. The 1T phase of SnS2 monolayer has an

indirect band gap where the valance band maximum (VBM) is between the Γ and M points

and the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the M point. As given in Table I, the band

gap of 1T phase is 1.58 eV within GGA+SOC and 2.40 eV within GGA+HSE06. 0.7 e− is

donated to each S atom by Sn atom. The 1H phase also has an indirect band gap where the

VBM is at Γ point and the CBM is at M point. The band gap values are 0.78 eV within

GGA+SOC and 1.58 eV within GGA+HSE06.

The effect of the SOC is evident in both the 1T and 1H structures, as shown in Figs. 1

(c) and (d). In the 1T structure, the splitting is ∼50 meV at the highest VB states at the

Γ point while in the 1H structure the splittings are ∼69 meV in the highest VB states at

the Γ point and ∼43 meV in the lowest CB states at the K point. These splittings can be

exploited in 'valleytronics' applications where the excitations of the electrons with different

spin are controlled by the polarization of the incident light. This was recently demonstrated

for the TMDs, especially for MoS2.70,71

The absorbances and the reflectivities of monolayer SnS2 are also calculated and the

energy dependent plots are given in Figs. 1 (e) and (f), respectively. The absorbance plot

shows that the 1T and 1H phases have different characters. For the 1T phase, absorbance

7

(black) starts at ∼1.8 eV, and at around 4 eV a peak is found. It has also a local maximum

at around 4.5 eV. On the other hand, for the 1H phase the absorbance (red) starts at ∼1.7

eV and it shows its main peak around 3.2 eV, a local maximum around 4.8 eV. Since the

absorbance spectra of the alternative phases are quite distinguishable, optical absorbance

measurements can be a reliable tool for determining the structural phase of monolayer SnS2

samples.

IV. BILAYER SNS2

Determining or controlling the stacking order of a layered material is important for elec-

tronic and optical applications. They can modify the electronic and the optical properties

even if the layers are weakly interacting as in van der Waals layered materials. Improvements

in synthesis techniques allows researchers to control the stacking order of multilayer struc-

tures and synthesis of devices with desired features. Therefore, in this section we investigate

properties of bilayer SnS2 starting with the analysis of possible stacking orders.

In Fig. 2, bilayer structures with three different stacking types, their corresponding band

diagrams, and the imaginary part of the dielectric functions are given. In the monolayer

section, the 1T phase was found to be energetically favorable, and therefore we restrict

ourselves to 1T phase. AA (Sn atoms are aligned on Sn atoms), AB (S atoms are aligned on

Sn atoms) and A′B (similar with AB but the bottom layer is upside-down) are considered.

Also the AA′ stacking (not shown) where the S atoms are aligned on S is examined, but its

total energy is considerably larger as compared to the given three other stacking types. A

few meV energy difference was found between the AA, A′B, and AB stacking orders which

are given in Table II where we have set the minimum energy to 0. All types have the same
lattice constant of 3.68 A. The interlayer distances are 2.95 A, 2.97 A, and 3.03 A for the

AA, A′B, and AB stacking orders, respectively.

The cohesive energy of bilayer SnS2 in all stacking orders are the same, 3.81 eV which is

9

slightly higher than the monolayer 1T phase. The work functions are also similar where the

values are 6.50 eV, 6.50 eV and 6.58 eV for the AA, A′B, and AB, respectively. The work

function of the bilayer is smaller than that of the 1T monolayer which is in contrast with what

was found for graphene and MoS2.68,69 Another point is that the interlayer potential energy

per SnS2 for the different stacking types are also very close to each other; 38 meV, 38 meV,

and 35 meV for AA, A′B, and AB, respectively. This weak interaction is a characteristic

feature of van Waals layered materials, yet these energy values are smaller as compared to

graphite (30-55 meV per atom)72,73 and typical TMDs (74, 107, 90, 126 meV per MX2 for

MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, respectively).74

FIG. 3: (Color online) Left panel, blue (red) curve indicates the energy difference when the top

layer is sliding along the armchair (zig-zag) direction. Right panel, the structural forms of the

extremas marked on the energy profiles are given.

In spite of the weak interlayer interactions, and the similarities of the structural param-

eters, the AA, AB and A′B stacking types possess different band dispersions and band

gaps. Although the VBM and the CBM are at the same symmetry points for all stacking

orders, the values of the indirect band gaps are different. For AA, which is energetically

the favorable one, we have 1.53 eV band gap within GGA and 2.34 eV within HSE06. The

band gaps in the A′B and the AB stackings are 1.47 and 1.37 eV within GGA and 2.27

and 2.17 eV within HSE06, respectively. It must be emphasized that the band dispersions

arising from each bilayer configuration differ especially at the symmetry points M and K

which are important for the optical transitions and the excitonic states. For AA stacking,

10

the two CB edge states at the M point are very close to each other as compared to those of

A′B and AB. On the other hand, the two CB edge states at the K point are significantly

different in energy as compared to those of A′B and AB. The absorbance spectrum of the

bilayer systems are given in Figs. 2 (g) and (h). The general trend of the absorbances for

all bilayers are similar. Inset of Fig. 2 (g)is a zoom at the onset region of the absorbance

spectrum. Despite the weak interactions given in Table II, the absorbance spectra provide

information on the stacking.

In addition, the main peak around 4 eV of the AA stack-

ing displays two distinct peaks while A′B and AB have only one peak. Hence, the simple

absorbance spectrum carries structural signatures although the structures are energetically

very similar.

The weak layer-layer interaction in bilayer SnS2 is also promising for barrierless sliding

applications. The sliding potential in the armchair and the zig-zag directions are given in

Fig. 3. The local and global extrema and the corresponding structural forms are shown.

The positions of the upper S atoms of the bottom layer and lower S atoms of the top layer

are responsible for the potential profile. In the case of sliding along the armchair direction

the local maximum is seen when the lower S atoms of the top layer are positioned at the

mid point of the upper S atoms of the bottom layer. This is followed by a local minimum

that corresponds to AB stacking. The highest point of the barrier is ∼ 65 meV. This point

is also global maximum where the S atoms from top and bottom layer are aligned on top of

each other. This energy barrier is very small as compared to that of MoS2 (∼ 200 meV).75

In the zig-zag direction, the barrier profile results in a symmetric peak with the highest

point obtained when the S atoms of the top and bottom layers are closest to each other at

the path of sliding. The maximum value of the barrier is ∼ 50 meV. This type of barrier

is common for the T phase of TMDs. Following subsections investigate how these barrier

profiles are modified by electric field, charging and loading pressure.

A. Effect of External Electric Field

In this part, we investigate how the sliding potential is modified under the influence of an
external perpendicular electric field (E-field). Three different (0.05, 0.15, 0.25 V/A) E-field

values in the positive z-direction (perpendicular to the plane of bilayer system) are applied.

While the energy barrier is conserved, the barrier heights increases as shown in Figs. 4 (a)

11

FIG. 4: (Color online) The plot of the energy barrier in the armchair (a) and the zig-zag (b)

direction under zero and increasing electric fields. The blue line represents the zero electric field

case. The black, green and red lines are for 0.05, 0.15, 0.25 V/A electric field cases, respectively.

(c) electron transfer from outer S atoms to the inner part (upper) and the total number of electron

difference (lower) between the 0.25 V/A electric field case and the zero electric field case on the

sliding paths. (d) is the cross section of the total charge density difference between the 0.15, 0.25

V/A electric field cases and the zero field case for both AA and AB stacking orders. The color

code of the isosurface values are given.

and (b). The changes at 0.05 V/A field is negligible and the profiles are almost the same as

in the zero E-field case. In addition, for AB stacking the energy difference between the local

minimum and the neighboring local maximum decreases with applied E-field. The reason

of the changes can be elucidated by analyzing the variations of the charge separation in the

system.

12

FIG. 5: (Color online) Energy band dispersions under three different E-field which are 0.05, 0.15,

and 0.25 V/A perpendicular to the plane of structure. The blue curves are for AA stacking and

red curves are for AB stacking.

In Fig. 4 (c), by using the Bader charge analysis technique, the amount of charge difference
on the atoms between the 0.25 V/A case and the zero field case is shown along the sliding

path. The solid (dashed) orange curve represents the Sn atoms at the bottom (top) layer.

The solid (dashed) blue curve represents the outer S atom at the bottom (top) layer and

the solid (dashed) red curve is for the inner S atom (S atoms between the sublayers of Sn

atoms). The charge configurations seem to be sensitive not only to the E-field but also the

stacking order of the layers. Firstly, the charge variations of the Sn atoms of the bottom

and the top layers are positive which indicates that the E-field shifts electron around the

Sn atoms. On the other hand, the behaviors of the changes on the S atoms are different

according being at the outer or the inner part of the bilayer system. The outer S atoms have

less electrons under E-field while inner S atoms attain more electrons. As an exception to

these trends, the charge of the S atoms is not altered much by the E-field for the AA and

the AB stackings. It needs more detailed analysis.

To clarify the effect of the external E-field on the AA and AB bilayer systems, the total

charge density difference between with- and without-E-field for the cross section through

the atoms in the unitcell are shown in Fig. 4(d). It seems that the S atoms are polarized by
the E-field, but the Sn atoms experience no significant change. In the case of 0.15 V/A, the

polarizations are larger at the inner sides of S atoms for both AA and AB stackings. In the
case of 0.25 V/A, the polarization vanishes at the outer S atoms for AA stacking order. On

the other hand, the polarization still exists and is enhanced at the inner S atoms of AA and

13

all S atoms of AB stacking. More importantly, the number of electron increases gradually

between the layers with electric field strength for both the AA and the AB stackings. This

charge accumulation between the layers is consistent with the study of Ramasubramaniam

et al.76 where the MoS2 bilayer is tuned by the external E-field and the charge distribution

between the layers was gradually enhanced with increasing out of plane E-field. According

to our results, the perpendicular E-field increases the coupling between the SnS2 layers for

AA stacking as compared to AB.

In addition, the E-field dramaticaly modifies the electronic structure of the bilayer system

as shown in Fig. 5. Under the E-field, the VBM approaches to Γ point while the CBM at

M point drops in energy which means that band gap decreases. The drop of band gap with
E-field is slower for the AA stacking, so under 0.25 V/A E-field, the AB become semi-metal

while the AA stacked bilayer is semiconductor with band gap 85 meV within GGA. Although

this is the underestimated band gap, the trend of change on electronic structure together

with enhanced stacking strength at AA order indicates that perpendicular E-field is useful

method for tunning the band gap of bilayer SnS2 which is needed in a material for the field

effect transistor application.

B. Effect of Charging

The sliding-energy barrier can also be tuned by controlling the total charge on the system.

In this part, we examine the modifications of the sliding barrier by adding or subtracting

electron (doping electron or hole) to the bilayer. In Figs. 6 (a) and (b), we show respectively

the barriers forms along the armchair and the zig-zag directions for four different charging

conditions. Positive value of charging refers to extra electrons. First of all, it is interesting

that the 0.2 e− and also the 0.1 e− (per unit cell) cases result in a minimum energy for the AB

stacking instead of AA. In addition, the barrier height decreases in all charging conditions

and the shape of the barrier differs considerably for the armchair direction. Moreover,

the maximum barrier height in the zig-zag direction decreases down to ∼20 meV which is

comparable with the thermal energy at room temperature (25 meV).

The effect of charging can be understood by monitoring the charge localizations for AA

and AB stacking. Therefore, in Fig. 6(c), the cross section of the charge density differences

between the charged and the bare systems is shown for AA and AB stackings. It is expected

14

FIG. 6: (Color online) Plot of the energy barrier for sliding in the armchair (a) and the zig-zag (b)

direction for four different charging cases and the bare case. Positive value of charing refers to a

higher electron density. The blue curves represents the bare case. The green, the black, the yellow

and the red curves are for the charging case of −0.2, −0.1, 0.1, 0.2 e−. (c) Cross section of the

total charge density difference between the charged cases and the bare case.

that only positively charged regions to appear in the plot for the electron subtracted system.

For the electron-added system, the expectation is the opposite. However the occurrence of

both positive and negative regions for each charging case indicates that charging (positive

or negative) modifies the distribution of the other electrons. In Fig. 6(c), it is explicitly seen

that the inserted charges accumulate to the outer surfaces (red for positive charges and blue

for the negative charges) of the bilayer system. In all cases, except the 0.2 e− added to AA

stacking, the electrons (blue region) also accumulate to the region between the layers. When

we compare the AA and AB stackings in all charging conditions, the lower energy case has

always a larger amount of electrons (negative charge means blue region) between the layers

15

which indicates that the interactions between the layers have covalent character.

In addition, when electrons are doped, s orbital of Sn atoms which mostly construct

the CBM are firstly occupied as shown in Fig. 7. The energy difference between the newly

occupied Sn states and the already occupied S states decreases. The change is higher for the

AB stacking as compared to AA. For the hole doping case, px and py orbitals of S atoms

which are dominant around the Fermi level (VBM) are firstly occupied. To sum up, both

electron and hole doping decreases sliding barrier which makes easier to modify the stacking

order, and for proper value of electron doping, favorable stacking order become AB stacking

instead of AA.

FIG. 7: (Color online) Energy band dispersions for four different charging conditions which are

−0.2, −0.1, 0.1, and 0.2 e−. The negative numbers refer the electron subtracted (hole doping)

cases and the positive numbers refer the electron added (electron doping) cases. The blue curves

are for AA stacking and red curves are for AB stacking.

C. Bilayer Under Loading Pressure

The energy landscape of bilayers under constant loading pressure is studied for various

2D materials.77 It is shown that for a given value of the applied pressure, the ratio between

intralayer and interlayer interaction is a material property that describes the transition

from the stick-slip to the superlubric regime. Here we study the effect of a constant loading

pressure on the energy landscape of bilayer SnS2.

The AA and the AB stackings of bilayers, composed of materials like MoS2, have the

same energy due to the symmetry of the 1H structure. However, the energy of bilayer SnS2

in 1T is different for AA and AB stackings. This is evident from the previous figures in this

16

section as well as from Fig. 8(a) where we present the constant height energy landscape of

the SnS2 bilayer. To calculate the energy landscape at constant pressure we repeat constant
height scans by lowering the height by 0.2 A steps. In this way we get the energy for the

three-dimensional movement of the layers with respect to each other. We use this data to

create the plots presented in Fig. 8(b). Here for a chosen loading pressure we first find

the corresponding force in the z-direction. Then using spline interpolation we calculate

the height that gives this force for each position in the xy plane while moving from AA

stacking to AB stacking.

Interestingly, as the applied pressure is increased the relative

energy difference between AA and AB stacking decreases and become even zero at 3 GPa.

For pressures exceeding 3 GPa AB stacking becomes more favorable than AA stacking.

FIG. 8: (Color online) (a) Constant height energy landscape of bilayer SnS2. The height is fixed

at the value corresponding to the distance between the top and the bottom sulfur atoms when the

bilayer is fully relaxed. (b) The constant pressure energy dependence along the line connecting the

AA and the AB stackings.

V. CONCLUSION

Starting from the monolayer, the electronic and the optical properties of bilayer SnS2

are investigated within first principles DFT calculations. We found that the interaction

between the layers is weaker than that of MoS2 and other common TMDs. We showed that

although the layers interact weakly the energy band gaps and the absorbance spectra could

be informative about the stacking type of the bilayer system. The energy barrier for the

sliding of one layer over the other is found to be ∼ 65 meV at its maximum which is also

17

small as compared to MoS2.

The effect of applied E-field, charging and loading pressure on the sliding barrier of

bilayer SnS2 were also studied. Under the influence of a perpendicular E-field, for the AA

stacking which is favorable for the bilayer system, the coupling of the layer strengthens and

consequently the sliding barrier height increases. In addition, it is shown that band gap of

the bilayer SnS2 can be tuned by perpendicular E-field and under sufficient E-field it can be

turned from semiconductor to semi-metal. On the other hand, both adding and subtracting

electrons decreases the barrier. More significantly, under charging or loading pressure, AB

stacking order can become the favorable configuration instead of AA stacking. Tunable

bandgap makes 2D crystal of SnS2 a promising material for nanometer size field effect

transistor applications. Furthermore, due to its easy-tunable stacking sequence, layered

SnS2 is also a good candidate for nanoscale lubricant applications.
