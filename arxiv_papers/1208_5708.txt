Abstract

We show that the existence of a pair of zero-energy modes bound to a vortex

carrying a π-flux is a generic feature of the topologically non-trivial phase
of the M − B model, which was introduced to describe the topological band
insulator in HgTe quantum wells. We explicitly find the form of the zero-

energy states of the corresponding Dirac equation, which contains a novel

momentum-dependent mass term and describes a generic topological transi-

tion in a band insulator. The obtained modes are exponentially localized in

the vortex-core, with the dependence of characteristic length on the param-

eters of the model matching the dependence extracted from a lattice version

of the model. We consider in full generality the short-distance regularization

of the vector potential of the vortex, and show that a particular choice yields

the modes localized and simultaneously regular at the origin. Finally, we

also discuss a realization of two-dimensional spin-charge separation through

the vortex zero-modes.

1. Introduction

Topological band insulators (TBIs) have recently opened a new frontier

in both theoretical and experimental condensed-matter physics due to their

peculiar properties (extensive reviews are in Refs. [1, 2]). These stem from

the fundamental fact that TBIs are described by topological field theories

[3], thereby taking the interest in studying them far outside the standard

condensed-matter domain. The novelty of TBIs is their protection by time-
reversal symmetry (TRS), which leads to a non-trivial topological Z2 invari-
ant [4] of their free electron crystalline band structure, and to a description

in terms of the topological BF theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D [5]. Striking

consequences of their topological nature are the remarkable effective field

theories describing the responses of TBIs, for instance, axion electrodynam-

ics in (3+1)D [6] and gravitational Chern-Simons in thermal response [6, 7].

Such theories are governed by anomalies, and the possibility of their direct

study, e.g. through the Witten effect of axion electrodynamics [8], is of great

interest and potential for both the high-energy and condensed matter com-

munities. Further beyond the non-interacting case, there has been a proposal

of (3+1)D fractional TBIs [9], having TRS and an axion angle different from

0 or π; these have a description in the form of deconfined non-Abelian gauge

fields explicitly realized using holography [10].

The salient feature of TBIs, crucial for their characterization and detec-

tion, is that they are fully gapped in the bulk while possessing on their bound-

ary gapless propagating modes protected by TRS. [1, 2] The presence of TRS

however limits, fundamentally and especially experimentally, the availabil-

ity of robust probes of such bulk-boundary correspondence, aforementioned

2

anomalous responses, and Z2 topological order itself. For instance, in (2+1)D
TBIs, on which we are focusing from now on, the charge Hall response van-

ishes, and instead a much more involved TRS invariant quantum spin Hall

(QSH) effect characterizes the topological phase.

It has been understood

through numeric studies that a π-flux vortex, which actually preserves TRS,
can play exactly the role of a Z2 probe in a QSH insulator through appearance
of topologically protected zero-modes. [5, 11, 12, 13]

In this paper, we analytically study the properties of π-flux vortex in
presence and absence of Z2 order. The general way by which we achieve this
is using the M − B model initially constructed to describe the HgTe quan-
[14, 15] The salient and universal feature of the
tum well QSH insulator.

low-energy (continuum) version of this model is that it describes a topolog-
ical phase transition between a trivial and non-trivial Z2 topological phase,
through a massive Dirac-Schrodinger theory. This field theory, especially in

the presence of a U (1) vortex, has not been widely studied for its own sake.

A peculiar property of this theory is that the presence of both linear and

quadratic kinetic terms together with the ordinary Dirac mass term allows

for a gap-closing transition which changes the Chern number of the bands
and the Z2 invariant. The same theory turns out to harbor analytically
solvable zero-modes tied to π-flux vortex, but only in the non-trivial phase.

The relationship of the π-flux modes to the QSH phase and the ques-

tion of their protection are general problems in the context of zero-energy

fermionic modes bound to a topological defect. Namely, as Aharonov and

Casher have shown in Ref. [16], when non-relativistic (Schrodinger) fermions

are coupled to a magnetic flux carrying n flux quanta there are precisely

3

n zero-energy modes in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Later, Jackiw in

Ref. [17] has demonstrated that a magnetic flux with n flux quanta hosts

precisely n zero-energy modes when coupled to relativistic Dirac fermions,

and they are related to an index theorem for the Dirac Hamiltonian defined

on a compact space.[18] On the other hand, the existence of fermionic zero-

modes bound to a vortex in the complex scalar order parameter has actually

been established in one and two spatial dimensions in the pioneering works

by Jackiw and Rebbi[19] and Jackiw and Rossi[20], respectively. Their ex-

istence is, at the deep mathematical level, tied to an index theorem that

relates the spectral asymmetry of the corresponding Hamiltonian defined on

an open space and a topological invariant of the background scalar fields.[21]

At the same time, the results of Jackiw and Rebbi have been applied to the

polyacetilene system through the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.[22] However,
the connection between Jackiw-Rossi and the M − B model, relevant for the
quantum spin Hall system, has been shown only very recently in Ref. [23].

Namely, these authors have demonstrated that the Jackiw-Rossi model in

the limit when Zeeman coupling and the chemical potential are large reduces
to the M − B model, and therefore the results presented in this work are also
relevant for this problem. Moreover, a Hamiltonian of the same form as the
M − B Hamiltonian describes non-relativistic px + ipy superconductor, and
the results of our work are thus relevant for this system as well. In partic-

ular, our solution for the zero-energy mode bound to a π-flux vortex in the

quantum spin Hall state corresponds to the Majorana state in the core of a

π-flux vortex in this topological superconductor.

The flux-carrying vortex is by its definition singular in real space. It is well

4

known that a Hamiltonian with singular potential (e.g. Aharonov-Bohm flux

vortex [24, 25], Coulomb potential [26, 27, 28], delta function potential [29]),

once made Hermitian through a self-adjoint extension [30], can exhibit finite

or zero-energy bound states, even if the original Hamiltonian was scale-free.

Therefore, the question of regularizing the vortex singularity, and thereby

completely defining a Hermitian fermionic theory, becomes physically rel-

evant.

It fixes the real space profile of zero-modes at the vortex and the

scattering phase shift there. This problem has been considered for (2+1)D

[24, 31], and (3+1)D [32] Dirac particles, as well as quasiparticles in super-
conductors [25]. The Dirac-Schrodinger theory of the M − B model has not
been studied in this context before, and we find here the general form of the

regularized theory in presence of a magnetic π flux vortex. Furthermore, we

show that a regularization corresponding to a thin solenoid limit surprisingly

leads to localized zero-modes that vanish at the origin.

In this paper, we first explicitly introduce the tight-binding and contin-
uum M − B models. Then we use the continuum M − B model to ana-
lytically show that the π-flux vortex hosts precisely a pair of exponentially

localized zero-energy modes, and therefore the states found numerically in
Refs. [33, 13] are indeed a generic feature of the M − B model. Moreover,
the relationship of these midgap states with the topological properties of the

quantum spin Hall state are also considered. Namely, we show that these

modes, in fact, exist in the entire range of parameters describing topologi-
cally non-trivial phase in the M − B model with the gap opening near the
zero momentum (Γ point) in the Brillouin zone. For obtaining the explicit

form of the midgap states, a short-distance regularization of the Hamiltonian

5

is necessary due to the singularity of the vortex potential. We show that a

particular choice, corresponding to a limit of infinitely thin solenoid, yields

the modes non-singular at the origin. We then consider in full generality the

problem of consistent regularization of the vortex potential, and show that

the corresponding self-adjoint extensions are given in terms of parameters

described by U (2) matrices. Next, we test the prediction for the localization

length of the zero-modes obtained from the continuum theory as a function

of the transition driving parameter by comparing it to the results from a

lattice regularization of the model. Finally, we discuss the quantum numbers

of the obtained zero-energy states.

2. The M − B tight-binding model on the square lattice

We begin by considering a minimal tight-binding model proposed to de-

scribe a two-band quantum spin Hall insulator [14]

(1)

where Ψ(cid:62) = (u↑, v↑, u↓, v↓) ≡ (Ψ↑, Ψ↓), with u and v representing two low-
energy orbitals. The upper and the lower blocks in the Hamiltonian are

related by time-reversal symmetry, and H(k) acting in the orbital space has

the form

H(k) = σµdµ(k),

(2)

where σµ, µ = 1, 2, 3, are the Pauli matrices, d1,2(k) = A sin kx,y, and d3 =
M−2B(2−cos kx−cos ky), the length unit is set by lattice constant a = 1, and
summation over repeated indices is assumed hereafter. We also set  = c =

6

e = 1 in the following, unless otherwise stated. Since the above Hamiltonian

has spectrum E(k) =(cid:112)dµdµ doubly degenerate in spin space, the band gap

closes at the Γ-point (k = 0) in the Brillouin zone when the value of model

parameters is M/B = 0. We will only consider the range of parameters

0 < M/B < 4 in what follows, so that the spectrum is gapped. This lattice

model then describes a topologically nontrivial state with a Kramers' pair of

counterpropagating modes on the edge of the system leading to a quantized

spin Hall conductance[15] σS

xy = 2 e2

h . For negative values of M/B, the model

describes a trivial insulator (σS

xy = 0).

3. The Dirac-Schrodinger continuum theory

By taking the continuum, i.e. large wavelength limit (k (cid:28) 1) of (2), we
arrive at a Dirac Hamiltonian which besides the ordinary Dirac mass term

(M ) contains a Schrodinger kinetic term (B)

Heff(k) = iγ0γiki + (M − Bk2)γ0,

(3)

where the four-dimensional γ-matrices are given by γ0 = σ3 ⊗ τ0, γ1 = σ2 ⊗
τ3, and γ2 = −σ1 ⊗ τ0. Here, Pauli matrices {τ0, τµ} act in spin space,
with σ0, τ0 as the 2 × 2 identity matrices. The γ-matrices satisfy canonical
anticommutation relations {γα, γβ} = 2δαβ, with α, β = 0, 1, 2. Notice that it
is enough to focus on a single spin projection, since the two spin projections
are related by the time-reversal operator T = −iτ2K, with K as the complex
conjugation. For convenience, we have divided through Eq. (1) by the energy

scale A (the lattice intersite hopping energy) and by the length-scale a, before
redefining M/(Aa) → M , Ba/A → B, so that the continuum theory Eq. (3)

7

has a dimensionless parameter M B and parameters B and (cid:112)B/M with

dimension of length (we revert to lattice units for comparison to the tight

binding model in Section 7).

4. Zero-energy states

Let us now consider the effect of the magnetic π-flux inserted into the

system. As usually, the vector potential is coupled to the electronic degrees of
freedom through the minimal substitution, k → k + A, and the Hamiltonian
(3) for spin up electrons assumes the form

Heff(k, A) = σi(ki + Ai) + [M − B(k + A)2]σ3.

The vector potential

A =

−yex + xey

2r2

(4)

(5)

represents the magnetic vortex carrying the flux Φ = π. Notice that the spin

down electrons are coupled to the π-flux with the opposite sign because of

the time-reversal symmetry, and in that respect π-flux thus acts on the spin

components as a pseudomagnetic vortex in graphene does on the two valley

degrees of freedom.[34, 35, 36] Of course, the time-reversal invariance of the

Hamiltonian (4) is present only when the flux corresponding to the vector

potential A is equal to π or 0.

We now show that the above Hamiltonian possesses precisely one bulk

zero-energy state with spin up. Time-reversal symmetry then implies the

existence of the zero-energy state for electrons with spin down. Expressing

the Hamiltonian (4) in polar coordinates (r, ϕ), taking into account that

8

an arbitrary flux Φ, the Hamiltonian (4) also acquires the form (6), but with
the operator ∂ϕ = ∂ϕ + iΦ/2π.

In the presence of a vortex carrying a π-flux, we seek the zero-energy

modes of the form

This result may also be obtained by noting that if the spinor in Eq. (7) is an

eigenstate with the zero eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian (4), then it is also an

eigenstate with the same eigenvalue of the square of this Hamiltonian. Using

Eq. (4), one then readily obtains

Heff(k, A)2 = B2(k2)2 + (1 − 2M B)k2 + M 2,

(14)

with k ≡ k + A, and the operator k2 after acting on the angular part of
the upper component of the spinor (7) yields Eq. (13). Similarly, it may

be shown that the function vl(r) in the spinor given by Eq. (7) obeys an
equation of the same form as (13) with l → l + 1. From Eq. (13) we conclude
that the function ul−1(r) is an eigenfunction of the operator Ol−1/2 with a
positive eigenvalue

Ol− 1

2

ul−1(r) = λ2ul−1(r),

(15)

since the operator k2 when acting on a function with the angular momentum
l is equal to −Ol+1/2, and the eigenstates of the operator k2 with a negative
eigenvalue are localized. Eqs. (13) and (15) then imply

ones are in the zero angular-momentum channel since Il(x) ∼ x−l as x → 0.
Furthermore, for l = 0 only the linear combination I1/2(x) − I−1/2(x) ∼

of the state.

In the above equation we should distinguish two regimes of

parameters, 0 < M B < 1/4 and M B > 1/4, for which the argument of the

square-root is positive and negative, respectively.

For 0 < M B < 1/4, since the argument of the square-root in the above

equation is positive, we obtain two zero-energy solutions

Therefore, we can conclude that the Hamiltonian (4) possesses zero-energy

modes in the entire range of parameters M and B for which the system

is in the topologically non-trivially phase, 0 < M/B < 4.

In particular,

as it can be seen from Eq. (16), when 4M B < 1 zero-energy states are

purely exponentially localized, while for 4M B > 1 the exponentially localized

solutions have an oscillatory part with a characteristic length-scale exactly

equal to the localization length.

Notice also that in the regime when 0 < M B < 1/4, there are two charac-
teristic length scales associated with the midgap modes, ξ± ∼ λ−1± . Of course,
after a short-distance regularization is imposed, only a linear combination of

the two states survives. The physical interpretation of the two length scales

depends on the form of the superposition of the state after the regularization

has been imposed, as it may be easily seen from the form of the states (17).

In the regime M B > 1/4, the zero-energy states are characterized by a single
length-scale ξloc ∼ 2B, which is at the same time the localization length and
characterizes the oscillations of the exponentially decaying state.

Therefore, the appearance of the zero-energy states bound to a π-flux

vortex is a generic feature of the Hamiltonian (3) describing the quantum

spin Hall system. Furthermore, in the vortex-free system, it may be shown

by imposing open boundary conditions on the wave-function at one of the

12

edges of the system, for instance the one perpendicular to the x-axis, and
at infinity, Ψ(x, y = 0) = Ψ(x, y = ∞) = 0, that the Hamiltonian gives rise
to gapless edge modes with the penetration depth given by exactly the same

expression as the localization length for the zero-energy modes bound to the

π-flux vortex. The bulk-boundary correspondence may be thus probed by

inserting a π-flux vortex in the quantum spin Hall system.

5. Thin solenoid regularization of vortex

The zero-energy modes, given by Eqs. (17) and (21), form an overcomplete

basis in the zero angular-momentum channel, because the Hamiltonian (4) is

not self-adjoint, which is due to the singularity of the vortex vector potential

(5) at the origin. Thus the gauge potential has to be regularized.

A possible regularization is provided by considering the vortex with the

flux concentrated in a thin annulus of a radius R. Let us first consider the

Hamiltonian in the range of parameters 0 < M B < 1/4. The zero-energy

state of the Hamiltonian outside the annulus is then a linear combination

of the modes Ψ± given by Eq. (17). Inside the annulus the vector potential

A = 0, and the zero-energy modes are

 e−iϕI1(λ+r)

iI0(λ+r)

 + C2

 e−iϕI1(λ−r)

 ,

iI0(λ−r)

Ψ<(r) = C1

with λ± given by Eq. (16), and C1,2 being complex constants. By matching
these solutions at r = R, and taking R → 0, we obtain, up to a normalization
constant, the zero-energy state of the form
e−λ+r − e−λ−r

Ψ(r) =

 e−iϕ

i

 .

√

r

13

(22)

(23)

Notice that this zero-energy state is regular at the origin which is a conse-

quence of the regularity at the origin of the solutions (22) of the vortex-free

problem. Similarly, one may show that when M B > 1/4 the zero-energy

mode is given by the spinor Ψ2 in Eq. (18) also regular at the origin and
behaving ∼ r1/2 when r → 0.

6. Self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian

Although the above regularization results in concrete solutions to the

problem, we should consider the self-adjoint extension of the corresponding

Hamiltonian (4) in a more general manner by specifying the proper Hilbert

space. That way, a family of Hermitian Hamiltonians is obtained, depending

on free physical parameters that determine the scattering at the vortex core

and the detailed profile of the single zero-mode (per spin). In the last section,

we will comment on the regularization provided by the tight-binding version

of the model, Eq. (2).

The application of the standard theory of self-adjoint extensions (SAE)

[30, 37, 26, 29] prescribes that we need to ensure that the massive Dirac

Hamiltonian (a differential operator) becomes Hermitian (self-adjoint) only

after choosing the proper Hilbert space (i.e. domain of functions) on which

it is allowed to act.

Instead of analyzing the imaginary spectrum (which

needs to be removed), we implement von Neumann's construction by looking

directly at the conditions under which the Hamiltonian is Hermitian when

acting on arbitrary functions that are square integrable (but might diverge at

the origin, due to diverging potential there). This will effectively determine

the coefficients of the linear combination C1Ψ+ +C2ψ− in angular momentum

14

channel l = 0 and thereby fix the zero-mode.

Using symmetry, we start from the radial part of the operator, H l(r),

which acts in the subspace of angular momentum l spanned by functions of

e−iϕul

the form

ψl(r) ≡ eilϕ

Ψ↑(x, y) =

where ψ(r, ϕ) is exactly of the form in Eq. (24).

We also implement the standard change of scalar product in r-space by
∂ ψl(r) (∂ always denotes d/dr), where

ψl(r), ∂ψl(r) = 1√

rescaling ψl(r) = 1√

We have reverted to the standard derivative (∂) here. Since the π-flux enters
through l → lef f , we omit it here. The non-derivative terms will not play any
role in the following analysis since the standard 'centrifugal force' provided
by l (cid:54)= 0 does not lead to singularities. However, the gauge potential will
have the chance to provide us with the boundary condition exactly when

l = 0.

There is a continuous family of restrictions on the behavior of square-

integrable functions at the origin, such that (27) is satisfied, leading to the

Hamiltonian which is Hermitian on such a chosen domain. The proper

parametrization of the most general restriction on the allowed domains is

achieved by using the linearity of (27). Namely, we define two linear opera-
tors Γ1, Γ2 which map arbitrary functions, i.e. the domain of H†, onto their
value at the boundary, i.e. the space of complex two component vectors:

The most general relation that has to be satisfied by a wavefunction such

that (27) will hold is now parametrized by unitary mappings S in Hb:

D( HU ) = {ψ(S − σ0)Γ1ψ + i(S + σ0)Γ2ψ = 0},

(32)

with σ0 the 2x2 identity matrix, and D denoting the domain of operator. One
can directly understand from (29) that forcing arbitrary linear combinations
U (0) to zero will still preserve the condition (27), due
of a general U (0) and ∂r

to the linearity and the antisymmetric nature of the form of this expression.

Eq. (32) is giving us a precise recipe and parametrization of the fact that this

is the most general restriction that needs to be made on the wavefunctions
U (r), i.e. on the ψ(r).

We now proceed to use the form of Γi to explore the allowed boundary

conditions on the wavefunctions, in particular determining whether there is
a self-adjoint extension HU with the previously found zero energy states in

its domain. For concreteness we focus on the case M B < 1/4.

Since Hb is C2, our mappings S ∈ U (2), in contrast to the same problem
in the case of an ordinary massive Dirac Hamiltonian necessitating a U (1)

Due to normalization, both φ and φ(cid:48) depend only on the vector ( 1

(36)

It turns out that the case with η = 0 is special, and so we examine it first in

detail. Only this subclass contains the extension with regular zero-modes.

6.1. Extensions described by SU (2), η = 0

Eqs. (32), (33) lead to the following condition on two quaternions P, Q:

B · P φ(cid:48) = Qφ,

(38)
Once the values of M, B (and therefore also λ1/2 ≡ λ±) are given, this equa-
tion determines x as function of the particular SAE mµ (if a solution for x

18

exists), and x then determines the specific linear combination of λ1/2 decay-

ing functions in the zero mode, influencing also its regularity properties at
the origin. Since det(P ) = 2(m0 − 1), we first consider:

6.1.1. Extension with η = 0, m0 = 1

According to definition (33) this immediately implies (cid:126)m = 0, and

σ0φ = 0 ⇐⇒ √
C1 = −C2.

rψ0r=0 = 0, i.e.

(39)

(40)

Such a wavefunction is regular at the origin and localized on the scale 1/min(λi),

no matter the values M, B (or λ1,2). We therefore see that such a wavefunc-

tion is allowed when the physical SAE is given by S = [1, 0, 0, 0], η = 0. This
will turn out to be the only extension allowing x = −1, see Fig. 1, essentially
because it is the only extension for which the matrix on the left-hand side of

Eq. (37) vanishes.

6.1.2. Extension with η = 0, m0 < 1

We must now consider Eq. (37) as a vector equation, treating C1,2 as

unknown variables. We get

C1

C2

Y

 = 0
Baλ1 + p Baλ2 + p

where a ≡ P11 + iP12, b ≡ P21 + iP22, p ≡ Q11 + iQ12, q ≡ Q21 + iQ22. There
are solutions only when

aq = bp ⇔ m2 = 0.

(44)
So in the case of m0 (cid:54)= 1, the zero energy mode is allowed in principle only
for Hamiltonians with m2 = 0. The value of x in such a system is given by

x = −g(λ2)
g(λ1)

g(λ) ≡ Baλ + p = Bbλ + q,

is a linear function of λ. From this expression it seems that another way
for x = −1 (and the zero mode becoming regular at the origin for all model
parameters M, B), is if m1 = 1, where we assume λ1 (cid:54)= λ2. However, this
is not the case, because when m1 = 1 only one component of the vector

equation Eq. (41) can be satisfied, and not both component equations at the

same time.

Note that the extensions identified here by having m2 = 0 include the case
from previous subsection, m0 = 1. In fact, demanding that x = −1 directly
from Eq. (41) implies that the columns of Y must be the same, which reduces
to the demand a = b = 0 ⇒ P = [0, 0, 0, 0] since λ1,2 are non-degenerate. It
is easy to see, using the definition Eq. (33), that this is only possible in the

above considered case m0 = 1.

20

6.2. Dependence on M B

To analyze possible values for x for given model parameters M, B, we

parametrize the SAE using hyperspherical coordinates

mµ = (cos ψ, sin ψ cos θ, sin ψ sin θ cos ϕ, sin ψ sin θ sin ϕ),

(47)
where the hypersphere SU (2) (cid:39) S3 is properly covered by ψ ∈ [0, π], θ ∈
[0, π], and ϕ ∈ [0, 2π). The condition m2 = 0, Eq. (44), means ϕ = π/2,

and also ψ (cid:54)= 0 (m0 (cid:54)= 1), (ψ, θ) (cid:54)= ( π
This parametrization can be plugged into the function g(λ) from Eq. (46)

determined by ψ, θ. Analysis shows that x(ψ, θ) weakly depends on the value
of k ≡ M B, and so Fig. 1 presents the typical behavior for fixed k. On the
(ψ, θ) plane, the function x(ψ, θ) is strongly localized and a sharply peaked

dipole. One can use the real and imaginary parts of x to identify structure

in the scattering phase shift coming from the regularized vortex.

6.3. From SU (2) to U (2) extensions, η (cid:54)= 0

The introduction of η (cid:54)= 0 in Eq. (33) does not change the analysis method

of previous subsections.

To start, the expressions for quaternions P, Q in Eq. (37) are slightly more
complicated, so that demanding x = −1 through the vanishing of left-hand
side of Eq. (37), as in Eq. (39), becomes
det(P ) ≡ 0, i.e.

(48)

m3 + i(1 − m0)
m3 − i(1 − m0)

.

exp(iη) =

21

However, even when the determinant vanishes, the matrix P can not become
zero matrix, unless cos(η) = 1 ⇒ η = 0, which actually just takes us back to
a SAE considered in previous subsections.

Next, considering Eqs. (37) by treating C1, C2 as unknowns, as in Eq. (41),

implies that zero-modes can exist only for a SAE that has

det(Y ) = 0 =⇒

exp(iη) =

(51)

,

where in the last line we used the parametrization from Eq. (47).

We emphasize that here, as for η = 0 case, demanding a zero-mode with
x = −1 implies from Eq. (41) that the columns of Y have to be the same.
Since λ1,2 are not degenerate for physical values of M B, this gives a = b = 0,

the already considered demand that the matrix P vanishes, which is

i.e.
impossible when η (cid:54)= 0.

Following the derivation of Eq. (45), the x in general is again given by a

ratio

x = − g(mµ, η, λ2)
g(mµ, η, λ1)

,

(52)

where we omit the lengthy explicit expression for g. Notice that even when
this ratio approaches a singular limit by g → 0 or ∞, the previous paragraph
ensures that x will not reach the value −1.

To summarize, the SAE analysis of the M − B model shows that a U (2)
parametrization which completes this model allows the existence of zero mod-

esfor a subclass of Hamiltonians described by three free angle parameters,

e.g. η, θ, ψ in Eq. (47). These determine a matrix relating the value of the

mode wavefunction Ψ0 ∼ r−1/2(xe−λ1r + e−λ2r), is presented as a function of the SAE
parametrized by two angles (ψ, θ), and η = 0 (see Section 6). The wavefunction becomes
regular at the origin for x = −1. Notice that Re(x) approaches −1 for ψ = 0, where
also Im(x) = 0. The plots are evaluated for M B = 0.15, but are representative for all

Eq. (37). There is only a single SAE, Section 6.1.1, determined by η = ψ = 0,

which allows for the existence of a zero energy state which is both localized

and regular (vanishing) at the origin.

7. Comparison to the tight-binding M − B model

In this Section we present the results from a tight-binding M − B model,
which in momentum space has the limit Eqs. (1), (2). We numerically study

this model on a 31x31 sized square lattice with periodic boundary conditions

and a π-flux -- anti-π-flux pair positioned at maximal distance. The details

of this tight-binding model written in real space, i.e. on the lattice, are

presented in Ref. [11].

We first isolate the zero energy mode localized on a single π-flux, using

the nearly degenerate inversion-symmetric and anti-symmetric zero modes on

excellent agreement in the M B < 1/4 regime. The lattice model has a phase transition

at Mlatt/Blatt = 4 which is absent in the continuum model, since the gap closes at finite

momentum. b) The complex constant x = C1/C2 determines the form of the zero-mode
wavefunction. When x = −1 the mode is regular at the π-flux, and this situation is
realized throughout the regime M B < 1/4 (dots in the legend mark the values of M B of

the plotted points).

the finite lattice. The lattice symmetries guarantee the (exp (−iφ), i)T form
of the wavefunction spinor, with φ the polar angle, just as in the continuum.

By fitting the radial envelope of the spinor using Eq. (17) and the angle-
averaged wavefunction, we extract the two localization lengths ξ±
latt in units
of the lattice constant. The results are shown in Fig. 2(a). The agreement

with the present continuum model prediction, see text after Eq. (18) and

Eq. (16), is excellent in the M B < 1/4 regime (inset of Fig. 2(a)). For

M B > 1/4 the oscillatory part of the wavefunction (see Eq. (21)) makes the

numerical fitting less reliable, and the agreement is only qualitative.

scale, the lattice constant a, beside its dimensionless constants Mlatt, Blatt (in

units of inter-site hopping energy A), see Eq. (1). In the present continuum

model, Eq. (4), the parameters M, B determine two length-scales, B and
B1/2M−1/2, where the former acts as a length-scale in the zero-modes. The

lattice constant is simply absorbed by Mlatt, Blatt to give M, B of the con-

tinuum model (see Eq. (3)), and that is why the agreement in Fig. 2(a) is
quantitatively precise. (In the lattice calculation we actually set Blatt ≡ 1
and vary only Mlatt, driving therefore both the parameter M B = MlattBlatt

and the lattice topological transition parameter Mlatt/Blatt.)

To determine the SAE which is realized in the lattice model, we calculate

the complex constant x = C1/C2, which was defined in Eq. (36), and rep-

resents the ratio of contributions of two singular functions in the zero-mode

wavefunction, Eqs. (17), (21). Fig. 2(b) shows that throughout the regime
M B < 1/4, x keeps near the value x = −1, which is the special case of zero-
mode being regular at the π-flux position. As shown above, only a single SAE

allows this, and this SAE is also realized in a thin-solenoid regularization of

the continuum model.

8. Quantum numbers of the zero-energy modes

We will now show that these zero-energy modes carry non-trivial charge

or spin quantum number depending on their occupation. For that purpose,
we will write the continuum 4 × 4 Hamiltonian (3) coupled to a U (1) vector
potential as

H = iγ0γi(ki + Ai) + (M − B(k + A)2)γ0

(53)

25

with the vector potential A given by Eq. (5). Note that the unitary matrices
γ3 = σ2 ⊗ τ2 and γ5 = σ2 ⊗ τ1 anticommute with the gamma-matrices γα,
α = 0, 1, 2. Therefore, the Hamiltonian anticommutes with the matrices
Γ3 ≡ iγ0γ3 and Γ5 ≡ iγ0γ5 which then generate chiral (spectral) symmetry
relating states with positive and negative energies, i.e., if HE(cid:105) = EE(cid:105),
then, for instance, Γ5E(cid:105) =  − E(cid:105), and the matrix Γ5 reduces in the zero-
energy subspace of the Hamiltonian. These two properties then imply that

in the ground-state the expectation value of a traceless Hermitian operator

Q is given in terms of the zero-energy states of the Hamiltonian

.

(54)

Therefore, in the case of a quantum spin Hall insulator threaded by a π-flux

vortex, depending on the occupation of a pair of zero-energy states, there are

four possibilities for the ground state quantum numbers. Namely, when both

states are occupied or empty, according to the above expression, the charge is
+e or −e and the spin quantum number is zero. On the other hand, when one
of the states is occupied, the spin quantum number is +1/2 or −1/2, while
the charge is zero. In that way, the spin-charge separation, characteristic for

one-dimensional systems[22], appears also in a two-dimensional system [38],

and is tied to a topologically non-trivial nature of the quantum spin Hall

state [12, 13]. Similarly, zero-energy modes bound to the vortex core in an

antiferromagnetic state on a honeycomb lattice lead to the phenomenon of

spin fragmentation [39]; see Ref. [40] for a general discussion of this class of

problems in the context of Dirac systems.

Finally, let us note that the topological stability of π-flux zero-modes,

26

i.e. stability under smooth deformations of the vector potential, has been

strictly proved for both Dirac and Schrodinger Hamiltonians [16, 17], but for
the M − B model, which is a sum of both, we are not aware of an analogous
proof based on an index theorem.

9. Conclusions

In conclusion, we have shown that a pair of zero-modes bound to a mag-
netic π-flux are a generic feature of the M − B model in the topologically
non-trivial phase. The continuum Hamiltonian of that model has both Dirac

and Schrodinger kinetic terms and a mass, and has not been studied in de-

tail previously. We have analytically found the zero-modes in the presence of

the π-flux vortex in the entire range of parameters describing a topologically

non-trivial phase with the bandgap opening at the zero momentum. These

modes are exponentially localized around the vortex core, and a particular

regularization of the vector potential corresponding to the vortex yields the

modes regular at the origin, but in general, as we have shown, the form

of the solution depends on the short-distance regularization of the vortex.

Vortex zero modes obtained within a lattice tight-binding model match the

ones found for a particular self-adjoint extension of the continuum Hamilto-

nian. Finally, we discussed a realization of the two-dimensional spin-charge

separation through the vortex zero-modes.
