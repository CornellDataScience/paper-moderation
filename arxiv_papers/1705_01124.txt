Abstract

Exciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities exhibit many fundamental physical effects,

with some of them amenable to being controlled by external fields. The polariton transport is

affected by the polaritonic spin-orbit interaction, which is caused by the splitting of transverse-

electric and transverse-magnetic (TE-TM) modes. This is the basis for a polaritonic Hall effect,

called optical spin Hall effect (OSHE), which is related to the formation of spin/polarization tex-

tures in momentum space, determining anisotropic ballistic transport, as well as related textures

in real space. Owing to Coulombic interactions between the excitonic components of the polari-

tons, optical excitation of polaritons can affect the OSHE. We present a theoretical analysis of

the OSHE and its optical control in semiconductor double microcavities, i.e. two optically coupled

cavities, which are particularly well suited for the creation of polaritonic reservoirs that affect the

spin-texture-forming polaritons. The theory is formulated in terms of a set of double-cavity spinor-

polariton Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Numerical solutions feature, among other things, a controlled

rotation of the spin texture in momentum space. The theory also allows for an identification of

the effective magnetic field component that determines the optical control in phenomenological

pseudo-spin models in terms of exciton interactions and the polariton density in the second lower

polariton branch.

INTRODUCTION

Exciton polartions in semiconductor microcavities have been extensively studied for many

years [1 -- 6], in part because many of the intriguing features of cavity polaritons are associated

with their unique dispersion and small effective mass. Parametric amplification of polaritons,

which utilizes the so-called "magic angle" (the inflection point on the LPB) was observed.

Here, a weak probe beam in normal incidence experiences large amplification when a strong

beam pumps the polaritons at this angle (for example [4, 7 -- 19]; for reviews see for example

Refs. [14, 18 -- 20]). The small polariton mass has also allowed for the successful observation

of polariton Bose condensates [21 -- 27].

An important aspect of much of the aforementioned effects is the interaction between

polaritons (e.g. [3, 11, 28 -- 38]). A detailed non-perturbative (in the Coulomb interaction) T-

matrix analysis of two-exciton correlations in GaAs quantum wells, that fully determines the

nonlinear optical response in the coherent third-order (or χ(3)) regime, was presented in Refs.

[39 -- 41]. This work includes the full vectorial dependence of the third-order susceptibility

tensor and a biexcitonic resonance in the two-exciton T-matrix. In the T-matrix calculations

both non-zero wavevector wave functions as well at intermediate exciton states with non-

zero angular momentum are included. This work also provides a unifying foundation of

nonlinear polariton physics in that it clarifies the interaction's spin dependence, energy

dependence, and 2D characteristics (e.g. the logarithmic approach to zero at the continuum

threshold). The biexcitonic resonance discussed in [40, 42] has recently been related to a

Feshbach resonance [43] in microcavity polaritons. Further work on the third-order nonlinear

response and exciton-exciton interactions in GaAs quantum wells includes Refs. [44 -- 62].

In addition to exciton-exciton interactions, which lead to a polariton-polariton interac-

tion, semiconductor microcavities have an inherent polariton-spin orbit interaction, which

can be compared to spin-orbit interaction in other optical systems, for example the plas-

monic spin Hall effect [63], and spin orbit interactions of light [64 -- 68]. The physical origin of

the polariton-spin orbit interaction is the transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic (TE-

TM) splitting, which can be described in terms of an effective magnetic field, and which

in turn gives rise to a polaritonic spin Hall effect, which is called optical spin Hall effect

(OSHE) [69 -- 74]. Since polaritons with different in-plane wave vectors k experience differ-

ent effective magnetic fields B(k), an isotropic distribution of polaritons on a ring in wave

3

vector space can lead to an anisotropic polarization texture or pattern, both in real and

momentum (or wave vector) space. Such polarization/spin textures have been found for

excitations of linearly and circularly polarized polaritons in Ref. [70] and [74], respectively

(structurally similar polarization/spin textures are also present in different physical systems,

e.g. [75, 76]). The OSHE in wave vector space corresponds to that seen experimentally in

far-field observations, which are particularly important in possible photonics or spinoptron-

ics [77, 78] applications. The far field contains information on the (in this case anisotropic)

ballistic polariton transport, as it is an image of the spin-dependent polariton density in

momentum (or wave vector) space.

A system that is well-suited for the control of the polariton-spin transport and the OSHE

is a semiconductor double microcavity. The theory of polaritons in coupled multiple mi-

crocavities has been studied in Ref. [79], a demonstration of optical parametric oscillation

(OPO) in a triple microcavity has been reported in [80], and generation of entangled photons

in coupled microcavities has been proposed in [81]. Furthermore, the double cavity has been

used recently in an experimental observation of the controlled OSHE [82]. In that work,

the experimental observations are explained with the help of a simple pseudo-spin model

[69, 70]. The pseudo-spin vector S is given in terms of the Stokes parameters formed by the

polariton wave functions (its precise definition will be given below).

For our initial discussion it is sufficient to note that the pseudo-spin model highlights

the effect of the spin-orbit interaction on quantities that are readily observable in the far

field, namely the components of S(k), where k is the polariton's in-plane wave vector. The

evolution of S is given by an equation that includes a torque term, which has the standard

B(k) × S(k) form, found in many magnetic systems:

with B(k) = (∆k cos(2φk), ∆k sin(2φk), B3). Here ∆k is the TE-TM splitting at k = k.

It will become clear from the definition of S(k) given below that positive (negative) S1

corresponds to dominant x (y) linear polarization components of the polariton fields, and

positive (negative) S3 to dominant "+" ("-") circular polarizations. Additional details of

the torque model in the context of the optical control of the OSHE, including the complete

equation of motion for S(k, t), are given in [82].

If we assume "+" circularly polarized excitation and consider the example of a wave

vector in the diagonal direction, k ∝ (1, 1, 0), in other words the polar angle φk of the

wave vector is 45◦, then it turns out that the effective magnetic field has only a positive

B2 component[69, 70]. Initial circularly polarized polaritons will then experience a torque

as schematically indicated in Fig. 1a, which rotates S towards positive S1, i.e. towards x-

polarization, until it settles to steady state (in this case in the 1-3 plane). At φk = −45◦, the

negative B2 component of B would favor y-polarization, and the magnetic field directions

5

as a function of wave vector directions are schematically shown in Fig. 1b.

In the low-

excitation regime, in which polaritonic interactions can be neglected, the effective magnetic

field is restricted to the 1-2 plane. The possible control of the effective magnetic field is

based on polaritonic interactions. For the case of conventional single-cavity structures, it

has been pointed out that a B3 component can arise from polariton populations [78, 83].

With a non-zero B3 component, the polariton-spin dynamics related to the torque-like force

is more complicated, as schematically indicated in Fig. 1c. In Ref. [82] it was found that

the double-cavity allows for a well-controlled rotation of the polaritonic spin/polarization

texture in wave vector space, as indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 1d.

In the following, we develop a microscopic framework for the analysis of the spin/polarization

textures in real and wave vector space, we analyze the nonlinear case including polaritonic

ineractions, and we identify the B3 component of the effective magnetic field in terms of

microscopic quantities such as polariton wave functions and excitonic T-matrices.

II. POLARITONS IN SINGLE AND DOUBLE MICROCAVITIES

Before presenting more details of the microscopic theory in the following sections, let us

briefly summarize key aspects of semiconductor polaritonic microcavities. In their simplest

form, such cavities consist of one (or several) semiconductor quantum wells between two

mirrors (such as distributed Bragg reflectors, DBR). Excitons interact with the light field

inside the cavity to form exciton polaritons.

The excitonic component of the polariton provides a strong Coulombic spin-dependent

exciton-exciton interaction which is conceptually similar to the Heitler-London model for

chemical bonds in hydrogen molecules, where the sum (difference) of direct and exchange

interactions determine the singlet (triplet) molecular energies. For excitons, the results in

interactions T ++ (T +−) are different if the two excitons have same (opposite) circular po-

larization. For quantum well excitons, these interactions have been quantitatively evaluated

in Ref. [40], and for polaritons they result in a spin and energy-dependent interaction[42].

As mentioned above, these interactions have been found to be important in spin-dependent

optical nonlinearities (e.g. Ref. [5, 61]), Bose-Einstein condensates (for a review, see e.g.

Ref. [25]), spin-dependent optoelectronic devices (e.g. Ref. [77, 78]), and polaritonic Fesh-

bach resonances[43]. In the present context, they modify the effective spin-orbit interaction

branches, and real (solid lines) and imaginary (dashed lines) parts of exciton-exciton interactions

T ++ and T +− from Ref. [40]. The branch LP2 allows the normal incidence pump to enter the cavity.

The LP2 polaritons act as a source for LP1 polaritons, as indicated by the dashed horizontal arrows,

and simultaneously as a polariton reservoir that controls the orientation of the OSHE pattern. The

splitting between TE and TM polaritons, particularly large in our double-cavity structure, results

in spin-orbit coupling via an effective magnetic field[69]. Modification of the effective magnetic

field is enabled through optical pumping and the resulting spin-dependent interaction between

polaritons, which in turn is based on the underlying exciton-exciton interaction.

by modifying the effective magnetic field[78], and hence the spin and polarization texture of

the polariton field in real and wave vector space[84].

When discussing Fig. 1c, we noted that a circularly ("+") polarized pump beam results in

the tilting of the effective magnetic field B(k) out of the 1-2 plane in pseudo-spin space, and

hence can lead to a modification of the spatial polarization texture of the polaritons' linear

polarization components, Fig. 1d. However, a simple implementation of such an optical

pump scheme, which involves only a single spatial component and a quasi-monochromatic

pump acting both as the source of the polaritons involved in the OSHE and their external

control, is difficult in conventional single-cavity designs. A double-cavity that contains two

lower polariton branches can overcome those difficulties. A double-cavity consists of two sets

of quantum wells embedded in two cavities [82, 85]. The two cavities are coupled with each

7

other, and within each cavity, the cavity field is coupled with the excitons of the quantum

wells. This forms four polariton branches, with two upper and two lower polariton branches.

The reflectivity spectrum of a double-cavity is shown in Fig. 2. In contrast to an ordinary

single-cavity design, in the double-cavity system the reflectivity spectrum exhibits two min-

ima. The upper of the two lower polariton branches, LP2, yields a reflectivity window that

allows a normal-incidence monochromatic pump to enter the cavity, creating LP2 polaritons.

In the following, the upper polaritons are neglected as they are strongly detuned from the

pump frequency.

The pump exciting LP2 polaritons also creates a small population of LP1 polaritons,

mostly indirectly via elastic Rayleigh scattering, but, depending on the pump beam profile,

possibly also through overlap of the pump's spatial frequencies with the LP1 dispersion.

Due to the underlying exciton-exciton interactions between LP1 polaritons on the elastic

circle and LP2 polaritons close to k = 0, shown in Fig. 2, the pump can induce a shift of

the LP1 frequencies. As we will show below, the shift is different for "+" and "-" polarized

LP1 states, which is important for the control of the OSHE. For typical parameters, such

as those used in Ref. [82], the shifts are substantial (of order 0.5meV). We stress that in

the present study we stay below the optical parametric oscillation (OPO) threshold. This

is in contrast to our earlier work on polaritonic pattern formation [85], which focused on a

regime above OPO threshold.

III. DOUBLE-CAVITY SPINOR GROSS-PITAEVSKII EQUATIONS

Spinor-valued polaritons in a double cavity are represented by wave functions ψ±

m(r, t)
(where m is LP1 or LP2), which obey driven polaritonic Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The

Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the double cavity are derived in this section. For the single-

cavity case they can be found, for example, in Ref. [86]. In Ref. [85] the double-cavity is

described in terms of the more fundamental equations for the excitonic interband polarization

p and the electric field amplitude E. However, such a general description makes it difficult

to elucidate the nature of the anisotropic ballistic polariton transport and in particular

interaction effects that give rise to an effective magnetic field. The double-cavity polaritonic

Gross-Pitaevskii equations that we derive in the following allow us to identify the effective

magnetic field with the polaritonic wave functions and interactions. Since there is a well-

8

defined relation between the polariton picture and the underlying p and E amplitudes, it is

then possible to provide a quantitative relation between the effective magnetic field and the

power of the incident light field.

The equations of motion for excitons and cavity photon fields in semiconductor quantum

well double microcavities were given in Ref. [85] in a k-space formulation. They consist

of equations for the electric field amplitude at the position of the quantum well within

the quasi-mode approximation and equations for the exciton (specifically the 1s heavy-hole

exciton) component of the interband polarization. In a real-space formulation they read

are the k = 0 energies of the cavity mode and the 1s exciton field, respectively. The two

cavities and quantum wells are assumed to be identical and hence the k = 0 energies of the

two cavities are equal. The cavity photon dispersion is modeled as a parabolic function of

momentum, with different masses, mT E and mT M , for the TE and TM modes, respectively.

H± represents the splitting of the TE and TM photon modes that couples the two circular

polarization channels. mX is the 1s heavy-hole exciton mass, which we treat as infinite in

the range of interest. γC is the cavity loss rate and γX the exciton dephasing. The coupling

strength between excitons and photons in each cavity is ΩX , and the photon fields in the two
cavities are coupled with strength ΩC. R±

pump,2 are the effective pump sources

pump,1 and R±

in cavity 1 and 2, respectively.

The nonlinear couplings between excitons are discussed in detail in Ref. [40]. They contain

two parts: the Pauli blocking (or phase space filling, PSF) among the excitons' Fermionic

constituents (electrons and holes), denoted by APSF, and the effective interactions T ++

9

and T +−, in the co-circularly polarized and counter-circularly polarized exciton channels

[40], respectively. Retardation (quantum memory) effects are neglected due to the quasi-

monochromatic excitation conditions.

Diagonalizing the linear part of Eqs. (2) - (5) one finds two lower polariton branches,

LP1 and LP2, and two upper polariton branches, UP1 and UP2. We denote the polariton

LP 1, ψ±

fields by ψ±

. For clarity, we display the result in a schematic fashion in

Fig. 3c and omit the spin current texture due to phase oscillations of ψ+(r) within the

pump profile in this figure. Pumping spin-up polaritons close to the origin leads to a radial

outward flow of predominantly spin-up polaritons due to the polariton's ballistic motion.

However, the spin-orbit coupling results in a reversal of the radial flow in an adjacent ring

of predominantly spin-down polaritons, the two regions being separated by a narrow ring of

tangential spin current (whose magnitude is very small). Increasing the pump source leads

to a deformation of the polarization texture as shown in Fig. 3b.

IV. FAR-FIELD SPIN/POLARIZATION TEXTURE ROTATION

In addition to the real space formulation, we also analyze the results in momentum space.

We perform a Fourier transform of the polariton wave functions and obtain ψ±

LP 1(k), which
determines the off-axis emission related to the occupation of the elastic circle, and define the

Stokes parameters, i.e. the pseudo-spin, in terms of the LP1 wave functions. The S1 compo-

nent of the k-dependent pseudo-spin vector is, without conventional normalization denomi-

LP 1(k)2−ψy

nator, S1(k) = ψx
S1(k)/[ψx
and furthermore, S2(k) = −2Im[ψ−∗

LP 1(k)2 + ψy

LP 1(k)2. With that normalization included, it reads S(n)
LP 1(k)ψ+

LP 1(k)2]. Alternatively, we can write S1(k) = 2Re[ψ−∗

1 (k) =
LP 1(k)],

LP 1(k)ψ+

LP 1(k)] and S3(k) = ψ+

LP 1(k)2 − ψ−

LP 1(k)2.

We note that, because of its definition in terms of squared wave functions, the pseudo-

spin vector in wave vector space, that enters the torque equation discussed above, is not

the spatial Fourier transform of the configuration space pseudo-spin vector, so e.g. the 1-

component S1(r) without normalization denominator is not the Fourier transform of S1(k).
The normalized S(n)

X (Y) polarization for a Gaussian pump pulse with diameter 50 µm (FWHM in intensity). Here,

the data are normalized such that the maximum (minimum) value of S1(k) on the elastic circles

is +1 (-1). The function S1(k) contains information about the linear polarization seen in the far

field emission. Low excitation power shown in (a), high power with an exciton density of 164 µm−2

circularly ("+") polarized source, the steady-state linear polarization texture in momentum

space, S1(k), is shown in Fig. 4a. It exhibits the linear OSHE effect, in agreement with Fig.

1. Since quasi-monochromatic pumping occupies only states on the (hardly distinguishable)

elastic circles of the TE and TM modes, the polarization texture is restricted to the vicinity

of the circles. Increasing the pump intensity yields a rotation of the polarization textures as

shown in Fig. 4b, again in agreement with the expectations of Fig. 1d.

In order to quantitatively determine the rotation of the far-field spin/polarization texture,

we average each term entering the k-dependent Stokes parameter along the radial direction

over the ring that includes the elastic circles of both the TE and TM modes, and denote

14

the average as hψx/y

LP 1(k)2i, which is a function of the polar angle φk, which from now on
we denote simply by φ. We can now use these radial averages in the definition of the Stokes
parameters, in particular S1, and obtain a Stokes parameter, denoted by ¯S1(φ), that depends
only on φ. We could see from the numerical results presented in Fig. 4 that ¯S1(φ) (and the
normalized counterpart ¯Sn

1 (φ)) displays a cos(2φ + Θ) dependence, where Θ is an offset
determined by the pump field characteristics such as pump power. Therefore a rotation of

the far-field pattern with increasing power is equivalent to a power-dependent change of Θ.
To quantify such a rotation, we denote by φ0 the angle at which ¯S1(φ) first vanishes in the
range between 0 to 2π, i.e. ¯S1(φ0) ∼ cos(2φ0 + Θ) = 0, as shown in Fig. 4.

It is desirable to have a simple analytical approximation for the changes of Θ. To this end,

we proceed as follows. We consider the nonlinear coupling effect of polaritons on S1(k), which

is assumed to have LP1 polaritons only on the elastic circles (with k 6= 0). The nonlinear

effect is expected to be dominated by the polaritons on LP2 with the same polarization as
the source, ψ+

LP 2. Therefore, as an approximation that can be validated through comparison
LP 1 to the density in the
polariton interaction term N±,1 in Eq. (6). Under this approximation, the k-space version

where the resonance condition Eq. (24) has been used. It provides an analytical estimate of

the angular rotation of the polarization texture as a function of the LP2 density ψ+

LP 2(r =
0)2 which is created by the "+" polarized pump source. Note that this analytical model is

valid for infinite spot size of the beam. We also note that the angular rotation in Eq. (26)

changes sign if we use a "-" instead of "+" polarized source.

The expression in Eq. (26) allows us to identify the pump-induced B3 component of

the effective magnetic field, which was left as a parameter in the above discussion of the

pseudo-spin model, as

B3 = (2( T ++ + AP SF ) − T +−)ψ+

LP 2(r = 0)2

(27)

From a microscopic point of view, the control of B3 is based here on the interaction be-

tween LP1 and LP2 polaritons, with the LP2 population giving rise to Coulombic and
phase-space filling energy shifts of the two LP1 polariton spin states. Since T ++ and AP SF
are positive and T +− negative, the difference between the shifts due to co-circularly and

counter-circularly polarized states leads to a reinforcement, rather than a cancellation, of

the nonlinear OSHE rotation. We note again that the analytic expression for B3 in Eq. 27

is valid for infinite beam spot size.

One advantage of the microscopic theory developed here is that is allows for a quantitative

estimate of the rotation of the far-field spin/polarization texture as a function of the incident

power. In [82], the simple pseudo-spin model was used to analyze experimental data, but

since B3 is a phenomenological parameter a quantitative power estimate cannot be obtained

from that model. In the following, we show how the present theory can give that estimate

for arbitrary beam spot sizes. Starting from the condition of energy conservation, we have

derived the following relation

Here, pj2 is the exciton density in the j-th quantum well, γrec the electron-hole recombina-

tion rate (describing decay of the exciton density via radiative and non-radiative recombina-

tion), r2 is the reflectance of the doublecavity system, t2 its transmittance, ninc and ntran

are the refractive indexes of the materials on the side of the incident and transmitted beam,

respectively. From numerical transfer matrix simulations we obtain r2 = 0.391, t2 = 0.014

with ninc = 1 and ntran = 3.59. dF W HM is the full-width at half-maximum of the pump

17

intensity with a Gaussian profile, which in the experiment is estimated to be on the order of

50 µm. Since the OSHE rotation is a consequence of excitonic interaction, it is beneficial to

study the rotation as a function of exciton density, not the polariton density (because the

photonic component of the polaritons does not contribute to the rotation). From the theory

outlined above, the pump-induced exciton density of each quantum well is given by

pj2 ≡ p2 = β22ψ+

LP 2(r = 0)2

(29)

which we approximate to be the same for all j (the small differences of the photonic envi-

ronment for the different quantum wells can be ignored for the present approximate power

estimate). The factor β22 is given in Eq. (10). An estimate of the recombination time in our

sample can be obtained from Refs. [88, 89]. For a 20 nm wide (almost bulk-like) quantum

well, Ref. [88] reports a 700 ps radiative exciton lifetime. The difference between lifetimes

in bulk and two-dimensional systems is about a factor of 4, see Ref. [89]. Since the quantum

wells in our sample are thin (7nm) and have large barriers, and are therefore closer to the

two-dimensional limit, we estimate our radiative lifetime to be approximately 700 ps/4, or

between 100 and 200 ps.

Applying these considerations to the case of Ref. [82], we find that for a spot size of 50 µm

and a lifetime (including radiative and non-radiative) of τrec = 92 ps, a power of 40 mW

corresponds to an exciton density of 120 µm−2.

In Fig. 5 we show the orientation φ0 obtained from numerical solutions of the polaritonic

Gross-Pitaevskii equation with finite spot size. In Fig. 5, for fixed exciton density, increasing

the spot size yields a larger rotation of the OSHE pattern. We restrict ourselves here to

Gaussian pulse profiles and moderate densities. A detailed analysis of the OSHE rotation

caused by other pump pulse profiles and over a larger range of densities will be given else-

where. We also note that in the limit of infinite spot size of a Gaussian beam, the numerical

results approach the simple analytical model, Eq. (26).

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have shown that Coulombic interactions between polaritons on the

two lower branches, LP1 and LP2, of a semiconductor double microcavity can be used to

control the spin/polarization patterns in real space (near field) and momentum space (far

field). Using a double-cavity spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we have found in particular

that the far field pattern, which determines the anisotropic ballistic polariton transport,

can undergo a simple rotation as a function of increasing LP2 polariton density. This is in

agreement with recent experimental results. The rotation depends on the spot size of the

excitation beam, and, in the limit of infinite spot size, approaches a simple analytical model,

Eq. (26). The microscopic theory presented here also allows for an identification of the B3

component of a phenomenological pseudo-spin model, which is responsible for the far-field

rotation. The B3 component is shown to be related to the excitonic T-matrix in the co-

and counter-circularly polarized interaction channel as well as the LP2 polariton density,

Eq. (27). Further studies of the dependence of the spin/polarization texture control on the

spatial pump profile and over a wide range of intensities, reaching to the OPO threshold,

will be interesting extensions of the present work.
