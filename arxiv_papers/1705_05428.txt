The vertical configuration is a powerful tool recently developed experimentally to investigate field
effects in quasi 2D systems. Prototype graphene-based vertical tunneling transistors can achieve an
extraordinary control over current density utilizing gate voltages. In this work we study theoreti-
cally vertical tunneling junctions that consist of a monolayer of photo-switchable aryl-azobenzene
molecules of sandwiched between two sheets of graphene. Azobenzene molecules transform between
trans and cis conformations upon photoexcitation, thus adding a second knob that enhances control
over physical properties of the junction. Using first-principles methods within the density func-
tional framework, we perform simulations with the inclusion of field effects for both trans and cis
configurations. We find that the interference of interface states resulting from molecule-graphene
interactions at the Fermi energy introduces a dual-peak pattern in the transmission functions and
dominates the transport properties of gate junctions, shedding new light on interfacial processes.

Introduction.

In miniaturizing metal-oxide-semi-
conductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) to sub-
5 nm size, one encounters severe challenges in preserv-
ing system performance and reliability [1], and one must
rely on new physics emerging from nano-scale material
systems to overcome this obstacle. The vertical integra-
tion of tunneling field effect transistors (TFETs) based
on the stacking of two-dimensional (2D) layered materi-
als has been explored as an alternative transistor archi-
tecture in recent years [2 -- 6]. Vertical TFETs stacking
layers of graphene with 2D insulators and semiconduc-
tors such as hexagonal BN and transition-metal dichalco-
genides have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary
control of the tunneling current via gate voltages [4, 5, 7].
Equally if not more important, the vertical configuration
introduces a technique to approach fundamental physics
processes at interfaces, an emergent area in materials,
chemical, and condensed matter physics [8 -- 10].

When the thickness of a system is of nano-scale, in-
terfacial physics governs the electronic, magnetic and
transport properties. For instance the h-BN graphene
interface is electrostatically sharp [7], while the dielec-
tric response of WS2 is greatly affected by interface with
graphene [11]. Interface physics is in general not limited
to nano-scale materials; interfaces between two bulk sys-
tems or between a bulk material and vacuum or air can
also trigger emergent phenomena. Examples include the
two-dimensional electron gas at a LaAlO3  SrTiO3 inter-
face [12] and the protected surface states of the celebrated
topological insulators [13]. Nano-structured 2D systems,
which have bulk 2D extent but are finite in the third di-
mension, provide unique opportunities for investigating
and understanding interfacial processes.

The subject of this study is TFETs based on graphene
and organic materials. Recent advances in fabricating
hybrid nano-scale heterostructures have made it possi-
ble to incorporate organic molecules in the design of
vertical TFETs. Covalent bonds between molecules
and graphene can form via dediazoniation [14, 15].
It

was proposed that such bonds enhance the flexibility of
graphene molecule graphene junctions [16]. The gate-
voltage tunable transport through graphene molecule
interfaces has been attributed to modulation of the
Schottky barriers at the interface [17 -- 19]. Organic
molecules offer the advantage over inorganic materials
that their properties can be modified by substituting var-
ious ligands;
in particular, photo-switchability can be
incorporated by inserting azobenzene ligands [16, 20 -- 
23] that can switch between trans or cis conformations.
Electronic, magnetic and photoelectronic properties of
molecules on graphene have been studied previously [24 -- 
26]. In this work we investigate theoretically the interface
states at graphene azobenzene(containing) graphene
nano-junctions and the emerging phenomena when gate
voltage is turned on. Combined with optical control over
the trans and the cis forms of azobenzene molecules, we
propose a multi-control charge transport process and the
underlying physical origin.

Computational Methods. Calculations were carried
out using density functional theory (DFT). The geome-
tries of graphene trans graphene (Gr trans Gr) and
graphene cis graphene (Gr cis Gr) were fully opti-
mized using the VASP package [27, 28]. The residual
forces on atoms are smaller than 0.01 eV/ A after relax-
ation. The weak interactions between molecules and the
top graphene layer were treated by using the van der
Waals density functional [29, 30]. Within the generalized
gradient approximation parameterized by Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof [31], the electronic structure and transport
properties were calculated using the SIESTA package,
[32] based on Troullier-Martins norm-conserving pseu-
dopotentials [33] and a pseudo-atomic orbital basis set.
The electrostatic interaction was treated by the effec-
tive screening medium (ESM) approach [34] that solves
the Hartree potential with non-periodic boundary con-
ditions, and we recently adopted the ESM method to
simulate gate effects [7, 35]. Positive gate voltages Vg
induce extra electrons into the Gr molecule Gr system.

anchored at the bottom graphene layer by a C-C bond
and the contact with the top graphene layer is of van
der Waals nature. The leftmost and rightmost graphene
regions serve as source and drain.

The curved part of the left graphene sheet follows the
description in Ref. 36, where it was shown that electrons
encounter little scattering. This configuration mimics the
experimental configuration, and gate voltages are guar-
anteed to induce the same potential shift on source and
drain. The equilibrium Green's function and transmis-
sion probability were calculated from the Hamiltonian
using well-established procedure [37].
Results. Transmission of Gr molecule Gr junctions
depends on the conformation (trans and cis) of the
molecule, and can be modulated by gate voltage, as
shown in Fig. 2. The Gr trans Gr junction has a
transmission almost symmetric with respect to nega-

tive and positive gate-voltage, while transmission of the
Gr cis Gr junction is much enhanced by positive gate
voltages. With no gate voltage, the different conduc-
tance of azobenzene containing molecules with trans and
cis conformations was attributed to the difference in their
lengths [16], different couplings to electrodes [38], and
different tunneling pathways [39]. The astonishing gate
effect as seen in Fig. 2 on the transmission reveals new
physics that requires explanation.

Electronic transport through molecules is usually gov-
erned by molecular orbitals, especially the highest oc-
cupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoc-
cupied molecular orbital (LUMO), those closest to the
Fermi energy. Transmission by a molecular orbital ex-
hibits a Lorentzian peak centered at approximately its

with the gate voltage (arrows in Fig. 4). Peaks in trans-
mission close to the Fermi energy are responsible for
the Gr trans Gr junction showing a higher transmis-
sion than the Gr cis Gr junction at positive gate voltage
(Fig. 2). Near the Fermi energy, these emergent peaks
cannot be explained by molecular orbitals, which are far
away from the Fermi energy.

Do these peaks correspond to states emerging from
molecule-graphene or molecule-molecule interactions at
the interface? We looked into the electronic structure to
identify the states responsible for the transmission peaks
near the Fermi energy. With this question in mind we
built periodic structures of Gr trans Gr and Gr cis Gr
whose unit cells are shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Band
structures of Gr trans Gr and Gr cis Gr are shown in
Fig. 5 (a2) and (b2). The strongly dispersive bands span-
ning the whole energy range come from graphene layers.
The bands contributed by the top graphene layer (bonded
to molecule via van der Waals interaction) are highlighted
in blue to distinguish them from those of the bottom
graphene layer. The Dirac point of both graphene lay-
ers is 0.15 eV above the Fermi energy, and both of them
are hole doped due to charge transfer with molecules.
The molecular orbitals show up as nearly flat bands due
to the large distances (∼ 7 A) among molecules. The
LUMO corresponds to the dispersionless band at 1 eV
above the Fermi energy, while the HOMO falls around
−0.7 eV. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap is 1.74 eV for
trans and 1.90 eV for cis molecules. The HOMO and
LUMO in both trans and cis molecules are localized on
the azobenzene ligand (Fig. 6). For trans molecules, the
HOMO is strongly localized between the two benzene

energy and with width proportional to the strength of
its coupling to electrodes [40, 41]. Both Gr trans Gr
and Gr cis Gr junctions show two peaks in their trans-
mission curves at zero gate voltage (Fig. 3). Peaks at
around −0.7 eV correspond to the molecular HOMO, and
those near 1.0 eV are attributed to the LUMO. The peak
corresponding to the HOMO in trans junctions is nar-
row, which indicates a weaker coupling between this or-
bital and graphene electrodes. The dips in the trans-
mission curves near the Fermi energy are the results of
the small density of states in graphene electrodes. We
also examined the evolution of the transmission curves
of Gr trans Gr and Gr cis Gr junction under different
gate voltages (Fig. 4) as a function of energy. Note that
the energy range in here is smaller than in Fig. 3, and
transmission peaks due to molecular LUMO and HOMO
do not appear in this energy window.

both LUMO and HOMO states. The weak dispersion
of this state contributes a large density of states at the
Fermi energy.
Gate voltages shift the bands of Gr molecule Gr junc-
tions. Band structures at gate voltage of 0Eg = −13.6,
0.0, and 13.6 × 10−3 C/m2 are shown in Fig. 5(a,b).
The molecular LUMO and HOMO states shift towards
lower energy as the gate voltage changes from negative
to positive, although the HOMO-LUMO energy gap re-
mains unchanged. The energy shift of bands from the
top graphene layer is visible by tracing the position of
the Dirac point. These energy shifts are summarized in
Fig. 5(c), where the LUMO state is not plotted because of
its distance from the HOMO state is unchanged. The ef-
fect of gate voltage on the top graphene layer is screened
mainly by the bottom graphene layer. The position of
the Dirac point of the top graphene layer in Gr trans Gr
junction shows the same dependence on gate voltage as
in Gr cis Gr junction [Fig. 5(c)]. The energy shift of the
HOMO in Gr trans Gr is weaker than in cis junction,
which can be explained by the spatial positions of the
molecular orbitals. While the HOMO and LUMO states
of trans molecules are near the center of the junction,
the molecular states of cis molecules are located away
from the bottom graphene layer, so gate voltages have
a weaker influence on the orbitals of cis molecules. The
band due to the C-C interface state is insensitive to gate
voltage because it contributes a large density of states
around the Fermi energy. The bands from the bottom
graphene layer are pinned by the C-C interface state, so
they are also unchanged by gate voltages.

Discussion. We first discuss the connection between
electronic structure and transport properties. Energy
shifts of molecular orbitals in response to gate voltages
are reflected in the transmission curve. A negative gate
voltage raises the HOMO closer to the Fermi energy
(Fig. 5). The enhancement of transmission of Gr cis Gr
junctions at negative energies is due to the tail of the
Breit-Wigner resonance through the HOMO (Fig. 4).
This phenomenon is not observed in trans junctions be-
cause of the strongly localized HOMO. Positive gate volt-
ages lower the LUMO closer to the Fermi energy, which
results in a similar enhancement of transmission at pos-
itive energies. This enhancement only happens in the
cis junction, in which gate voltages more efficiently tune
the energies of molecular orbitals [Fig. 5(c)]. At zero gate
voltage, the contribution of the interface state is canceled
by the low density of states of the graphene leads. Gate
voltage brings the interface state into play by shifting
the Dirac point of graphene layer away from the Fermi
energy. However, the complexity of the resulting voltage
dependence of the transmission curve goes far beyond a
simple shift. The interface state contributes peaks in the
transmission curve around the Fermi energy and domi-
nates the transmission at positive gate voltage (Fig. 4).
Next we discuss the mechanism behind the dual-peak

rings, while the LUMO spreads over the whole azoben-
zene ligand [Fig. 6(a1) and (a3)]. The HOMO and LUMO
of cis molecules have very similar spatial distributions
[Fig. 6(b1) and (b3)].

The state near the Fermi energy can be identified from
the band structure. The weakly dispersive bands cross-
ing the Fermi energy [Fig. 5 (a2) and (b2)] can be traced
to the C-C bond between the molecule and the bottom
graphene layer. The charge density corresponding to
this state mainly resides on the bottom graphene layer
and the phenyl ligand chemically bonded to it; thus it is
an interface state [Fig. 6(a2) and (b2)]. The x-y plane
integrated charge density corresponding to the HOMO,
LUMO and the interface state are plotted along the z-
direction in Fig. 6(c) and (d). The charge density of
the interface state decays exponentially across the whole
molecule, since its energy is within the LUMO-HOMO
gap of the molecule, and the decay rate is faster than

viewed as an evidence against the Fano mechanism, be-
cause none of the global or local channels are killed by
reducing the molecular density.

Conclusion. We studied a vertical field-effect system
consisting of graphene and photo-switchable aryl azoben-
zene molecules. Light irradiation can transform the
molecule between trans and cis conformations. Calcula-
tions demonstrate the simultaneous control of electronic
structure and transport properties by light irradiation
and gate voltages. A gate voltage shifts the positions of
the LUMO and HOMO of molecules and the bands from
graphene. The C-C chemical bonding between molecules
and the bottom graphene layer results in an interface
state at the Fermi energy. This interface state interac-
tions with other C-C bonding states can lead under finite
gate voltage to a strong peak at the Fermi level and there-
fore dominate the transport properties of junctions. The
distinct feature of this junction as shown in the calculated
transmission curves (Fig. 4) illustrates the importance of
interfacial processes and predicts that emergent patterns
in transmission functions can be engineered.

in the transmission curve around the Fermi energy at
positive gate voltage (top panel, Fig. 4). At first glance,
the asymmetric dual-peak is reminiscent of the Fano reso-
nance [42 -- 44], but it was excluded after detailed analysis.
The Fano resonance mechanism involves two conducting
channels separated in energy: a first (background) chan-
nel has an energy far away from the Fano region and a
second (local) channel near the Fano region.
Interfer-
ence between the two channels results in an asymmet-
ric transmission peak, and destructive interference can
lead to a valley between two peaks. To apply Fano's
model to Gr molecule Gr junctions, the interface state
around the Fermi energy can be seen as the local channel.
For the trans junction the molecular LUMO can serve
as the background channel, which contributes transmis-
sion at positive energies. This explanation however fails
for the cis junction, which shows no signature of LUMO
contribution to the transmission at positive energies. A
novel interpretation is needed. We note that the inter-
face state in Figs. 6(a2)(b2) forms a band with a 0.2 eV
width [Figs. 5(a,b)] that is of the same order of magni-
tude as the width of the asymmetric peaks in the trans-
mission. We hypothesize that the asymmetric transmis-
sion peak arises from interference of interface states. If
true, the width and shape of the transmission peak can
be changed by tuning the dispersion and width of the
band corresponding to the interface state. We carried
out supplementary calculations using the same configu-
ration in Fig. 1 but with the density of molecules reduced
by half; the band dispersion of the interface state is thus
also reduced. Calculations show that the width of the
transmission peak is reduced, and more importantly the
dual-peak feature disappears (Fig. 7). This supports our
hypothesis that the asymmetric transmission peak is con-
tributed by the interface state. This result can also be
