Abstract

Quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a highly accurate description of phenomena involving

the interaction of atoms with light. We argue that the quantum theory describing the interaction

of cold atoms with a vibrating membrane -- quantum acoustodynamics (QAD) -- shares many issues

and features with QED. Specifically, the adsorption of an atom on a vibrating membrane can be

viewed as the counterpart to QED radiative electron capture. A calculation of the adsorption

rate to lowest-order in the atom-phonon coupling is finite; however, higher-order contributions

suffer from an infrared problem mimicking the case of radiative capture in QED. Terms in the

perturbation series for the adsorption rate diverge as a result of massless particles in the model

(flexural phonons of the membrane in QAD and photons in QED). We treat this infrared problem in

QAD explicitly to obtain finite results by regularizing with a low-frequency cutoff that corresponds

to the inverse size of the membrane. Using a coherent state basis for the soft phonon final state, we

then sum the dominant contributions to derive a new formula for the multiphonon adsorption rate

of atoms on the membrane that gives results that are finite, nonperturbative in the atom-phonon

coupling, and consistent with the KLN theorem. For micromembranes, we predict a reduction with

increasing membrane size for the low-energy adsorption rate. We discuss the relevance of this to

the adsorption of a cold gas of atomic hydrogen on suspended graphene.

INTRODUCTION

The adsorption process, where a free atom or molecule adheres to the surface of a material,

is central to a variety of phenomena in surface science [1]. Experimental study of adsorption

relies on having clean surfaces and gases at low temperature. Recent experimental advances

in the cooling and manipulation of ultracold atomic beams have opened up a new low-energy

regime of adsorption where models of atom-surface interactions require a complete quantum

mechanical treatment. Furthermore, newly discovered materials such as graphene provide

truly two-dimensional solids where strong low-frequency fluctuations of the surface might

dramatically alter the adsorption dynamics [2].

In addition to its centrality in surface science, it has been proposed that the dynamics

of such a "quantum hybrid" system could be utilized for quantum information processing

[3] or precision measurement [4]. It has been demonstrated that the interactions between a

cold atom and a vibrating membrane can be engineered by placing the system in an optical

cavity [5]. Laser light can be bounced off the membrane to form an optical lattice [6] that

can strongly couple over large distances the motion of the atoms to the vibrational modes

of the membrane. The dynamics of cold atoms with nanotubes and cantilevered beams has

also been studied both experimentally [7, 8] and theoretically [9 -- 11].

Our focus here is the dynamics of a system consisting of a single atom interacting with an

elastic membrane. Such a system can be realized with a cold atom coupled via the van der

Waals (vdW) interaction to a suspended two-dimensional material such as graphene. While

the vdW interaction between a cold neutral atom and graphene is weak, it is sufficiently

strong for a hydrogen atom to bind to graphene at low temperatures. We examine the tran-

sition rate of a cold atom to a bound state on the clamped membrane at zero temperature.

It was previously recognized that there are similarities between the adsorption process

and radiative capture [12, 13]. Our work highlights the fact that quantum adsorption is

a non-relativistic, condensed matter analogue of QED. We essentially study in this work

the phonon analogue to radiative corrections in scattering.

It is interesting to note that

another well-known analogous effect, the phononic Lamb shift, has been detected in a recent

experiment [14] in a related system.

A straightforward perturbative expansion of the adsorption rate in the atom-phonon

interaction has terms that become infrared divergent for macroscopic membrane size. In

2

analogy to the well-known infrared problem in QED [15], we show explicitly that the infrared

divergences in the perturbation expansion of the adsorption rate can be remedied by using an

appropriate set of soft phonon final states and summing over contributions corresponding to

multiphonon emission. We subsequently obtain a closed-form expression for the multiphonon

adsorption rate. The calculated rate is infrared finite, a result consistent with the KLN

theorem [16, 17].

The model was derived previously [2] by assuming that the atom moves slowly in the per-

pendicular direction toward an elastic, clamped membrane under tension and can transfer

energy through force-coupling to the membrane by exciting its circularly symmetric flexural

modes (Fig. 1). The model has linear phonon dispersion with constant transverse speed of

sound.

atom-phonon coupling for an atom bound to the membrane.

If one regards the atom-phonon interactions as perturbations Hi = Hbi + Hki, the ad-

sorption rate can be estimated using Fermi's golden rule. The unperturbed Hamiltonian
H0 = Ha + Hph has eigenstates nk, nb;{nq}(cid:105) labeled by the number of atoms in the contin-
uum nk, the number of atoms bound nb and the number of phonons in each vibrational mode
of the membrane {nq}. The initial state has an atom in the continuum and the membrane

where ρ is a partial phonon density of states for the circularly symmetric vibrational modes

of the membrane. This result, finite in the limit of a large membrane, is of order g2

kb and
is independent of gbb. Higher order contributions in gbb however are divergent in the large

membrane limit where soft phonon emission becomes possible. We use the inverse size of the

membrane  as an infrared regulator that provides a low frequency cutoff to the vibrational

spectrum; ωD is the membrane's high frequency limit.

The KLN theorem [16, 17] informs us that infrared divergences are specious and are
not contained in the true physical adsorption rate as  → 0. Thus, approximations to the
adsorption rate obtained by truncation of this (divergent) perturbation expansion must be

carefully scrutinized for large membranes [18].

If one regroups the Hamiltonian so that Hbi is included in the unperturbed Hamilto-

nian, a quite different result follows for the lowest order adsorption rate. With Hki as the

only perturbation, the remaining terms of H form the unperturbed Hamiltonian which can

perturbation Hki, the adsorption rate Γ1 is given by

We conclude that the adsorption rate for any finite number of phonons emitted is vanishingly

III. SUMMARY

We have studied a quantum model for low-energy atomic adsorption on a 2D membrane.

The strength of the atom-phonon interaction at low frequencies gives rise to an infrared di-

vergence problem in the adsorption rate for large membranes. We use the inverse membrane

GR can be a poor approximation for large membranes where soft phonon processes are important.

size  as a natural IR regulator. With a canonical transformation, we obtain the adsorption

rate in each sector of the phonon Fock space, and we show that each rate vanishes exponen-
tially in the limit of a vanishing cutoff  → 0. We sum the dominant terms in each sector of
the phonon Fock space for small  to obtain a new adsorption rate formula. We show that

the simplest golden rule approximation to the adsorption rate lacks a factor that reduces the
adsorption rate, vanishing slowly as ln−2(ωD/) as  → 0. This prediction might be exper-
imentally tested by comparing the cold atom adsorption rates by samples with membranes

that range up to macroscopic size.

This result provides the answer to the question raised previously [19] concerning the

effect of the IR cutoff on the low-energy sticking of atomic hydrogen on suspended graphene

[20]. It was anticipated [19] that changes in the low-frequency phonon spectrum will have

"little impact" on the sticking process. This logic is used to justify an approximation of

the phonon spectrum that ignores phonons with energies below 0.79 meV. Surprisingly, our

result illustrates that the low-frequency phonon spectrum can have a substantial effect on

the sticking, as the emission of an infinite number of soft phonons can dominate the sticking

of a finite number of quanta facilitates the adsorption. Lastly, we note that this result is in

agreement with previous results based on a variational mean-field method [2, 21, 22] that

find a suppression of the adsorption rate with respect to the simple golden rule rate for

sticking via emission of a finite number of phonons.
