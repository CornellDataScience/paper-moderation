In electronic band structures, nodal lines may arise when two (or more) bands contact and form
a one-dimensional manifold of degeneracy in the Brillouin zone. Around a nodal line, the dispersion
for the energy difference between the bands is typically linear in any plane transverse to the line.
Here, we perform an exhaustive search over all 230 space groups for nodal lines with higher-order
dispersions that can be stabilized by crystalline symmetry in solid state systems with spin-orbit
coupling and time reversal symmetry. We find that besides conventional linear nodal lines, only
lines with quadratic or cubic dispersions are possible, for which the allowed degeneracy cannot be
larger than two. We derive effective Hamiltonians to characterize the novel low-energy fermionic
excitations for the quadratic and cubic nodal lines, and explicitly construct minimal lattice models to
further demonstrate their existence. Their signatures can manifest in a variety of physical properties
such as the (joint) density of states, magneto-response, transport behavior, and topological surface
states. Using ab-initio calculations, we also identify possible material candidates that realize these
exotic nodal lines.

Topological metals and semimetals have been attract-
ing significant interest in current research [1–3]. These
materials feature nontrivial degeneracies in their low-
energy band structures, which give rise to novel fermionic
excitations and lead to fascinating physical properties.
According to the dimension of the degeneracy manifold,
we may have zero-dimensional (0D) nodal points [4–7],
1D nodal lines (NLs), or even 2D nodal surfaces [8–10].
Of these possibilities, the NLs possess rich characteris-
tics. For example, they exhibit a variety of topologi-
cal connections in the Brillouin zone (BZ), such as iso-
lated rings [11, 12],
loops traversing the BZ [13, 14],
nodal chains [15–17], crossed nodal rings [18–20], nodal
nets [21], and Hopf links [22–25]. Depending on the char-
acter of the two contacting bands (electronlike or hole-
like), the NL may also be classified as type-I, type-II, or
hybrid type [14, 26].

There is yet another important characterization to
classify a NL, namely, by the order of energy dispersion
around the line. To illustrate this, consider a NL formed
by the contact between two bands. Around an arbitrary
point K on the line, the effective Hamiltonian takes the
generic form of

Heff(K + q) = w(q) + f (q)σ+ + f∗(q)σ− + g(q)σz, (1)
where σ± = σx ± iσy with σx,y,z the three Pauli matri-
ces, w, f , and g are functions of the small wave-vector
q. Here, we are only concerned with the dispersion in
the plane transverse to the NL, hence q is restricted to

this plane. Also the w term represents an overall energy
shift for both bands, which does not affect the classifi-
cation. Hence, more precisely, the classification is based
on the leading order q-dependence of f and g. Since at
q = 0, f = g = 0, the typical dependence would be
linear, which most NLs discussed to date belong to. Al-
though NLs with quadratic dispersion were noticed in
a few cases [27–29], their symmetry requirement is not
clear. Generally, to have leading-order dispersion beyond
the linear one, it is necessary to require additional sym-
metries, such that their intricate interplay can eliminate
the linear term. Then the natural question to ask is:
Is it possible to have higher-order nodal lines, and what
symmetries protect them?

In this work, we address the above fundamental ques-
tion by showing that higher-order NLs,
including the
quadratic and cubic lines, can be stabilized by crystalline
symmetries. This is done by performing an exhaustive
search over all 230 space groups (SGs) for solid state
systems with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and time re-
versal symmetry (T ). Our key results, as summarized
in Table I, are the following.
(i) NLs with quadratic
and cubic dispersions, hereafter referred to as quadratic
nodal line (QNL) and cubic nodal line (CNL), are the
only stable ones beyond the conventional linear NLs. (ii)
The degeneracy for all the identified higher-order NLs
is two. This means that the corresponding system must
have inversion symmetry (P) broken, otherwise, the dou-
ble degeneracy enforced by PT symmetry for each band
necessarily make the NL (at least) four-fold degenerate.
(iii) All the higher-order NLs are located along the high-
symmetry path through the Γ point, namely, Γ-A path,
which indicates that the corresponding point group sym-
metry for each SG is actually sufficient to stabilize the
NLs. These results are further confirmed and explicitly

irreducible representation and the standard basis function [30], which correspond to the two contacting bands that form the

demonstrated by the constructed effective k·p models and
lattice models. We further show that the higher-order
NLs feature distinct topological charges (Berry phases or
winding numbers), which strongly influence their spec-
tral, transport, and magnetic response properties (see
Table II). We also propose realistic materials which host
such exotic NLs.

Rationale and effective Hamiltonian. We first describe
the working procedure that leads to the result in Ta-
ble I. A higher-order NL must require multiple symme-
tries for its stabilization, so it has to reside on the high-
symmetry paths in the BZ. For each SG, we scan all
the high-symmetry paths, looking for possible band de-
generacies, which can be inferred from the dimensions
of the irreducible representations for the little group on
each path [30]. Here, since SOC is fully considered, we
deal with the double-valued representations, where a 2π-
rotation produces a minus sign and T 2 = −1. Then,
for each irreducible representation with dimension > 1,
we construct the most general symmetry-preserving k · p
Hamiltonian expanded at a generic point on the path,
from which the order of the NL can be directly read off.
This procedure is applied to all the 230 SGs, and the
result is presented in Table I.

As an illustration, let us consider SG 174, which hosts
a QNL along the Γ-A path (chosen as the kz axis). A
generic point K on this path is invariant under the lit-
tle group which contains two generators: the three-fold
rotation C3z and the combined operation T Mz, where
Mz is the reflection with the x-y mirror plane. Since
[C3z,H(K)] = 0, the band eigenstates at K can be si-
multaneously chosen as C3z eigenstates. Consider a basis
state ψ1 corresponding to the Γ4 representation of the
little group, which transforms like 1/2, 1/2i.
It is an
eigenstate of C3z, but is mapped to an orthogonal state
ψ2 ∼ 1/2,−1/2i under T Mz. It follows that {ψ1, ψ2}
gives a protected two-fold degeneracy on Γ-A.
To construct the k · p effective Hamiltonian around K,
we express the symmetry operators in the {ψ1, ψ2} basis:

C3z = ei σz

T Mz = −iσxK,

required to be invariant under the symmetry transforma-
tions, namely,

C3zHeff(R−1

3z q)C−1

3z = Heff(q),

(T Mz)Heff(−q)(T Mz)−1 = Heff(q),

(3)

(4)

where, in line with the discussion for Eq. (1), q is in plane
(qz = 0), and R3z is the three-fold rotation acting on q.
Examining the Taylor series expansion of g(q) in Eq. (1),
we see that all the even-order terms, which are invariant
under the inversion of q, are excluded by Eq. (4) because
{T M, σz} = 0. The linear term in g(q) is also eliminated
by the constraint of Eq. (3), because σz is invariant under
C3z, but R3z rotates q. For the Taylor series of f (q), the
zeroth term vanishes because C3zσ±C−1
3z = e±i2π/3σ±.
To preserve C3 symmetry, the linear term in f (q) must
take the form of cq+σ+ + c∗q−σ−, where q± = qx ± iqy
and c is a constant. However, such linear term is odd
under T Mz, hence it must vanish according to Eq. (4).
Thus, the linear terms in both f and g must vanish, and
the corresponding effective Hamiltonian, to the leading
order, reads

eff (q) = αq2
H174

−σ+ + H.c.,

(5)

where α is a complex parameter that depends on Kz.
(Here and also in Eq. (6), we have omitted the overall
shift term w(q), for it does not affect band crossing.) It is
worth to recall that the Taylor series of g(q)σz begins at
the third order. Hence, the effective Hamiltonian has an
emergent chiral symmetry σz: {H174
eff (q), σz} = 0, which
holds up to the second order of q. Thus, we conclude that
the doubly-degenerate line along Γ-A at leading order is
a QNL with an approximate chiral symmetry.

The analysis for other SGs proceeds in a similar way.
Particularly, for SGs 187-190, an additional mirror sym-
metry is required along with C3z and T Mz. As a result,
the effective Hamiltonians take the same form as Eq. (5),
but here α becomes real for SGs 187 and 188 with Mx,
and purely imaginary for SGs 189 and 190 with My.

For SGs 183-186, the little group is generated by C6z
and Mx. Most interestingly, they host CNLs along Γ-A,
described by

the Pauli matrices with i = x, y, z. The Hamiltonian is

where α and β are real parameters that depend on Kz.
From our search, we find that no higher-order NL beyond
CNL is protected by symmetry, and the degeneracy of all
the identified QNLs and CNLs are two-fold.

To further confirm the existence of the QNLs and
CNLs, we explicitly construct minimal lattice models for
the nine SGs listed in Table I (see Supplemental Material
(SM) [31]). In each case, the lattice model reproduces the
higher-order NL on the Γ-A path, and the model recovers
the corresponding effective Hamiltonians when expanded
around the path.

Topological charge. Conventionally, a nodal line can
be regarded as an infinitely thin "solenoid" with fixed
"magnetic flux" in momentum space, such that an elec-
tron circling around it along a closed path C picks up a
Berry phase similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect [32]:

γC =IC A(q) · dq mod 2π,

(7)

where A is the Berry connection for the occupied bands.
Symmetries such as PT and mirror reflection can quan-
tize γC to be an integral multiple of π. Since a gauge
transformation may change γC by 2π, it represents a Z2
topological invariant, namely, that γC is defined mod 2π.
For the NLs under consideration, the QNLs and CNLs
carry fluxes of 2π and 3π, respectively, hence γC is triv-
ial for the QNLs, and is nontrivial for CNLs (if α 6= β).
On the other hand, as aforementioned, all cases in
Table I have an emergent chiral symmetry σz with
{Heff (q), σz} = 0, which is exact up to the leading order.
We can utilize this chiral symmetry to formulate another
topological invariant [33–35],

which is integer valued. Actually, we have the relation,

For the QNLs, N = 2 to the leading order.

If we
consider the correction due to higher-order terms, for
SG 174, there are terms a(q3

190), only the term a(q3
−)σz] exists,
and N is modified accordingly. For the CNLs in SGs 183-
186, we have N = 3 (−3) if α > β (β > α). The
next order nonvanishing term is ic(q6

a real parameter. The correction of N is proportional
to q6. Therefore, the emergent chiral symmetry is even

Experimental signature. The order of dispersion affects
a variety of physical properties, leading to distinct signa-
tures for the higher-order NLs. Some of these are listed in
Table II and compared with linear NLs and nodal points.
Particularly, the Berry phase can directly manifest
when electrons are forced to circling around the NL un-
der a magnetic field [36]. Consider a B field along the
z direction. In the semiclassical picture, the electron or-
bits in momentum space are quantized according to the
Bohr-Sommerfeld condition,

'2
BACn = 2π(n + ν),

(9)

where 'B = p1/eB is the magnetic length, ACn is the

area enclosed by the semiclassical orbit Cn in k space,
n is an integer corresponding to the Landau level (LL)
index, and the phase offset ν is related to the Berry
phase by ν = 1/2 − γCn /(2π). In experiment, this orbit
quantization leads to quantum oscillations in a variety of
physical properties [37]. For example, the Shubnikov-de
Haas oscillation in magnetoresistance follows the rela-
tion δρxx ∼ cos[2π( F
B − ν)], where F is the oscillation
frequency. Then, the phase offset ν and hence γCn can
be extracted from experimental results by the standard
analysis of the LL fan diagram. According to our dis-
cussion, ν should be 0, 1/2, and 0 for the contribution
from the linear, quadratic, and cubic NL fermions, re-
spectively.

The order of dispersion also affects the scaling of the
LL energy. From Eq. (9), we see that for an m-th order
NL, ACn ∼ k2 ∼ E2/m for energy E, such that the LL
energy scales as εn ∼ (nB)m/2 for large n. We have ver-
ified this relation by a full quantum solution of the LLs
using the effective models in Table I. The unconventional

scaling in the LL spectrum offers another distinguishing
property for higher-order NLs, which can be detected,
e.g., by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measure-
ment. In addition, the order of the NL also determines
the number of zero-energy LLs, where the topological
charge of Eq. (8) plays an essential role as discussed in
SM [31].

There is caveat for the case of CNLs, due to the over-
all shift term w(q). This term, when expanded to third
order for SGs 183-186, takes the form of w0 + w1q2. It
does not affect the classification, but the w1q2 term may
alter the LL scaling in a range where it dominates over
the cubic term, for which the scaling would undergo a
crossover from ∼ (nB)3/2 to ∼ (nB). Similar discussion
applies to the scaling in the density of states. Neverthe-
less, the joint density of states (JDOS), which is crucial
for optical transitions, is not affected by the shift term.
Material realization. To demonstrate that QNLs and
CNLs can indeed exist in real materials, we have searched
the existing materials with the target SGs and identified
a few examples [31]. One example is shown here. It is the
intermetallic ternary compound ZrPtGa, which belongs
to SG 190 [38]. It has trigonal [Pt2Ga6] prisms running
along the c axis, with [Pt2Zr3] hexahedral clusters in-
tercalated in-between [Fig. 1(a,b)]. The calculated band
structure for ZrPtGa (with SOC) is plotted in Fig. 1(d).
One finds that there is a NL along Γ-A with quadratic dis-
persion, more clearly observed in Fig. 1(e) which shows
a zoom-in image for the dispersion (perpendicular to the
NL) around a generic point on the NL. The presence of
this QNL is consistent with our symmetry analysis. The
calculation details and more examples can be found in
SM [31].

Discussion. Some NL materials possess protected sur-
face states. The protection is typically associated with a
quantized π Zak phase, which is the Berry phase defined

FIG. 2. (a) Bulk and surface BZs for SGs 183-186. (b) Bulk
band structure for a lattice model with SG 183. Besides the
CNL along Γ-A, there are three linear NLs along the three
M-L paths, as indicated in (a). (c) shows the corresponding
spectrum for a slab with (010) surfaces. The red color high-
lights the surface states, which span the whole surface BZ, as
indicated in (d). ±π in (d) denote the Zak phase for lines
perpendicular to the (010) surface. The calculation details
are presented in SM [31].

FIG. 3. QNL and CNL under symmetry breaking. Break-
ing (a) C3z or (b) Mz may transform the QNL of SG 187
into two linear NLs or four intertwined linear NLs (black and
green curves), respectively. (c) Breaking Mx may transform

for a straight line crossing the bulk BZ and perpendicu-
lar to the surface. The quantization requires additional
symmetries, such as inversion symmetry or a reflection
symmetry with the mirror plane parallel to the stud-
ied surface. For systems discussed here, we find that
there is no protected surface state for the QNLs. Inter-
estingly, for CNL systems, we find that surface states
exist for the side surfaces, protected by nontrivial Zak
phases with quantization enforced by the perpendicular
mirror planes. Moreover, unlike the usual drumhead-like
surface states [11, 18], these states span over the whole
surface BZ, as illustrated in Fig. 2(c,d).

Finally, as these NLs are protected by symmetry, they
will transform under symmetry breaking. Some interest-
ing cases are illustrated in Fig. 3. For example, breaking
C3z may split the QNL into two linear NLs [Fig. 3(a)];
breaking Mz for SG 174 will generally gap out the QNL,
whereas for SGs 187-190, it may transform the QNL into
four intertwined linear NLs [see Fig. 3(b)]: One linear
NL is along Γ-A, while the other three NLs penetrate
through the BZ once along z and twice along the in-plane

transform a CNL into two triple Weyl points [Fig. 3(c)].
Thus, these systems provide a promising playground for
studying topological phase transitions.

I. DETAILS OF FIRST-PRINCIPLES CALCULATION

We performed the first-principle calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), as implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package [1, 2]. The projector augmented wave method was adopted [3]. The
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) realization [4] was adopted for
the exchange-correlation potential. For all calculations, the energy and force convergence criteria were set to be
10−6 eV and 10−2 eV/A, respectively. The BZ sampling was performed by using k grids with a spacing of 2π × 0.02

A−1 within a Γ-centered sampling scheme. For V12P7, the optimized structure paramemters (a = 9.30 A, c = 3.22

A) were used for the band structure calculation. For the other materials discussed below, the experimental values of
their respective lattice parameters were used in the calculation.

II. MATERIAL CANDIDATES

In the main text, we have shown the result for ZrPtGa, which hosts a QNL along the Γ-A path. Here, we present
a few more examples with the higher-order NLs. The first example is the QNL material V12P7, with the structure in
the space group P ¯6 (No. 174), as illustrated in Fig. S1(a,b). This material is predicted in Materials Project [5]. The
calculated band structure of V12P7 in the presence of SOC is displayed in Fig. S1(d). From the result, one observes a
nodal line along the Γ-A path, about 0.2 eV below the Fermi level. This is a QNL. We purposely show the dispersion
along a path P-Q which is perpendicular to the kz-axis and P (kz = 0.408π) is a generic point on the Γ-A path [see
the right panel of Fig. S1(d)]. The quadratic dispersion is in agreement with our symmetry analysis in the main text.

The second example is the QNL material ZrRuAs, which has a crystal structure with the space group of P ¯62m
(No. 189) shown in Fig. S2(a) and S2(b). In the band structure for ZrRuAs (with SOC) plotted in Fig. S2(d), one
observes that a nodal line exists about 0.5 eV above the Fermi level along the Γ-A path. The dispersion along a
generic path P-Q around the nodal line (where P is a generic point kz = 0.41π on Γ-A) is shown in the right panel of
Fig. S2(d). The analysis shows that it is a QNL.

(kz = 0.222π) on the Γ-A path along the path Q-P-Q which is perpendicular to Γ-A path.

The third example is the CNL material CaAgBi, with the space group of P 63mc (No. 186). It has been synthesized
in experiment [8]. As shown in Figs. S3(a) and S3(b), the Ag and Bi atoms form a Wurtzite lattice with encapsulated
Ca atoms. The calculated band structure for CaAgBi (with SOC included) is plotted in Fig. S3(d). Along the Γ-A
path, we finds a CNL (marked with blue in the Figure), with the two-dimensional irreducible representation Γ9 of the
C6v double group. By examining the band dispersion around a generic point (such as kz = 0.222π) along the Γ-A
path [see the right panel of Fig. S3(d)], we find that the dispersion is indeed cubic, consistent with our symmetry
analysis.

III. DERIVATION OF EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN

Here, we present the derivation of the effective Hamiltonians (shown in the main text) in more detail.

A. SG 174

As discussed in the main text, for SG 177, the symmetry constraints for a point K on Γ-A are from C3z and T Mz.

In the basis corresponding to Γ4 and Γ5 representation [10, 11], the symmetry operators are represented by

C3z = eiσzπ/3,

T Mz = −iσxK,

B. SGs 187-190

Space groups 187-190 have point group D3h. The little group on Γ-A is C3v, for which the generators can be
chosen as C3z and a vertical mirror Mx(y) for SGs 187-188 (SGs 189-190) [10]. Moreover, there also exists the
combined symmetry T Mz. The relevant degenerate basis are those of the Γ4 representation, which transform like
by

2i(cid:9) under the symmetry operation [10, 11]. For SGs 187-188, the symmetry operations are represented

C3z = eiσzπ/3, Mx = −iσx,

where wi and α are real parameters that depend on K. Note that α becomes real in order to preserve the additional
symmetry Mx, compared with the case of SG 174. Still because of the additional Mx, only the first term of Eq. (S3)
remains.

For SGs 189-190, instead of Mx, we have My = −iσy, and then the effective model (up to second order) reads

(q) = w0 + w1q2 + iαq2

C. SGs 183-186

Space groups 183-186 have the same point group C6v. The little group on Γ-A has the generators C6z and a mirror
plane Mx. The relevant basis are those corresponding to the Γ9 representation of the little group, which transform

IV. DERIVATION OF MINIMAL LATTICE MODELS

To further demonstrate the existence of QNLs and CNLs, we explicitly construct minimal lattice (tight-binding)
models for the nine SGs listed in Table I of the main text. Here, we follow the method by Wieder and Kane [13].
The procedure is to write down the representations for the group generators at Γ (including their operations on the
wave-vector k), and then enumerate all the symmetry-allowed hopping terms up to a specified lattice range.

Since QNLs and CNLs predicted here are all formed by two bands, the minimal lattice models would be two-band
models for the SGs with only symmorphic symmetry operations, namely for SGs 174, 183, 187 and 189. On the
other hand, the minimal lattice models for SGs 184-186, 188, and 190 are four-band models, as the corresponding
non-symmorphic symmetries entangle bands in group of four for these space groups [14].

Specifically, we consider the model defined on an AA-stacked hexagonal lattice, as shown in Fig. S4. For (non-
)symmorphic SGs, each unit cell contains a single site (two sites) denoted by the blue ball(s), and each site has an
s-like orbital with two spin states. The gray-colored balls represent sites that do not directly enter the lattice model
(because the corresponding orbitals are at high energy), but they affect the hopping amplitudes between the active
(blue-colored) sites in a way that follows the SG symmetry. For simplicity, we assume that the lattice constants
(a, b, c) for symmorphic SGs are the same c = a = b, whereas for non-symmorphic SGs are related by c = 2a = 2b.

In the following models, we use two sets of Pauli matrices σi and τi to denote operators acting on spin and sublattice
spaces, respectively. σ0 and τ0 both represent the 2 × 2 identity matrix. All the parameters used in the following
models are real.

A. SG 174

The lattice Hamiltonian for SG 174 is constrained by the following symmetries: C3z, Mz, and T . With two basis

for which we have enumerated all symmetry-allowed terms up to the fourth-neighbor hopping. Expanding this model
around the Γ-A path, we recover the effective Hamiltonian for QNLs in the main text.

V. ZERO LANDAU LEVELS FOR HIGHER-ORDER NL

The topological charge N defined in the main text also determines the number of zero Landau levels (LLs) for the
effective model Heff. This result has been proved in Ref. [15]. Here, we have already derived the result explicitly for
Heff for QNLs and CNLs in Table I of the main text. To get the Hamiltonian with magnetic field, we simply replace
q± by a† and a, respectively, where a† and a are boson operators corresponding to the cyclotron-motion under a
magnetic field. For instance, Heff for the QNL in SG 174 has topological charge N = 2, hence the number of zero LLs
LL = αa2σ+ + H.c., for which 0,↓i and 1,↓i are two degenerate
is accordingly two. Indeed, the Hamiltonian is H174
states with zero energy. It is also worth noting that higher-order terms that break the emergent chiral symmetry for
Heff will not remove the zero LLs but will generally split the degeneracy and shift the LLs from zero energy.

VI. CALCULATION DETAILS FOR FIG. 2 OF MAIN TEXT

In Fig. 2 of the main text, we studied the surface states of a lattice model corresponding to SG 183 which contains a
CNL. The model we take is Eq. (S17) which we derive for SG 183. In calculating the bulk and surface band structures
in Fig. 2, we take the following model parameters: t1 = 0.1, t2 = 0.01, t3 = −0.04, t4 = 0.004, t5 = 0.2, tSO
1 = −4,
2 = −3.85, tSO
tSO
4 = 0.77. The calculation in Fig. 2(c) is performed for a slab with a thickness of 35
layers of lattice sites.

3 = −0.8 and tSO

VII. CALCULATION DETAILS FOR FIG. 3 OF MAIN TEXT

Here we present the calculation details for Fig. 3 of the main text. In Fig. 3(a), we consider breaking C3z for a
system that contains a QNL. Here, to be specific, we take the lattice model Eq. (S34) for SG 187, and break the C3z
symmetry by adding a perturbation term

∆H = δtSO

sin kz σx.

(S50)

Then we find that the QNL is split into two linear NLs schematically shown in Fig. 3(a).

In Fig. 3(b), we again take the model Eq. (S34) for SG 187, and break the Mz symmetry by adding the the following

perturbation term

Then we find that the QNL is transformed to four intertwined linear NLs as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3(b).

In Fig. 3(c), we consider breaking the vertical mirror for a system with CNL. First, we show that generally the CNL
will be gapped and there will appear a triple Weyl point at Γ. This can be done by constructing a k · p Hamiltonian
that up to the third order, the effective Hamiltonian reads

around the Γ point with the remaining symmetry constraints of C3z and T . In the basis of(cid:8) 3

y, K+ = (kx + iky)3 + (kx − iky)3 and K− = i(cid:2)(kx + iky)3 − (kx − iky)3(cid:3). One can check that

k + dm,3k2

such Weyl point possesses a cubic dispersion in the kx-ky plane and a linear dispersion in the kz direction, and it
carries a Chern number of ±3. This is verified by the lattice model calculation. We take the model (S17) for SG 183,
and add a perturbation term

where kk =qk2

x + k2

2 , 3

which breaks the Mx symmetry. Then we indeed find that there are two triple Weyl points located at Γ and at A, as
illustrated in Fig. 3(c) of the main text.
