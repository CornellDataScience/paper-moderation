We study the classical thermal component of Casimir, or van der Waals, forces between point
particles with highly anharmonic dipole Hamiltonians when they are subjected to an external electric
field. Using a model for which the individual dipole moments saturate in a strong field (a model that
mimics the charges in a neutral, perfectly conducting sphere), we find that the resulting Casimir
force depends strongly on the strength of the field, as demonstrated by analytical results. For a
certain angle between external field and center to center axis, the fluctuation force can be tuned and
suppressed to arbitrarily small values. We compare the forces between these anharmonic particles
to those between harmonic ones, and also provide a simple formula for asymptotically large external
fields, which we expect to be generally valid for the case of saturating dipole moments.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Neutral bodies exhibit attractive forces, called van der
Waals or Casimir forces depending on context. The earli-
est calculations were formulated by Casimir who studied
the force between two metallic parallel plates [1], and
generalized by Lifshitz [2] for the case of dielectric ma-
terials. Casimir and Polder found the force between two
polarizable atoms [3]. Although van der Waals forces
are only relevant at small (micron scale) distances, they
have been extensively measured, see e.g. [4, 5]. With re-
cent advances in measurement techniques, including the
MEMS framework [6], Casimir-Polder forces become ac-
cessible in many other interesting conditions.

Due to the dominance of van der Waals forces in
nanoscale devices, there has been much interest in con-
trolling such forces. The full Lifshitz theory for van der
Waals forces [2] shows their dependence on the electri-
cal properties of the materials involved. Consequently
the possibility of tuning a material's electric properties
opens up the possibility of tuning fluctuation-induced in-
teractions. This principle has been demonstrated in a
number of experimental set-ups, for instance by chang-
ing the charge carrier density of materials via laser light
[7, 8], as well as inducing phase transformations by laser
heating, which of course engenders a consequent change
in electrical properties [8]. There is also experimental ev-
idence of reduction of van der Waals forces for refractive
index-matched colloids [9, 10]. The question of forces
in external fields, electric and magnetic, has been stud-
ied in several articles [11 -- 18]. When applying external
fields, nonlinear materials (which exhibit "nonlinear op-
tics") open up a variety of possibilities; these possibili-
ties are absent in purely linear systems where the exter-
nal field and fluctuating field are merely superimposed.
Practically, metamaterials are promising candidates for
Casimir force modulation, as they can exhibit strongly
nonlinear optical properties [19, 20] and their properties
can be tuned by external fields [21]. The nature and de-
scription of fluctuation-induced effects in nonlinear sys-
tems is still under active research [22 -- 25]. For exam-

ple, in Ref. [25], it was shown that nonlinear properties
may alter Casimir forces over distances in the nanoscale.
However, in the presence of only a small number of ex-
plicit examples, more research is needed to understand
the possibilities opened up by nonlinear materials.

In this manuscript, we consider an analytically solv-
able model for point particles with strongly nonlinear
(anharmonic) properties. This is achieved by introduc-
ing a maximal, limiting value for the polarization of the
particles, i.e., by confining the polarization vector in an-
harmonic potential wells. Casimir forces in such systems
appear to be largely unexplored, even at the level of two
particle interactions. We find that strong external elec-
tric fields can be used to completely suppress the Casimir
force in such systems. We discuss the stark difference of
forces compared with the case of harmonic dipoles and
give an asymptotic formula for the force in strong ex-
ternal fields, which we believe is valid in general if the
involved particles have a maximal value for the polariza-
tion (saturate). In order to allow for analytical results,
we restrict our analysis to the classical (high tempera-
ture) limit. However, similar effects are to be expected
in quantum (low temperature) cases.

We start by computing the Casimir force for harmonic
dipoles in an external field in section II, where in Sec.
II B, we discuss the role of the angle between the field and
the center to center axis. In section III A we introduce
the nonlinear (anharmonic) well model and compute the
Casimir force in an external field in section III C. We
finally give an asymptotic expression for high fields in
section III D.

II. FORCE BETWEEN HARMONIC DIPOLES

IN A STATIC EXTERNAL FIELD

A. Model

Classical van der Waals forces can be described by use
of quadratic Hamiltonians describing the polarization of
the particles involved [26 -- 28]. We introduce the system

comprising of two dipole carrying particles having the
Hamiltonian,

− pi · E,

H (h)

i =

Hint = −2kh3(cid:16)p1 · R(cid:17)(cid:16)p2 · R(cid:17) − p1 · p2i ,

where pi is the instantaneous dipole moments of parti-
cle i. α denotes the polarizability, where for simplicity
of presentation, we choose identical particles. The exter-
nal, homogeneous static electric field E couples to pi in
the standard manner. The term Hint describes the non-
retarded dipole-dipole interaction in d = 3 dimensions
with the coupling constant

2

In this series, the first term is of order R−4, while the
second is of order R−7. The external electric field induces
finite (average) dipole moments. For an isolated particle,
this is (index 0 denoting an isolated particle, or k = 0)

hpii0 = R d3pi exp (−βHi) pi
R d3pi exp (−βHi)

.

(8)

For the case of harmonic particles, Eq. (2), this naturally
gives

hpii0 = αE.

(9)

The mean dipole moments of the isolated particles in
Eq. (9), induced by the external electric field, give rise to
a force decaying with R−4, i.e., the first term in Eq. (7).
This can be made more explicit by writing

k =

1

4πε0

R−3,

(4)

(cid:18) ∂kZ
Z (cid:19)k=0

= 2 hp1i0 · hp2i0

where R = R with R the vector connecting the centers
of the two dipoles, while R denotes corresponding unit
vector. Since we are considering purely classical forces,
retardation is irrelevant. ε0 is the vacuum permittivity,
and we use SI units. Inertial terms are irrelevant as well
and have been omitted. (Since the interaction does not
depend on, e.g., the change of pi with time, inertial parts
can be integrated out from the start in the classical set-
ting.)

B. Casimir force as a function of the external field

The force F for the system given in Eqs. (1)-(3) can be
calculated from (as the external electric field is station-
ary, the system is throughout in equilibrium)

− 6(cid:16)hp1i0 · R(cid:17)(cid:16)hp2i0 · R(cid:17) .

(10)

Representing a force decaying with R−4, this term dom-
inates at large separations. From Eq. (10), the depen-
dence on the angle between E and R becomes appar-
ent. The induced force can be either attractive (e.g.
R k E) or repulsive (e.g. R ⊥ E) [29]. We are aim-
ing at reducing the Casimir force through the electric
field, and thus, term by term, try to obtain small prefac-
tors. The considered term ∼ R−4 is readily reduced by
choosing R · E = 1√3
, for which this term is exactly zero,
(cid:0) ∂kZ
Z (cid:1)k=0 = 0. See the inset of Fig. 1 for an illustration.

In the following sections we will thus study the behavior
of the term ∼ R−7 as a function of the external field,
keeping this angle thoughout.

The discussion up to here, including Eq. (11), is valid
generally, i.e., for any model describing the individual
dipoles. For the case of harmonic dipoles, i.e., for Eq. (2),
for this case
yields a result which is partly familiar from the case of
harmonic dipoles in the absence of external fields (de-
noted F0),

dipoles, which describes saturation. A parabola of curvature

α−
we simplify even further by letting the polarizability α tend
to infinity, so that the potential of Eq. (17) is approached.
Physically, α → ∞ means α ≫ βP 2.

As we aim to study the effect of saturation, while keep-
ing the number of parameters to a minimum, we addi-
tionally take the limit α → ∞. This yields an infinite well
potential (see the lower curves of Fig. 2 for the approach
of this limit),

Such models have been studied extensively in different
contexts, as, e.g, asymmetric quantum wells of various
shapes [30 -- 32], two-level systems with permanent dipole
moments [33], and dipolar fluids [34]. These systems are
also known to be tunable with an external electric field
[35, 36]. However the Casimir effect has not been inves-
tigated.

This model for example mimics free electrons confined
to a spherical volume, such as in a perfectly conduct-
ing, neutral sphere. The charge distribution in a sphere
has, additionally to the dipole moment, higher multipole
moments, e.g. quadrupolar. For a homogenous external
field, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (14) is however precise, as
higher multipoles couple to spatial derivatives (gradients)
of the field [29], and only the dipole moment couples to
a homogeneous field. Also, the interaction part, Eq. (3),
contains in priciple terms with higher multipoles. These
do however play no role for the force at the order R−7.

B. Polarization and polarizability

We start by investigating the polarization of an indi-
vidual particle as a function of the field E, resulting from
Eq. (14), which is defined in Eq. (8). It can be found an-

tion of the strength of a static external field. The angle be-
tween the field and the center-to-center vector R is chosen
ϕ = arccos (cid:16) 1
4 then van-
ishes, so that the force decays as ∼ R−

√3(cid:17). The "deterministic" force ∼ R−

7.

Again, for zero field, E → 0, this is in agreement with
the Casimir-Polder force in the classical limit [26], given
by F0. As the field is applied, the force increases, be-
ing proportional to E2 for αβE2 ≫ 1. This is due to
interactions of a dipole induced by the E-field with a
fluctuating dipole (compare also (34) below). The term
proportional to E2 is naturally independent of T . The
force as a function of external field is shown in Fig. 1.

The Casimir force given by Eq. (12) is thus tunable
through the external field, but it can only be increased
due to the square power law. While this might be useful
for certain applications, we shall in the following inves-
tigate the case of highly nonlinear particles. The fact
that the force in Eq. (13) is proportional to α2 suggests
that reduction of the force could be achieved, if the po-
larizabilities were dependent on the external field. In the
next section, we will investigate a model for saturating
particle dipole moments, where indeed the forces can be
suppressed.

III. FORCE BETWEEN SATURATING

DIPOLES IN AN EXTERNAL FIELD

A. Model: Infinite wells

The response of a harmonic dipole to an external field
is by construction linear for any value of the field (see
Eq. (9)), and the polarization can be increased without
bound. We aim here to include saturation by introducing
a limit P for the polarization, such that pi < P at all
times and for all external fields. This can be achieved by
modifying the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2), asigning an infinite
value for pi > P . The potential for pi obtained in such
a way is illustrated in Fig. 2.

is defined through the linear response,

αij =

∂ hpii
∂Ej

.

(18)

Note that this derivative is not necessarily taken at zero
field E, so that αij is a function of E. Indices i and j
denote the components of vectors (in contrast to previous
notation). The polarizability tensor as defined in Eq. (18)
is measured in the absence of any other particle (in other
words, at coupling k = 0). αij can be deduced directly
from the function Q in Eq. (16). In general, we can write

αij (β, E, P ) = Aij (βEP ) α0.

(19)

Recall the zero-field polarizability α0 ≡ 1
5 βP 2 (Eq. (17)).
For the isolated particle, the only special direction is pro-
vided by the external field E, and it is instructive to
examine the polarizability parallel and perpendicular to
it. As mentioned, these are related to Q, and the corre-
sponding dimensionless amplitudes Ak and A⊥ are,

(16)

Note that the product βEP is dimensionless. For a small
external field, we find the average polarization is given by

Ak (x) = 5

A⊥ (x) = 5

(20)

(21)

The amplitudes for parallel and perpendicular polariz-
ability are also shown in Fig. 3. The direct connection
with the polarization is evident. For small fields, where
the polarization grows linearly, the polarizability is inde-
pendent of E. Analytically,

hpii0 =

1
5

βP 2E + O(cid:0)E3(cid:1) .

(17)

We hence observe, as expected, that for small field
the particles respond harmonically, with a polarizability
α0 ≡ 1
5 βP 2. This polarizability depends on temperature,
as it measures how strongly the particles' thermal fluctu-
ations in the well are perturbed by the field. We may now
give another interpretation of the limit α → 0 in Fig. 2:
in order to behave as a "perfect" well, the curvature, given
by α−1 must be small enough to fulfill α ≫ α0.

P

The normalized polarization (i.e. Q (βEP ) =

hpii0
)
is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of external field. For
small values of E, one sees the linear increase, according
to Eq. (17). In the large field limit, the polarization in-
deed saturates to P E. The dimensionless axis yields the
relevant scale for E, which is given through (βP )−1. At
low temperature (or large P ), saturation is approached
already for low fields, while at high temperature (or low
P ), large fields are necessary for saturation.

x2 + O(cid:0)x3(cid:1) .

For large fields, i.e., when βEP is large compared to
unity, the polarizability reduces due to saturation effects.
Asymptotically for large fields, the polarizability ampli-
tudes are given as

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

Ak (x) = 10x−2 + O(cid:0)x−3(cid:1) ,
A⊥ (x) = 5x−1 − 10x−2 + O(cid:0)x−3(cid:1) .

The parallel polarizability αk falls off as E−2 and the
parallel polarizability α⊥ as E−1. The different power
laws may be expected, as near saturation, changing the
dipoles direction is a softer mode compared to changing
the dipoles' absolute value.

Another important quantity related to the polarization
is the polarizability, which is a measure of how easy it is
to induce or change a dipole moment in a system. For
harmonic particles, it is independent of external fields
(see Eq. (9)). In the case of anharmonic particles, the
field-dependent polarizability tensor αij is of interest. It

with the interaction potential Hint given in Eq. (3). The
discussion in section II regarding the angle of the external
field holds similarly here, i.e., Eq. (11) is valid. The force
decaying as R−4 hence vanishes for the angle R · E =
1√3
and we continue by studying the R−7 term at this
angle. Using Eq. (11), the Casimir force can be found
analytically,

Fw = fw (βEP ) F0 + O(R−10),

[x cosh (x) − sinh (x)]2

Again, α0 ≡ 1
5 βP 2 is the zero-field polarizability (see Eq.
(17)).The force is most naturally expressed in terms of
F0, which is the force at zero-field, equivalent to Eq. (13).
The amplitude fw is then dimensionless and depends, as
the polarization, on the dimensionless combination βEP .
The force is shown in Fig. 4. For zero external fields,
the curve starts at unity by construction, where the force
is given by F0. The force initially increases for small
values of βEP , in accordance with our earlier analysis
of harmonic dipoles. After this initial regime of linear

response, the Casimir force decreases for βEP & 1, and,
for βEP ≫ 1, asymptotically approaches zero with E−1,

Fw = −

48P 3

(4πε0)2 R−7E−1 + O(cid:0)E−2(cid:1) .

(31)

This behavior yields enormous potential for applications:
by changing the external field, the force can be switched
on or off.

The asymptotic law in Eq. (31) gives another intrigu-
ing insight:
for large field, the force is independent of
temperature. This is in contrast to the fact that (classi-
cal) fluctuation induced forces in general do depend on
temperature. This peculiar observation is a consequence
of cancellations between factors of β, and might yield fur-
ther possibilities for applications. This is demonstrated
in Fig. 5. Indeed, we see that for small values of E, the
force does depend on temperature, while for large fields,
the curves for different values of temperature fall on top
of each other. As a remark, we note that F0 is inversely
proportional to temperature, in contrast to F0 for har-
monic particles in Eq. (13). This is because the zero
field polarizability depends on temperature for the well
potentials considered here.

D. Asymptotic formula for high fields

What is the physical reason for the decay of the force
for large field E observed in Fig. 4? For large values of
βEP , the force may be seen as an interaction between
a stationary dipole and a fluctuating one. This is cor-
roborated by a direct computation of the force between
a stationary dipole q, pointing in the direction of the

electric field, and a particle with Hamiltonian

(32)

where "perpendicular" and "parallel" refer to the direc-
tion of the E field as before. The two such hypothetical
particles interact via the Hamiltonian

H (s)

int = −2kh3(cid:16)p · R(cid:17)(cid:16)q · R(cid:17) − p · qi .

(33)

Choosing the angle between R and E as before, we find
for the force between these particles (to leading order in
k),

Fs = −24α⊥q2(cid:18) 1

4πε0(cid:19)2

R−7.

(34)

This result can be related to Eq. (31). Substituting q =
P E, the value at saturation, and α⊥ = 5/(βEP )α0 =
P/E (using the leading term for large field from Eq. (25)),
we find

Fs = −24

P 3

E (cid:18) 1

4πε0(cid:19)2

R−7.

(35)

This is identical to Eq. (31), except for a factor of two.
This is expected, as this factor of two takes into account
the force from the first fixed dipole interacting with the
second fluctuating one and vice versa. We have thus
demonstrated that Eq. (34) may be used to describe the
behavior of the force for large values of E. The impor-
tance of this observation lies in the statement, that such
reasoning might be applicable more generally: in case of
more complex behavior of p(E), i.e., more complex (or

uration and the polarizability α⊥ near saturation can be
used to accurately predict the force in the limit of large
external fields via Eq. (34).

IV. SUMMARY

We have demonstrated how the classical Casimir-
Polder force between two saturating dipoles can be sup-
pressed by applying an external static electric field. Of

special interest is the angle ϕ = arccos(cid:16) 1√3(cid:17) between

the external field and the vector connecting the dipoles,
for which the deterministic dipole-dipole interaction van-
ishes. The remaining "Casimir-Polder" part can then be
tuned and is arbitrarily suppressed at large values of ex-
ternal fields due to the vanishing polarizability. The force
in that case decays with E−1. This is in strong con-
trast to harmonic dipoles, which experience an increase
of the force in the presence of an external field, growing
with E2. We also provided a simple formula to estimate
the force between particles under strong fields. It would
be interesting to extend the results here to macroscopic
objects composed of such dipole carrying particles, here
multi-body effects will potentially change the physics for
dense systems. However for dilute systems, where the
pairwise approximation of van der Waals forces is accu-
rate, the results obtained here are directly applicable and
thus the modulation of Casimir or van der Waals forces,
predicted here will apply to a certain extent. Of course
an important main difference in more than two body sys-
tems is that the deterministic component of the interac-
tion cannot be obviously cancelled by a uniform electric
field, as there is more than one center to center vector,
denoted by R in this paper, separating the interacting
dipoles.
