Storing, transmitting, and manipulating information using the electron spin resides at the heart
of spintronics. Fundamental for future spintronics applications is the ability to control spin currents
in solid state systems. Among the different platforms proposed so far, semiconductors with strong
spin-orbit interaction are especially attractive as they promise fast and scalable spin control with
all-electrical protocols. Here we demonstrate both the generation and measurement of pure spin
currents in semiconductor nanostructures. Generation is purely electrical and mediated by the
spin dynamics in materials with a strong spin-orbit field. Measurement is accomplished using a
spin-to-charge conversion technique, based on the magnetic field symmetry of easily measurable
electrical quantities. Calibrating the spin-to-charge conversion via the conductance of a quantum
point contact, we quantitatively measure the mesoscopic spin Hall effect in a multiterminal GaAs
dot. We report spin currents of 174 pA, corresponding to a spin Hall angle of 34%.

The generation and detection of spin currents in nanos-
tructures is the central challenge of semiconductor spin-
tronics. On the one hand, spin injection cannot be easily
achieved by coupling semiconductors to ferromagnets [1]
because of the lack of control over material interfaces [2].
On the other hand, magnetoelectric alternatives exploit-
ing the celebrated spin Hall effect (SHE) [3, 4], have deliv-
ered only qualitative measurement protocols in transport
experiments [5]. Alternatively to all-electrical setups,
spin polarizing the current through a quantum point con-
tact (QPC) with a magnetic field allows a quantitative
control over spin current generation and detection at the
nanoscale [6 -- 8]. The latter approach typically requires
such high magnetic fields (6 − 8 Tesla) that, as a draw-
back, the desired magnetoelectric effects are either sup-
pressed or totally altered.

This Letter reports two major advances of nanoscale
semiconductor spintronics. Namely, we develop novel ex-
perimental methods to electrically generate and quanti-
tatively measure spin currents in a two-dimensional semi-
conductor nanostructure.

It is predicted that charge currents flowing through
spin-orbit interaction (SOI)-coupled nanostructures are
generically accompanied by spin currents, if the spin-
orbit time is shorter than the electron dwell time [9 -- 12].
This spin current generation mechanism is purely elec-
trical and based on the mesoscopic SHE (MSHE) [9, 10],
where the electronic orbital dynamics in chaotic nanos-
tructures cooperates with the SOI to make transport
spin dependent. We will consider an open three-terminal
quantum dot as represented in Fig. 1(a), where each lead
i is a QPC carrying Ni spin degenerate modes. Running
a charge current I between terminals 1 and 2, a spin cur-
rent in all terminals, including 3, is expected due to the

MSHE.

For a weak SOI, the spin currents' amplitude fluctu-
ates from sample to sample with zero average. For cav-
ities with a strong SOI, geometric correlations between
the spin and the orbital electronic dynamics lead to spin
currents with large, predictable nonzero average values
[13]. In the latter case, the spin currents' amplitude is
determined by the nanostructure geometry and the SOI
strength. This particular mechanism renders spin cur-
rents robust against decoherence and allows us to differ-
entiate them from mesoscopic fluctuations. This is es-
sential for spintronics applications, where spin currents
must be reproducible regardless of the microscopic details
of the sample.

To detect and measure the spin currents described
above, we employ the scheme of Ref.
[14], based on
the magnetic field parity of the voltage behind a QPC.
With reference to Fig. 1(a), we are interested in the spin
current I (S)
emitted from QPC3. The energy depen-
dent transmission probability of QPC3, T (s)
33 , is shown
in Fig. 1(b). At zero field, QPC3 is tuned to a con-
ductance of e2/h by a suitable gate voltage, correspond-
ing to a spin-independent transmission probability of one
half. A weak in-plane magnetic field B modifies the elec-
trons' kinetic energy via Zeeman coupling, selectively in-
creasing or decreasing the transmission probability ac-
cording to the spin eigenstate and magnetic field sign.
For simplicity, we assume I (S)
to be a pure spin cur-
rent at B = 0, arising as two counterpropagating and
inversely spin-polarized charge currents of equal magni-
tude, as schematically shown in Fig. 1(c), where arrows
indicate current amplitude and colors spin polarization.
A magnetic field affects the QPC spin dependent trans-
mission probability, enhancing one of the two charge cur-

is restricted to the linear response regime, and to termi-
nal 3 being a weak probe, i.e., N3 ≤ 1 (cid:28) N1, N2. The
measurement protocol described here is independent of
the spin current generation mechanism.
In particular,
the detection method can be used to measure spin cur-
rents of other origin.

Motivated by the theory above, we study a three-
terminal chaotic cavity embedded in a p-type GaAs two-
dimensional hole gas (2DHG) with a strong Rashba SOI.
Our sample, shown in Fig. 2(a), lacks any spatial sym-
metry and consists of three leads and five in-plane gates,
named QPCi and gj respectively. The gates g4 and g5,
colored in blue, tune the conductance of QPC3 with little
influence on the dot average conductance. The gates g1,
g2 and g3, depicted in red, tune the conductance of QPC1
and QPC2, and also affect the dot shape. The lateral ex-
tent of the cavity is about 2 µm, the hole mean free path
le = 4.8 µm and the spin-orbit length lSO = 36 nm [15].
Spin rotational symmetry is then completely broken and,

rents and suppressing the other. The result is the flow
of a net charge current I3 in the QPC. The sign of I3 re-
verses by reversing the magnetic field sign. Note that the
net spin current remains constant in the three situations
depicted in Fig. 1(c).

By operating QPC3 as a floating probe, the charge
current I3 is constantly fixed to zero. In this case, the
presence of a spin current I (S)
in the QPC reflects itself
in an antisymmetric component of the voltage behind
it: V3(B) (cid:54)= V3(−B). Remarkably, theory predicts that
the zero-field derivative of the measured voltage, ∂BV3,
is proportional to the spin current I (S)
polarized along
the applied magnetic field. The proportionality coeffi-
cient between the spin-to-charge signal ∂BV3 and I (S)
is
given by the QPC g factor and its energy sensitivity ¯hω
measured at N3 = 0.5 [14]:

More generally, for N3 ≤ 1 the presence of the spin
current still reflects itself in a finite spin-to-charge signal
whose amplitude is directly proportional to the detector
normalized transconductance: ∂BV3 ∝ ∂V G3/G3. For
N3 = 0.5 it results in ∂V G3/G3 = −π/¯hω. Details about
the derivation of this proportionality and Eq. (1) are re-
ported in the Supplemental Material [15]. Equation (1)
not only allows us to detect the presence of a spin cur-
rent flowing in QPC3, but also to quantitatively measure
and express it in units of ampere, giving the difference in
currents carried by electrons with opposite polarization.
Given the large SOI of our system, the measurement pro-
cess requires only weak magnetic fields that do not affect

field reversal both in the slowly varying background and
in the CFs, as expected from a two-terminal measure-
ment in the linear regime [17]. V3 is, on the contrary,
strongly asymmetric. We first address the slowly varying
background of V3(B). We will discuss the nature of the
CFs below.

Large CFs do not allow us to measure meaningful volt-
age asymmetries at small magnetic fields. We therefore
average them out by a linear regression of V3(B) in a
magnetic field range between −1 T and 1 T. The chosen
range is an optimal compromise between not sufficient
CFs averaging at small fields and unwanted changes of
the spin current at large fields. This interval includes at
least six CFs, and we carefully checked that the averaged
voltage asymmetry only weakly depends on the precise
magnetic field range used for the analysis.

The detector voltage asymmetry extracted in this way
is plotted in Fig. 3 (markers) together with the detec-
tor transconductance. We normalize the detector voltage
by the constant cavity current I and show the detector
transconductance in arbitrary units. Panels (a)-(d) rep-
resent different cavity configurations, with different N1
and N2 as indicated in every subfigure. Despite the large
error bars introduced by the CFs, in Figs. 3(a), 3(b) and
3(c) we observe what theory anticipates: a correlation of
the two quantities below the last detector conductance
step (right-hand side of each subfigure) and disappear-
ance of this correlation beyond the first plateau (left-
hand side of each subfigure). This is the key observation
from which we conclude that we measure a spin current.
Where the detector is most energy sensitive, we observe
useful signals with ∂BV3/I ≈ 70 ΩT−1, with a typical
background of 20 ΩT−1. The latter value was also typ-
ically observed for N1, N2 > 6, as shown in Fig. 3(d),
where the voltage asymmetry is uncorrelated with the
transconductance. This is expected due to suppression
of spin currents by energy averaging when many modes
contribute to transport.
In the following we give fur-
ther evidence supporting the spin current origin of the
observed voltage asymmetry.

To confirm the spin related nature of our signal, we
exploit a key ingredient for the spin-to-charge conver-
sion: the magnetic field sensitivity of the detector QPC.
A detector with zero g factor should result in a vanish-
ing voltage asymmetry, regardless of the spin current in-
tensity. We confirmed this prediction in the two ways
shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4(a) we modified the measure-
ment scheme such that the current flows from terminal
1 to 3, while terminal 2 is used as the detector. The lat-
ter is characterized in Ref. [18], and the first mode shows
g = 0. As expected, we observe a vanishing voltage asym-
metry for N2 → 0 for two different cavity shapes (dots
and squares respectively). As yet an additional test, we
kept the measurement scheme as in Fig. 2(a), but ro-
tated the sample by 90◦ in the 2DHG plane, to have the
magnetic field perpendicular to QPC3. Along this direc-

∂V G3/G3 (solid line) as a function of side gate voltage for
different number of modes in QPC1 and QPC2, as indicated in
each subfigure. Dots and squares in (a) represent two identical
measurements performed in different cooldowns [16].

with such a strong SOI, our cavity is in the so-called spin
chaos regime [13]. Unless differently stated, a charge cur-
rent I flows from terminal 1 to terminal 2, while terminal
3 is connected to a high impedance voltage amplifier and
is used to measure spin currents.

To measure the spin current in terminal 3, we first
extract the detector electric and magnetic sensitivity via
a standard QPC characterization. Figure 2(b) shows the
detector conductance G3 as a function of side gate voltage
for different values of a magnetic field aligned with the
QPC3 axis. The three well-developed plateaus visible at
zero field split at finite field. The zero field slope and
the finite field splitting give, respectively, ∂V G3 and the
g factor [15].

After the detector calibration, QPC3 is operated as
a voltage probe. The spin current measurement is per-
formed running an AC current (I = 4 nA unless stated
otherwise) between terminals 1 and 2, and measuring the
magnetic dependence of the voltages VC and V3 as defined
in Fig. 2(a). The magnetic field is applied in-plane, to
minimize its orbital effects, and aligned with the detec-
tor axis (unless stated otherwise). The finite zero field
derivative ∂BV3, and its correlation with ∂V G3/G3, indi-
cates the presence of the spin current I (S)

.

and V3/I as a function of B and the voltage applied to

ent temperatures. These line cuts are taken for N3 = 0.5.

ductance fluctuations (CFs) appear at low temperatures.

the disappearance of coherent effects in quantum dots
with few open channels [22]. The average signal is, on
the other hand, more resistant to temperature increases
because of its diffusionlike origin [13]. We performed
additional analysis of the temperature and charge cur-
rent amplitude dependence of the spin-to-charge signal.
These measurements, reported in the Supplemental Ma-
terial [15], confirm the distinct nature of CFs and the
spin-to-charge signal, as well as the fact that the spin-to-
charge signal is a linear effect.

So far, we discussed the presence of a robust spin
current in QPC3 visible from the slowing varying back-
ground of ∂BV3/I. As discussed in the context of the
MSHE, CFs might also reflect the presence of mesoscopic
spin CFs [9 -- 12]. Although the CFs occasionally show a
finite zero field slope [see Fig. 2(f)], it was not possible to
univocally assign them to spin related or orbital effects,
not considered in Ref. [14]. In particular, we could not
test the QPC3 transmission dependence of ∂BV3/I for
single CFs due to the influence of g4 and g5 on the cavity
shape.

We now evaluate the spin current amplitude for N3 =
0.5. With the measured detector sensitivity ¯hω =
0.46 meV, its g factor g = 0.27 and the typical volt-
age asymmetry of ∂BV3/I = 60ΩT−1, Eq. (1) gives
I (S)
3 = 174 pA. We compare this value with theoreti-
cal predictions on geometrical correlation induced spin
currents. The spin transmission of QPC3, calculated for
a three-terminal cavity in the spin chaos regime, is [13]:

To evaluate this expression we used ξ = 1, appropriate
for a ballistic dot, N1 = N2 = 4, N3 = 0.5. C is a system
specific prefactor, of order unity. Neglecting spin flips
caused by QPC3 itself, the expected spin current is

for a charge current of 4 nA. The very good agreement
with our measurement further supports the interpreta-
tion that our signal goes beyond a mere spin current de-
tection, but provides a quantitatively reliable magnitude.
As shown by Eq. 2, the spin conductance depends on N3,
allowing larger spin currents to be generated by opening
QPC3 further. However, since the detection scheme re-
quires N3 = 0.5, we could not probe this scenario.

Similarly to bulk materials, the spin-to-charge con-
version efficiency of the cavity can be expressed via
the spin Hall angle Θ, defined as the ratio between
spin and charge current densities.
In our case we get
3 /N3)/(I/N2) ≈ 34%, independent on N3 for
Θ = (I (S)
N3 (cid:28) N1, N2. This efficiency is substantially higher than
any reported for semiconductors [4], making this system
interesting for future semiconductor spintronics applica-
tions.

FIG. 4. (a) Comparison between ∂BV2/I acquired with two
different cavity shapes (dots and squares) both having N1 =
N3 = 4 and ∂V G2/G2 (solid line) as a function of the voltage

as detector. (b), (c) and (d) as in Fig. 3 but with the magnetic
field aligned perpendicularly to QPC3.

tion, the g factor vanishes for all modes [15], which is
a well-known anisotropy of p-type QPCs [18, 19]. The
latter is a particularly powerful approach as it leaves the
spin current unaltered and only suppresses the spin-to-
charge conversion efficiency. In Figs. 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d)
we show three of such measurements for the same mode
configurations as in Figs. 3(a), . 3(b) and . 3(c). In all
the three cases, the voltage asymmetry is comparable to
the background level of Fig. 3 and uncorrelated to the
detector transconductance, proving the importance of a
magnetic field sensitive measurement lead for observing
an asymmetric voltage signal.

The spin-to-charge signal shown in Fig. 3 reflects a ro-
bust property of the system and is not linked to CFs. The
CFs are phase coherent effects originating from electro-
static cavity shape distortion and magnetic flux penetra-
tion [20], or from a purely in-plane field as a consequence
of the asymmetric and finite-width confinement poten-
tial [21]. We carefully checked that our results do not
depend on the CFs' pattern first by changing g1, g2 and
g3 while keeping N1 and N2 constant, second by apply-
ing a strong voltage asymmetry on g4 and g5. In both
cases, the CFs are completely changed without a signifi-
cant modification of the voltage asymmetry extracted by
averaging. Additionally, Fig. 3(a) includes a measure-
ment performed during a different cooldown (squares)
[16]. Despite the completely different CFs' fingerprint,
an identical voltage asymmetry is obtained, proving the
robustness of the measured effect. As visible in Fig. 2(f),
coherent contributions are almost entirely suppressed at
T = 530 mK, which is a standard temperature scale for

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

In this Supplemental Material section we provide ad-
ditional information on the wafer structure used for the
experiment and on the techniques adopted to measure
the sample and characterize the detector QPC. We fur-
thermore show the current and temperature dependence
of the spin-to-charge signal discussed in the main text.
We provide an analytical treatment of the spin-to-charge
conversion effect directly applicable to our experiment
and we discuss its dependence on the detector QPC con-
ductance.

Materials and Methods

FIG. S.1. False color atomic force micrograph of the sample
under study, together with a schematic of the electrical setup
used to characterize QPC3.

The two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) in use consists
of a 15 nm GaAs quantum well placed 45 nm below the
surface. The sample is grown along the [001] direction
and remotely doped with carbon. The wafer has been
extensively characterized by magnetotransport measure-
ments in Ref. [23]. The total hole density is n = 3.0 ×
1015 m−2 and the strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction
(SOI) results in a splitting of the dispersion relation in
the two subbands with different total angular momentum
projection along the growth direction. The densities of
the two spin-orbit split subbands have been derived from
the periodicity of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations as
n1 = 1.05 × 1015 m−2 and n2 = 1.95 × 1015 m−2 result-
ing in a cubic Rashba parameter β = 1.4 × 10−28eVm3
[24]. The spin-orbit length, defined as the length scale
over which the electron spin rotates by 2π is calculated,
as in Ref. [13], as lSO = vF τSO = (¯hkF /m∗)(2¯h/∆SO).
F is the spin-orbit energy splitting, m∗ the
∆SO = 2βRk3
hole effective mass and kF the Fermi wavevector. Be-
cause of the large difference in m∗ and kF between the
two spin-orbit split subbands [23], we use their density-
averaged values m∗ = 0.71me and kF = 1.43 × 108 m−1.
Two nominally identical cavities were defined by elec-
tron beam lithography and wet etching (see Fig. 1(a)
of the main text). The samples were measured in a di-
lution refrigerator with a base temperature of 110 mK
using standard low-frequency lock-in techniques. The
tilt angle between 2DHG and magnetic field could be
tuned in-situ with an accuracy of less than 0.05◦. The
asymmetry in V3(B) and the conductance fluctuations
(CFs) visible in Fig. 2(f) of the main text are genuine ef-
fects due to the in-plane magnetic field only. Tilting the
2DHG angle with respect to the external magnetic field
between −0.25◦ and 0.25◦ leaves V3(B) unaffected, prov-
ing that an eventual residual out-of-plane component of
the magnetic field is negligible for the effects under dis-
cussion. The voltage measurements are performed in a
longitudinal configuration, so that an out-of-plane mag-
netic field would not result in the appearance of a Hall
slope. Changing the orientation of the device with re-

spect to the in-plane component of the magnetic field
required warming up the sample and manually changing
its bonding configuration. The electronic properties of
the sample and the characteristics of the QPC remained
largely unchanged by this carefully done procedure. The
two devices showed quantitatively comparable behavior,
reproducible over multiple cool-downs. In the main text
we show data from a single sample, characterized by a
larger tunability of the three QPCs used as leads.

Characterization of the detector QPC

In the following we describe in more detail the char-
acterization measurements performed on QPC3. The
data presented allows the extraction of the QPC g-factor
and energy sensitivity, used to quantify the spin current
intensity from the spin-to-charge signal. Furthermore,
we show the existence of a pronounced Zeeman splitting
anisotropy that allowed us to obtain the data presented in
Fig. 4 (b), (c) and (d) of the main text. A similar proce-
dure has been discussed in greater detail in Ref. [18, 19].
Fig. S.1 shows the electrical setup used for the char-
acterization of QPC3. A low-frequency AC bias Vin =
15µV was symmetrically applied to the cavity leads 2
and 3 and the current flowing in the structure was mea-
sured as a function of the voltage applied to g4 and g5.
At the same time, the voltage drop between terminal 1
and 3 was recorded, allowing to extract a four terminal
QPC conductance that does not depend on QPC1 and
QPC2. During the characterization of QPC3, QPC1 and
QPC2 were set to a very high conductance by negatively
biasing g1, g2 and g3. We carefully checked that the pre-
cise voltages applied to g1, g2 and g3 have no effects on
the presented results.

Via finite bias measurements, we extracted the voltage
dependent lever arm of g4 and g5. The lever arm al-
lows one to convert the gate voltage axis into energy and

extract quantities such as the g-factor and the energy
sensitivity ¯hω from a conductance measurement. For the
experiment under consideration, the determination of the
lever arm is irrelevant if both ¯hω and the g-factor are ex-
tracted from the same conductance plot and in a narrow
gate voltage range, as we do here. In fact, as shown by
Eq. (1) of the main text, the spin-to-charge conversion
amplitude is only given by the ratio ¯hω/g that does not
depend on the gate lever arm.

Close to a conductance G3 = e2/h, the relevant regime
for the effects presented in the main text, the lever arm
was measured to be 4 meVV−1. We determined ¯hω, i.e.
the curvature of the harmonic potential, by fitting a sad-
dle point model [25] to the QPC conductance [26]. Since
we do know the lever arm in this case, we can convert
the curvature into energy units by fitting the equation:

E0 and the potential curvature ¯hω. N is the mode
number of the plateau under consideration, in this case
N = 1.

The QPC is characterized by a strong g-factor
anisotropy, typical for QPCs embedded in 2DHGs grown
along the [001] crystallographic direction [18, 19]. The
QPC transconductance (numerical derivative with re-
spect to gate voltage) is shown in Fig. S.2 for three dif-
ferent magnetic field orientations. A finite spin splitting
is present when the magnetic field is oriented perpen-
dicularly to the plane of the 2DHG (Fig. S.2(a)) or in
the plane of the 2DHG and aligned along the QPC axis
(Fig. S.2(c)). No spin splitting up to 12 T is visible when
the magnetic field is aligned in the plane of the 2DHG
and perpendicular to the QPC axis (Fig. S.2(b)). In order
to use the QPC to detect a spin current via the spin-to-
charge conversion scheme, it is necessary to have a finite
g-factor (see Eq. (1) of the main text).
In the present
case, this is possible by performing the experiment with

the magnetic field oriented as in Fig. S.2(b). The g-factor
is obtained from Fig. S.2(b) by tracking the separation in
gate voltage between spin split plateaus as a function of
an in-plane magnetic field. The gate voltage separation
is then converted into Zeeman energy using the gate de-
pendent lever arm. For the first mode we find g = 0.27.
In order to suppress the spin-to-charge conversion effi-
ciency, the magnetic field must be turned by 90◦ in the
plane of the 2DHG, obtained in the situation shown in
Fig. S.2(c). In this case all the modes are characterized
by g = 0.

As visible in Fig. S.2(b), the levels splitting as a func-
tion of an in-plane magnetic field is not symmetric in
gate voltage. For each pair of spin-split levels, the left
branch rises in energy (more negative values of gate
voltage) faster then the right branch. The anomalous
magnetic field dependence of the QPC levels in an in-
plane magnetic field was recently studied in Ref. [18] and
found to be caused by a quadratic SOI peculiar for hole
gases. This anomalous spin-splitting makes the points of
strongest magnetic field dependence of G3 not to corre-
spond to the points of strongest gate-voltage dependence,
as assumed in Ref. [14], but to be slightly shifted to more
negative gate voltage. This effect might explain the small
horizontal offset between ∂BV3/I and ∂V G3/G3 seen in
Fig. 3(a), (b) and (c) of the main text.

Current and temperature dependence of the

spin-to-charge signal

The spin current detection method we employ is lim-
ited to the linear transport regime [27], estimated to
break-down in our samples for currents of a few nA. In the
linear regime, ∂BV3/I should be independent of I. We
plot this current dependence in Fig. S.3(a) for the same
configuration as Fig. 2(a) of the main text and N3 = 0.5.
Remarkably, the value of ∂BV3/I is independent of I for
I < 5 nA, confirming the hypothesis that the slope in

where ¯hω is the magnetic field energy sensitivity, µ =
gµB/2 is the electron magnetic moment and (2 − T (0)
33 )
is the charge transmission coefficient of contact 3. These
QPC parameters are easily measured experimentally.

In the following theoretical treatment we do not in-
clude the presence of any orbital effect. The latter as-
sumption is well justified if no out-of-plane magnetic field
is applied. An in-plane field can give rise to other or-
bital effects [21] which will not be accounted for in this
section, assuming that these are small enough. We will
always consider that the voltages applied to the system
are within the linear response regime (i.e.
small com-
pared to other energy scales). The generic current I (α)
at a contact i can be calculated using Landauer-Buttiker
formalism, resulting in:

hence they can be separated into a spin dependent part

ond term only via the Zeeman energy.

Fig. 3(a) of the main text for different temperatures.

V3(B) is a linear effect. For currents higher than 5 nA,
in addition to sample heating, we enter the non-linear
transport regime where the detector voltage asymmetry
and transconductance are not necessarily linked.

Fig S.3(b) shows the temperature dependence of the
extracted ∂BV3/I as in Fig. 3(a) of the main text, for
three different temperatures. At T = 530 mK we still
recover the same gate dependence of ∂BV3 as shown in
Fig. 3(a)of the main text, but with a reduction in peak-
to-peak height by a factor of 15. The signal eventually
disappears entirely at higher temperature because of the
ensuing energy-averaging, affecting also the geometric
correlation corrections. Furthermore, for T > 600 mK,
G3 loses the step-like behavior (hence its energy sensitiv-
ity), becoming a smooth function of the gate voltage.

Spin-to-charge conversion

We review here the theoretical basis for the spin-to-
charge conversion effect in a three-terminal mesoscopic
cavity as the one depicted in Fig. 1(a) of the main text.
We extend the theory presented in Ref. [14] to prove the
proportionality between ∂BV3/I and ∂V G3/G3.

The cavity under consideration has three contacts (la-
beled 1,2 and 3), and each of them is at a voltage Vi
and carries Ni spin degenerate modes. We consider the
situation where N3 ≤ 1 and N1, N2 (cid:29) 1. By applying
a voltage bias V2 − V1 between leads 1 and 2, a charge
current I will flow in the cavity. If contact 3 is grounded,
a charge current I (0)
3 will flow in it. In the following we
are interested in the situation in which no charge current
flows in contact 3 at zero magnetic field. This situation
can be achieved either by applying a voltage V3 that sets
I (0)
to zero at zero magnetic field, or by leaving it floating
3
and connected to a volt meter that measures V3. In the
first case, the application of a magnetic field will make
the current vary from zero, in the second case the cur-
rent will always remain zero and the measured V3 will
vary. As we will show in the following, the zero field
spin current I (S)
in contact 3 is directly proportional to
the zero-field derivative of I3, or V3, with respect to the

ity, hence Γ (EF − σµB) varies faster than τ σσ(cid:48)
3i (B) with
B. τ σσ(cid:48)
3i (B) are phenomenological parameters, describing
the spin transmission of the QPC when it is fully open.
Eq. (S.8) is valid only in the limit when an electron re-
flected back in the cavity from contact 3 has a negligible
probability to come back to contact 3 again. This limit
is achieved when N1, N2 (cid:29) N3.

Using Landauer-Buttiker expressions for charge and

spin current through contact 3 one has:

Equations (S.2) and (S.3) are obtained by evaluating
∂BI3(0)B=0 with constant V3 and ∂BV3B=0 for I (0)
3 = 0,
respectively. For obtaining a simpler analytical form of
these expressions, we will make an assumption of the spe-
cific form of the QPC transmission Γ, though the results
of this section do not qualitatively depend on this choice.
We choose the saddle point potential model, which gives
the QPC energy dependent transmission probability as
[25]:

Γ(EF , Vg, B) =

1 + exp (−2π (EF − αVg − σµB) /¯hω)

The partial derivative of the QPC transmission with re-
spect to magnetic field is:

expression for the charge current transmission coefficient
of contact 3. It can be approximated as (see Eq. (S.8)):

Combining the last three equations we get the expression:

∂BV3B=0 = µC

Γ(EF , Vg, 0)

,

(S.29)

where C is a prefactor containing the voltages Vi and
the coefficients τ σσ(cid:48)
. It is assumed to be constant with
respect to gate voltage. The results obtained here can be
summarized with the following proportionality relation:

3i

∂BV3B=0 ∝ ∂Vg Γ(EF , Vg, 0)B=0

Γ(EF , Vg, 0)

.

(S.30)

It is worth reminding that the last proportionality is valid
in the limit N1, N2 (cid:29) N3 and N3 ≤ 1 and the coefficients
τ σσ(cid:48)
are supposed to weakly depend on magnetic field.

3i

3i (B) = τ (0)

3i (−B) and τ (S)

In the absence of SOI, reversing the magnetic field di-
rection reverses the sign of the spin polarization S. In
3i (−B)
this case τ (0)
(see Eq. (S.6) and (S.7)). Since Γ(EF , Vg, B) is an even
3i (−B), and
function of B, it results that T σσ(cid:48)
I S
3 (0) = 0 (see Eq. (S.12)): in the absence of SOI, both

and ∂BV3 vanish.
