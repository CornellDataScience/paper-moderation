Abstract

Using density functional theory combined with quasi-harmonic approximation, we investigate

the thermal expansion behaviors of three different types (α, β, and γ) of graphyne which is a

two-dimensional carbon allotrope composed of sp and sp2 bonds. For each type of graphyne, we

obtain the temperature dependent area variation by minimizing its free energy as a function of

temperature, which is calculated by considering all the phonon modes in the whole Brillouin zone.
We find that all three types of graphyne exhibit negative in-plane thermal expansion up to T <∼
1000 K. The observed in-plane thermal contraction can be attributed partially to the ripple effect,

similarly in graphene. The ripple effect itself, however, is not sufficient to explain anomalously

larger thermal contraction found in graphyne than in graphene. Our deliberate analysis on the

phonon modes observed in graphyne enables us to discover another source causing such thermal

expansion anomaly. We find that there are particular phonon modes with frequencies around a
few hundreds of cm−1 existing exclusively in graphyne that may fill empty spaces resulting in area

reduction. These modes are identified as "rigid unit modes" corresponding to the libration of each

rigid unit composed of sp2 bonds.

INTRODUCTION

Various carbon allotropes based on sp2 hybridization, such as fullerenes, [1] nanotubes, [2]

and graphene, [3] have been intensively studied during last a few decades, since their first

discoveries. Their unique properties are basically related to the hexagonal geometry and the

Dirac cones in the electronic structure of graphene, [4 -- 6] which is a base material to form

other sp2-bonded carbon allotropes. To make use of graphene in future nanoelectronics,

however, it is indispensable to open an energy gap at the Fermi level EF . Although lots

of attempts have been made to open a band gap, [7 -- 12] nothing has yet come along for

practical applications. As a separate approach, sundry efforts have been made to search

for other 2D allotropes intrinsically possessing an energy gap at EF to be used as graphene

substitutes in electronic applications. [13]

A new 2D layered carbon allotrope called graphyne was proposed in 1987. [14] It can be

geometrically generated from graphene by inserting a single acetylenic linkage (AL) consist-

ing of two sp-hybridized carbon atoms into a bond in graphene composed of sp2-hybridized

carbon atoms only. Since there are a number of ways of inserting ALs, many different

types of graphyne can be formed. Among them were mainly considered three types with

a hexagonal symmetry, classified by the number of ALs attached to each sp2-hybridized or

triply-coordinated carbon atom: α-, β-, and γ-graphyne. Fig. 1(a -- c) shows their equilib-

rium structures. In α-graphyne shown in Fig. 1(a), there are three ALs connected to each

sp2-hybridized carbon atom, whereas in β-graphyne (γ-graphyne), every sp2-bonded atom

has only two ALs (one AL) as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively.

Theoretical studies reported that both α- and β-graphyne structures possess Dirac cones

near EF in its Brillouin zone (BZ) representing their semi-metallic characteristics like in

graphene. [15 -- 21] It was also reported that γ-graphyne, which is by far the most stable

graphyne, is interestingly an intrinsic semiconductor with a direct band gap of 0.46 eV at M

points. The existence of the band gap was ascribed by the Peierls instability resulting in the

wave function localization at the triple bonds. [18] It is, therefore, expected that γ-graphyne

could be made use of as a semiconducting component in future nanoelectronics.

Although various research groups have endeavored to synthesize them, graphyne has not

yet been realized in a crystalline form. Nevertheless, it was already reported that graphyne

sub units that resemble γ-graphyne were successfully synthesized. [22 -- 24] Moreover, one of

hexagonal unit cells are depicted by dashed parallelograms. Nonequivalent bonds in each type of

and one between two triply-coordinated atoms, respectively, whereas dt designates a triple bond

between two sp atoms in every acetylenic linkage. (d) Cohesive energy comparison of three types

called graphdiyne, was also reported to be discovered in the form of sheet, [25] as well as in a

tube form. [26] According to our calculation as well as other studies, [27 -- 29] β-graphyne and

γ-graphyne are even more stable than graphdiyne, as shown in Fig. 1(d), and thus expected

to be synthesized in near future.

Compared to the structural and electronic properties of α-, β-, and γ-graphyne that

have been intensively studied as discussed above, there have been not many studies on

their thermal and thermal expansion (TE) behaviors, [20, 21, 30] which are also necessary

properties to be disclosed in advance for them to be utilized as various devices in future

nanoelectronics.

It is well known that most materials expand thermally with a very different material-
dependent linear TE coefficient (TEC) of 10−7 ∼ 10−4 mainly due to the atomic vibration
under asymmetric potential. In almost all devices and equipment, such a TE usually be-

comes a critical problem deteriorating their performance and lifetime. There have been,

on the other hand, several reports revealing materials with a negative TEC (NTEC), such

as graphite, [31] carbon nanotubes, [32, 33] zirconium tungstate (ZrW2O8), [34] perovskite

oxides, [35 -- 37] and Invar alloys, [38, 39] originating due to a ripple effect, bending/twisting

modes, rigid unit modes (RUMs), [40, 41] atomic radius contraction, [42] or a magnetovolume

effects. [43] Researchers have made various attempts to make composites containing NTE

materials, such as ZrW2O8 [44 -- 46] and β-eucryptite [47], as a TE compensator, expecting

them to be high-performance composites with near zero TE. It was indeed shown that TE

can be suppressed in molten aluminum alloy with NTE manganese antiperovskites. [48]

In this letter, we report a first discovery of RUMs in two-dimensional graphitic carbon

systems, which are responsible for a TE anomaly of NTE in sp-sp2 hybridized carbon sys-

tems, similarly observed in 2D perovskites. [49] The thermal properties and TE behaviors

of α-, β-, and γ-graphyne were investigated by first-principles calculations of temperature-

and volume-dependent free energies from the phonon properties. Similar to graphene, all of
three configurations contract with temperature up to T≈1000 K, but the absolute values of
their TECs are much larger than that of graphene especially at low temperatures. Based on

our thorough investigation on their phonon modes, we attributed such thermal contraction

behaviors to not only the ripple effect as in graphene, but also RUMs corresponding to

libration motions of rigid units composed of sp2-bonds only.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

To investigate the TE behaviors of three types of graphyne, we first obtained their equi-

librium structures by carrying out first-principles calculations within the density functional

theory (DFT), [50] as implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), [51, 52]

while adjusting three different carbon-carbon bonds, and thus the lattice constant of each

graphyne as discussed in Sect. III. Projector augmented wave potentials [53, 54] was em-

ployed to describe the valence electrons, and the electronic wave functions were expanded by

a plane wave basis set with the cutoff energy of 450 eV. The exchange-correlation functional

was treated with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization [55] of the gener-

alized gradient approximation (GGA). To mimic single-layered graphyne, we introduced a
vacuum region with 15 A along the c-axis perpendicular to the sheet. The BZ was sampled
using a Γ-centered 10×10×1 k-grid for the primitive unit cell of each type of graphyne. Al-
though the primitive cell size of β-graphyne is larger than the other types, the same k-grid

was employed for precise calculation for β-graphyne because there were earlier studies on

β-graphyne showing inconsistent results on structural stability. [20, 21]

The phonon dispersion relations were computed by applying the finite displacement
method (FD) [56, 57] for 3×3×1 supercells. The corresponding reduced BZs were sampled
by 3×3×1 k-point meshes. In each supercell, we solved the secular equation of dynamical
matrix constructed at every wave vector q from the force constant matrices computed under

FD to obtain the phonon dispersion relation. To investigate thermal properties, we em-

ployed quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), [58, 59] in which the Helmholtz free energy

of a 2D graphyne sheet was calculated by

where ¯h, and kB are the reduced Planck constant, and the Boltzmann constant, respectively;

and ωq,n is the phonon frequency with the wave vectors q and the mode indices n. In Eq. (1),

the first term U (A) is the system internal energy with a constant area A at T = 0; the second

term represents the vibrational zero-point energy of the lattice; and the last term corresponds

to the phonon contribution to the free energy in QHA. [58, 59] U (A) and ωq,n were evaluated

at 12 different area points. F (T, A) was fitted to the integral form of the Vinet equation

of state [60] to obtain the minimum values of the thermodynamic functions with respect to

5

the area, and thus the equilibrium area, A(T ), as a function of temperature. TE behaviors

of three types of graphyne sheets were explored by calculating the area TEC αS(T ) as a

function of T ,

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We first searched for the equilibrium structures of three kinds of graphyne, which are

indispensable to their phonon dispersion relations and thermal properties. Graphyne can
be made by replacing all or some bonds in graphene by an AL (-C≡C-). Among numerous
different types of graphyne produced in this way, we only focused on three types of gra-

phyne, α, β, and γ, which are highly symmetric in a hexagonal lattice relative to the other

types. The α-graphyne can be made by a complete substitution for graphitic bonds, while

the β-graphyne and γ-graphyne can be formed by two-thirds and one-third substitutions, re-

spectively. In these types of graphyne, there are at most three nonequivalent carbon-carbon

bonds, d1, d2, and dt. Single-bond like d1 and d2 represent bonds from a sp2 atom to a
neighboring sp and sp2 atom, respectively, while a triple-bond dt describes a bond between

two neighboring sp atoms forming an AL together with two d1 bonds.

For each graphyne, we completely scanned the whole energy surface while adjusting the

bond length of three nonequivalent carbon-carbon bonds, d1, d2, and dt keeping its hexagonal

symmetry. Note that there are no d2 bonds in α-graphyne, and the lattice constant of

each unit cell is uniquely determined for each set of given d1, d2, and dt. The equilibrium

structures of three types of graphyne were determined at the minimum energy point in

each energy surface, and shown in Fig. 1(a -- c), where their hexagonal lattices were depicted

by dashed parallelograms representing their unit cells. Two nonequivalent bonds in the
α-graphyne were calculated to be d1 = 1.397 A and dt = 1.230 A with lattice constant of
aeq = 6.969 A. For the β-graphyne (γ-graphyne), on the other hand, its calculated lattice
constant and three nonequivalent bond lengths are aeq = 9.480 A (6.890 A), d1 = 1.389 A
(1.408 A), d2 = 1.458 A (1.426 A), and dt = 1.232 A (1.223 A). Our determined structural

parameters are in good agreement with other studies. [18, 21]

To compare the structural stability of three types of graphyne, we evaluated their cohesive

energies with respect to that of graphene as a function of Nsp/N , where Nsp and N are the

number of sp-bonded or doubly-coordinated atoms, and N and the total number of atoms

in the unit cell, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 1(d). these types of graphyne are only
0.6−0.8 eV/atom less stable than graphene. This tendency agrees well with quantum Monte
Carlo calculations [27 -- 29]. Especially, the γ-graphyne and β-graphyne are even more stable

than graphdiyne, which was already reported to be synthesized, [25, 26] expecting to be

synthesized as well.

Using 3×3×1-repeated supercells of the equilibrium structures, we calculated the phonon
dispersion relations of all three types of graphyne as shown in Fig. 2, and identified all the

phonon branches by analyzing their corresponding eigenvectors. We found in all cases that
there are three acoustic phonon branches below ν ≈ 400 cm−1, two in-plane modes with a
linear dispersion and one quadratic out-of-plane mode near Γ point. We did not find any

imaginary frequencies in all the types of graphyne indicating their structural stability. Note

that there were inconsistent results for β-graphyne in previous studies showing imaginary

phonon frequencies [21] or phonon mode anomalies, [20] which were not observed in our

calculation. We believe that such inconsistency was due to use of an incompletely relaxed

relations of α-graphyne and γ-graphyne are in good agreement with other studies. [20, 21]
Compared to graphene with its maximum frequency of <∼1600 cm−1, [61] graphyne ex-
hibits even higher phonon branches dispersed at ν >∼ 2000 cm−1. These high frequency
modes correspond mainly to the stretching vibration of the triple bonds dt with larger force

constants than single-bond-like d1 and d2, which generate graphene-like phonon modes at
ν <∼ 1500 cm−1 below a large frequency gap of ∆ν ≈ 500 cm−1, as displayed in Fig. 2.
The existence of such a large frequency gap implies that the vibration of dt bond stretching

modes is strongly protected from being scattered by the graphene-like modes by the energy
conservation law. [62] Another phonon gap of ∆ν ≈ 32, 78, or 67 cm−1, was also observed
near ν ≈ 500, 750, or 1000 cm−1 for α-, β-, or γ-graphyne, respectively. We found that the
d1 and d2 stretching modes are dispersed above the gap, while all the bending modes includ-

ing optical flexural modes are settled below. Note there is an exception in the α-graphyne

as displayed in Fig. 2(a) that there are two flat modes identified as optical flexural modes
located at ν ≈ 602 and 622 cm−1 above the gap. Therefore, in the α-graphyne, these optical
flexural phonons can be scattered by the stretching phonons, while in the other types of

graphyne, they are located at similar frequencies, but below their frequency gap, as shown

in Fig. 2(b) and (c), which protects them from being scattered by their corresponding d1

and d2 stretching modes.

To evaluate the Helmholtz free energy, we used Eq. (1) with the phonon dispersion rela-

tions ωq,n calculated at 12 different area points, based on QHA. For each type of graphyne,

the calculated Helmholtz free energy was plotted as a function of temperature and area

in a color-coded map as displayed in Fig. 3. Note that color-coded energy values clearly

represent that the γ-graphyne is more stable than the other two types. The temperature

dependence of the equilibrium area A(T ) was obtained by minimizing the thermodynamic

functions with respect to the area as denoted with the black solid line on each color-coded

map in Fig. 3.

We explored the TE behaviors of three types of graphyne as well as graphene for com-

parison by evaluating the temperature dependence of change in each system's area with
respect to the zero-temperature area, ∆A/A0 ≡ [A(T ) − A0]/A0, and its area TEC αs(T )
given by Eq. (2). It was found that similar to graphene, all three types of graphyne contract
as temperature increases up to T ≈ 1000 K, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Such an area shrink

observed in a 2D sheet was attributed to its flexural modes, which are mainly responsible

for the ripple effect, [63] as in graphene, [30, 61] and in graphyne. [21, 30] We confirmed the

contribution of flexural modes of graphyne to NTE by evaluating their corresponding mode

to be negative.

Using Eq. (2), we also calculated the TECs of three types of graphyne as well as graphene.

Compared to our calculated TEC values of graphene, which are in good agreement with

previous studies, [30, 61] it was observed that graphyne exhibits significantly lower TEC

values than graphene as shown in Fig. 4(b), which cannot be fully understood only by

the flexural modes responsible for the ripple effect. To scrutinize such large differences,

we thoroughly inspected the real-space vibrations of all the phonon modes by visualizing

their corresponding eigenvectors together with mode Gruneisen parameters at different wave

vectors q and mode indices n, and found intriguing unexpected vibrational modes, which

we classified as RUMs. [40] It has already been known that the RUMs and quasi RUMs

(qRUMs) involving a little distortion of rigid polyhedra are major causes of NTE occurred

in an oxide framework consisting of rigid polyhedra, such as MO4 and MO6, where M and

O are a metal cation and oxygen, [64, 65] although it was reported that there is no simple

correlation between NTE and RUMs. [66]

Fig. 5(a -- c) shows real-space visualization of typical RUMs (in the right) observed at
ν ≈ 382, 277, and 249 cm−1 in α-, β-, and γ-graphyne, respectively, in tandem with their
corresponding equilibrium configurations (in the left). The corresponding rigid units are

denoted respectively by gray polygons of a triangle, a rectangle, and a hexagon, each of

which encloses the sp2 carbon atoms connected with d1 and d2 bonds. During the libration

mode of the rigid unit in each graphyne, every AL becomes bended and thus the dt bonds

are lengthened as shown in Fig. 5(a -- c). We found that such lengthened bonds can be

compensated by filling an empty space or reducing the area size. To clarify the correlation

between these RUMs and NTE in the graphyne systems and to analyze the size reduction

quantitatively, we calculated the relative energy of each type of graphyne as a function of the

area change ∆A/A0 with respect to the zero-temperature area A0, and the rotation angle

ϕ of each rigid unit. Fig. 5(d -- f) displays the color-coded energy map, in which the area

reduction was estimated by searching for the minimum values of the relative energy ∆E

for a given ϕ, as depicted with cyan-colored line with dots. Since the maximum rotation

to the area reduction. The mode Gruneisen parameters corresponding the RUMs was also

calculated to be negative as similarly in the flexural modes contributing to the ripple effects.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We presented the phonon dispersion relations and the thermal expansion behaviors of α-,

β- and γ-graphyne using the density functional theory. Our calculated phonon dispersion

relations showed that there were no imaginary frequencies implying their structural stability.
Their high-frequency modes at ν ≈ 2000 cm−1 correspond to the stretching modes of the
triple bonds dt, which are protected by the large frequency gap from being scattered by

graphene-like modes of d1 and d2 bonds. Similarly, the stretching modes of d1 and d2 bonds

can also be protected from being scattered by their bending modes, since the latter modes are

separately located below another frequency gap, with an exception in α-graphyne. Our quasi

harmonic approximation calculations revealed that all types of graphyne exhibit negative

thermal expansion as in other 2D materials, but they have much larger values in negative

thermal expansion coefficients than graphene. This significant discrepancy was resolved

by identifying the rigid unit modes, which were firstly observed in 2D carbon graphitic

structures. We found that not only the ripple effect originating from the flexural modes,

but also the rigid unit modes are strongly responsible for the negative thermal expansion in

graphyne.
