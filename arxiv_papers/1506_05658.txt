The tribology of a bubble rubbing on a solid surface is studied via interfer-
ometry. A unique experimental setup is designed for monitoring the thickness pro-
files of a wetting film, intercalated between the bubble and hydrophilic glass mov-
ing with speed up to 412 m/s. The determination of the 3D film thickness profiles 
allows us to calculate 3D maps over the wetted surface of the local capillary, dis-
joining and lift pressures, viscous stress and friction force. In this way the average 
friction force and the corresponding friction coefficient are obtained. A theoretical 
model for the dependence of the friction coefficient on the film thickness is devel-
oped. The relevant slip coefficient, being a measure for the slip between liquid 
and solid, is determined as a function of the speed of the solid surface. It is found 
out that  below  170  m/s  a  friction  regime  exists  which  formally  resembles  dry 
friction,  while  at  larger  speed  the  friction  force  between  the  bubble  and  solid 
passes through a maximum. Furthermore, the friction coefficient has a large value 
at low speed of the solid and reduces substantially with the speed increase. 

 

The science of friction traces its roots five centuries back to the pioneering works of da 
Vinci1. Amontons2, Euler3 and Coulomb4 had later established the fundamental laws of dry fric-
tion between sliding solid bodies. Further on the dry contact between elastic bodies has been 
investigated by Hertz5, who laid out the foundations of contact mechanics. Reynolds6 found out 
that a liquid layer, intercalated between two solid surfaces in relative motion towards each other, 
becomes a lubricant. Thus, he has developed the hydrodynamic lubrication theory, which found 
many useful applications.7-11 With the advancement of technology, the friction is studied nowa-
days on micro- and nano-levels12,13 indicating elastic and plastic deformations of the surface as-
perities during the sliding process. The seminal work of Hertz5 on the friction between sliding 
elastic surfaces has been further developed in the middle of the previous century,14,15 while the 
contribution of adhesion between the elastic bodies in contact  has been accounted for in the 
Johnson-Kendall-Roberts16 (JKR) and the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov17 (DMP) theories. The term 
tribology is suggested by Jost18 as “the science and technology of interacting surfaces in relative 
motion and practices related to”. The term nano-tribology appeared upon bringing the scale of 
the investigations of sliding surfaces to nano and atomic dimensions.8,19,20 At present knowledge 
about  nano-tribology  is  exploited  for  designing  micro-  and  nano-electromechanical  systems 
(MEMS/NEMS), self-lubricating and biologically inspired surfaces.21 

The tribological  studies  mentioned  above  are  focused  on  sliding  solid phases  in  dry  or 
lubricated contact. Thin wetting film is a nano-layer lubricating the friction between a bubble and 
a solid surface when they are in relative motion towards each other. In addition, the thin layer is 
squeezed, due to the load force pressing the bubble toward the solid surface. The resulting liquid 
outflow is laminar and its hydrodynamics obeys the lubrication approximation.6,22-26 The theoret-
ical problem is even more complicated as far as the bubble surface is deformable and an addi-
tional slip on the solid surface could also appear. Thin films between rubber ball and moving solid 
have been already studied. It is reported27 that the load force squeezes out the liquid layer be-
tween  the  two  surfaces  until  the  point  of  touch.  Upon  moving  the  solid  surface  a  lift  force 
emerges tending to separate the two surfaces. The lift force increases with enhancing the speed 
of the solid until the point, where the load and lift forces become equal to each other and the 
rubber ball starts hydroplaning. The detaching of the two surfaces of the film occurs at a certain 
speed of motion of the solid. This valuable paper is a part of series of works27-30 devoted to the 
mechanism of rupturing of the film intercalated between elastomeric ball and moving solid. Ex-
cept the mechanism of rupturing and the critical velocity of hydroplaning, which are essential for 
such phenomena, the dependence of the friction and lift forces on the speed of motion of solid 
is important for the proper understanding of the hydroplaning of elastic surfaces. Being inspired 
by these works, we build up a unique experimental setup for investigating the tribology of bubble 
rubbing on solid surface. We replaced the elastomeric ball with a bubble in our studies. The uti-
lization of such kind of experimental setup is valuable from fundamental viewpoint because the 
bubble is substantially more deformable than the elastomeric ball, which makes us able to de-
termine the 3D film thickness profile and subsequently 3D maps of the lift and friction forces over 
the surface of the bubble. Moreover, thin wetting films on moving solid surface have been never 
investigated despite the intensive research on them since their very early studies in 1939.31,32 In 
addition to the fundamental viewpoint such study will be of interest for specialists in flotation of 
mineral particles, whose object of research is the interaction between particle and bubble under 
dynamic conditions. 

The experimental setup specially designed for the experiments consist of the following 
elements (Fig. 1): i) table allowing automated motion in x and y directions with different speed; 
ii) experimental cell filled with aqueous medium; iii) capillary tube filled with air and connected 
hermetically with micro-syringe for increasing the tube pressure; iv) pressure transducer; v) ob-
jective of upright microscope working under regime of reflection. The capillary tube is immersed 
into the experimental cell. The pressure inside the cell is increased by means of the micro-syringe. 
This forms a bubble on the top of the capillary tube. The bubble gets in contact with the substrate, 
situated on the bottom of the experimental cell. Thus a thin wetting film is formed and the load 
pressure between the bubble and the substrate surface is measured by means of the pressure 
transducer. The two surfaces of the wetting film are illuminated normally with polychromatic and 
coherent  light  through  the  microscope  objective.  The  reflected  light  by  the  two  film  surfaces 

forms an interference pattern, which is stored to computer and processed offline. The lower sur-
face of the wetting film (the solid substrate) is moved tangentially by means of the automatic 
moving table. Thus the experimental cell with the solid substrate on its bottom is moved in x or 
y direction, while the capillary tube with the bubble on its top remains stationary. 

The offline processing of the interference pattern provides information about the varia-
tion of the film thickness profile in a given time interval. Thus the load pressure, the local thick-
ness in every point of the wetting film and the tangential speed of the lower surface are moni-
tored. The experiment are conducted with speed of the solid surface in wide range of 6 to 412 
m/s. At each speed of motion of the solid substrate, the wetting films have particular stationary 
shape corresponding to a certain 3D film thickness profile. A movie for each particular case  is 
made followed by off-line processing by means of Image J program. To achieve a 3D profile,  a 
stationary interferogram of a certain frame of the movie was chosen. 

 

Figure 1. Experimental setup for tribological experiments on wetting films. 

Each picture of the interferogram has been processed in the following way (see Fig. 2): Multiple 
horizontal and parallel to each other lines crossing the film have been drawn by means of the 
graphical tool of Image J software. Each of these lines, coinciding with the horizontal x axis, was 
coupled with particular spatial interferogram along the line crossing the film, obtained by “plot 
profile” option of Image J software. Thus, a series of spatial interferograms corresponding to each 
line along the axis x were obtained and converted to real film thickness profiles by means of the 
interferometry formula24.  The distances,  coinciding  with the  vertical  axis  y  between  the  lines, 
were known as well. Thus were obtained the exact coordinates x and y corresponding to each 
film thickness. The 3D profiles were obtained by 100 x 100 matrixes via Microcal Origin software 
version 5. We have exploited the 3 D film thickness profile to obtain 3D maps of the local capillary 

pressure, disjoining pressure, viscous dissipation, lift pressure, and the local friction force over 
the wetting film surface. Thus, we obtained the averaged values of these parameters as a func-
tion of the speed of motion of the solid substrate.

The physics behind the bubble rubbing on solid surface is simple. There is a constant capillary 
pressure pushing the bubble toward the solid surface and the latter is opposed by the disjoining 
pressure. When these two pressures are equal, the wetting film is planar at equilibrium. If the 
solid surface starts moving, a pressure gradient along the film emerges making the film inhomo-
geneous  and  thicker,  which  results  in  a  weaker  and  inhomogeneous  disjoining  pressure.  The 
bending of the film air/water interface generates local capillary pressure tending to recover the 
original planar shape. In addition, there is a viscous dissipation across the film. When all these 
effects are balanced the corresponding wetting film is stationary. Let us have a wetting film with 
thickness h and the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system is shown in Fig. 3. The lower solid 
surface of the film moves in the x direction with controlled speed U. In the frames of the Reynolds 
lubrication approximation the Navier-Stokes equations can be presented in the following form

The last equation corresponds to the stress-free air/water interface, while the first two Navier 
equations35 presume a possible slip on the glass/water surface with a slip friction coefficient

The usual nonslip boundary condition corresponds to

 is valid for stress-free 

surfaces as the air/water one. The ratio 
 is known as the slip length. From a previous inves-
tigation of an oscillating bubble against a quartz plate37 one can determine a value of the relevant 
slip coefficient of 
 kPa s/m, which corresponds to a slip length of 800 nm. It is important 

to stress that the slip length is not directly related to the slipping plane, which is attribute of an 
integral approximation of the overall hydrodynamics. In the case of presence of slip effect, the 
zeta potential will be probably affected by the value of the slip coefficient 
. Note that the latter 

is very sensitive to entrapped air on the glass/water surface (the Cassie effect) and for this reason 
the super-hydrophobic surfaces possesses huge slip lengths larger than 10 µm.38 Integrating Eq.

6 to 412 m/s and determined their 3D film thickness profiles (see Fig. 4). By means of these data 
we  have  determined  and  3D  maps  of  the  local  capillary  pressure,  disjoining  pressure,  viscous 
dissipation, hydrodynamic lift pressure and the local friction force over the wetting film surface. 
Figure 4 presents just an illustration of 3D film thickness profiles and their corresponding 3D maps 
of the lift pressure calculated by means of Eq. (11). 
 

 

Figure 5. The average film thickness versus speed of the solid. 

 
Figure 5 presents the average film thickness versus the speed of motion of the solid substrate. In 
the case of immovable solid substrate the wetting films are almost planar with equilibrium film 
thickness about 15.4 nm, which is due to the capillary pressure (
) pushing the bubble 

towards the solid and the total disjoining pressure acting in opposite direction. One can see very 
steep increase in the average film thickness upon enhancing the speed of the solid motion from 
zero to about 15 m/s, beyond which this dependence weakens about 19 times (see Fig. 5). The 
thickening of the wetting films is due to the additional lift pressure generated by the motion of 
the solid thus making the films hydroplaning. The dependence of the lift pressure on the speed 
of motion of the solid is presented in Fig. 6. Similarly to Fig. 5, the lift pressure increases steeply 
upon enhancing the speed of the motion from zero to about 15 nm, beyond which the depend-
ence weakens about 144 times (see Fig. 6). The dependence of the average friction force per unit 
area on the speed of motion of the solid is presented in Fig. 7. One can see that within the range 
of speeds (0 – 412m/s) this dependence passes through a maximum located at about 270 m/s. 
Moreover, the friction between the bubble and the solid surface in range of 6 to 110 m/s prac-
tically does not change (see Fig.7), which coincides with the third law of Amontons for the dry 
friction  stating  that  the  kinetic  friction  is  independent  of  the  sliding  velocity.  Yet,  this  friction 

240 Papy = 0.1942x + 38.945R² = 0.96190204060801001201400100200300400500h, nmU, m/sy = 3.72x + 15.43depends on the apparent contact area between the bubble and solid (the film radius), which is 
in violation of the second law of Amontons stating that the force of friction is independent of the 
apparent area of contact. This promotes the idea that in the range of 6 to 110  m/s a mixed 
regime between dry and lubricated friction.

The dependence of the friction coefficient per unit area 

 on the speed of solid motion 

is presented in Fig. 8. As seen in the figure, the values of the friction coefficient 

 substantially 

decreases upon increasing the speed of solid’s motion up to 110 m/s, beyond which does not 
change significantly with the further enhance of the speed of solid’s motion Meanwhile, Eq. (10) 
is one of the central equations of our  theoretical model because it describes how the friction 
 depends on the film thickness. An important parameter in Eq. (10) is the friction 
coefficient 

slip coefficient , which has been defined in boundary conditions Eq. (2). If we suppose  as a 
constant Eq. (10) predicts theoretical curve 
, which differs significantly from the ex-

 versus 

perimental data. For this reason we concluded that   is implicit function of the speed of solid 
motion U. Due to the fact that we do not have any theoretical description about  as a function 
of U, we suggest the following empirical relation between the these two parameters:

the two free parameters

The first tree points from the left hand side of Fig. 9 corresponds to speed of solid motion in the 
range of 6 – 67 m/s, at which the averaged film thickness changes weakly, but the friction coef-
ficient reduces significantly. The further increase of the speed of solid’s motion is related with 
stronger increase of the averaged film thickness and insignificant change of the friction coeffi-
cient. There is obviously inverse proportion between the averaged film thickness and friction co-
efficient dependencies on the speed of the solid’s motion.

solid’s motion. The friction slip coefficient  is inversely proportional to the slip between the solid 
and the liquid. One can see that the slip between the solid and the liquid is small at low speeds 
of motion. According to Fig. 10 the slip increases significantly with enhancement of the speed of 
the solid’s motion until reaching very high values, at which almost does not depend of the speed 
of the solid motion anymore. 

The present paper is a first step in our investigations on the tribology of viscoelastic bodies 
rubbing on solid surfaces. One can conclude the following: i) A regime of mixed friction between 
dry and lubricated frictions exists in the range of 6 – 170 m/s, beyond which the rubbing be-
tween the bubble and solid becomes completely lubricated and passes through maximum; ii) The 
friction coefficient has high values at very small speeds of solid’s motion and reduces and reduces 
substantially with the increase of the speed of the solid motion until reaching small values, which 
change insignificantly with the further increase of the speed of the solid; iii) It was derived em-
pirical dependence between the friction slip coefficient and speed of the solid indicating small 
slip at low speeds and high slip at large speeds at which the slip becomes practically constant. 
The present study appears to be first one in literature devoted to the rheology of the rubbing 
between bubble and solid surface. Our study can be continued with further experiments with 
larger speeds of motion of the solid. We have to point out that 3D film thickness profiles of the 
wetting film at high speeds are difficult to determine as far as couple of orders of interference 
are usually combined on one interference pattern. Yet, such a determination is possible although 
being quite difficult.
