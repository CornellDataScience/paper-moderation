We report on the transport properties of hybrid devices obtained by depositing graphene on
a LaAlO3/SrTiO3 oxide junction hosting a 4 nm-deep two-dimensional electron system. At low
graphene-oxide inter-layer bias the two electron systems are electrically isolated, despite their small
spatial separation, and very efficient reciprocal gating is shown. A pronounced rectifying behavior
is observed for larger bias values and ascribed to the interplay between electrostatic depletion and
tunneling across the LaAlO3 barrier. The relevance of these results in the context of strongly-coupled
bilayer systems is discussed.

Graphene is widely investigated in view of possible de-
vice applications owing to its excellent, electric-field tun-
able electronic properties1, its chemical and structural
robustness, its ease of production and integrability with a
plethora of other material systems2. In addition, because
of its single-atom thickness, its properties can be very
sensitive to the local environment. In particular, interac-
tion with the host substrate offers new ways to tune the
properties of graphene and the case of functional transi-
tion metal oxides is of significant interest. For instance,
graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) built on ferroelec-
tric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 substrates display pronounced memory
effects, ultra-low voltage operation3, and open the way
to novel nanoplasmonic devices4. Similarly, graphene
photo-sensitivity was shown to increase 25 times on TiO2
substrates5 and intriguing magnetic phenomena are ac-
tively pursued in devices combining graphene with EuO
substrates6 or magnetic LaxSr1−xMnO3 electrodes7.

In the family of transition metal oxides,

interfaces
between the bulk band insulators LaAlO3 (LAO) and
SrTiO3 (STO) occupy a special place due to their multi-
ple, electric-field tunable properties, such as conductiv-
ity8,9, superconductivity10,11, magnetism12,13 and spin-
orbit coupling14. These phenomena stem from the emer-
gence of an interfacial two-dimensional electron system
(2DES) when more than 3 unit cells (u.c.)
of LAO
are grown on a TiO2-terminated STO crystal. Such
2DES is located only a few nm below the surface and
its properties are therefore extremely sensitive to other
materials deposited on this surface, such as metals15
or other oxides16.
In this scenario, hybrid structures
combining graphene with LAO/STO junctions represent
an exciting platform in which novel phenomena may
emerge from the strong electronic coupling of the respec-
tive 2DESs. In particular, collective interlayer-correlated
phases driven by the strong Coulomb interactions are
expected at low temperatures, in analogy to what ob-

served in graphene/GaAs/AlGaAs systems17. Further-
more, magnetic or superconducting properties may be in-
duced in graphene due to the proximity interaction with
the ordered phases of the interfacial 2DES. In order to
enable the exploration of these possibilities, the necessary
starting point is a clear understanding of the transport
behavior of these hybrid systems. LAO/STO-graphene
systems, however, have been so far little studied. In a
recent paper 18, graphene was integrated with insulat-
ing LAO/STO substrates with subcritical LAO thickness,
where a scanning probe microscope was used to "write"
nanometer-wide conductive regions on the oxide system19
and graphene was used as a gate electrode controlling
the conduction of these nanowires at the LAO/STO in-
terface.
Here we report on extended (≈ 104 µm2) junctions be-
tween monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor de-
position (CVD) and a conductive, 4 nm-deep LAO/STO
interface hosting a 2DES. Our results demonstrate that
strong electrostatic coupling with virtually no leakage
can be obtained at room-temperature (RT) between a
two-dimensional hole gas in graphene and the LAO/STO
2DES, as long as the graphene-oxide bias VGO is suffi-
ciently small (VGO (cid:46) 1 V). At larger values of VGO,
we shall report strongly non-linear transport across the
vertical graphene-LAO/STO junction that will be linked
to tunneling currents between the two electron systems.
The device structure adopted in this work is illustrated
in Fig. 1. High-quality 2DESs were obtained by growing
10 u.c.-thick LAO films on TiO2-terminated STO chips
by pulsed laser deposition20. Cr/Au alignment markers
were fabricated by e-beam lithography and thermal evap-
oration and no additional processing was carried out in
order to minimize contamination and damage of the ox-
ide system. Single-crystalline graphene flakes typically
measuring 100 µm in diameter were grown by CVD on

flat, ex-situ passivated Cu foils21. Graphene crystals were
finally deposited on the clean surfaces of LAO/STO het-
erostructures using a polymer-based transfer process22
and localized thanks to the Cr/Au markers. The de-
vice architecture was designed taking particular care to
avoid spurious electrical losses across the ≈ 4 nm-thin
LAO barrier. An insulating layer of 200 nm of cross-
linked PMMA was inserted between the LAO/STO and
graphene electrodes (see the sketch of Fig. 1a and the op-
tical picture of Fig. 1b), so that the only electrical path
between the contact leads and the LAO/STO 2DES oc-
curred vertically through the graphene-LAO/STO junc-
tion. The correct alignment of the flakes and their quality
at the end of the process were assessed through Raman
spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 1c,d for one of the stud-
ied devices. Given the relatively strong background sig-
nal from the LAO/STO substrate, Raman spectra were
processed by subtracting the response of the bare oxide
heterostructure (see Fig. 1d). Once this background sig-
nal was removed, Raman emission clearly indicated that
the graphene flake was a high-quality monolayer, with

a single-Lorentzian 2D peak, the expected G/2D peak
ratio for monolayer graphene and no discernible D peak
throughout the crystal23. The correct alignment and uni-
formity of the flake is demonstrated in Fig. 1c, where we
report a Raman map integrated over the spectral region
2600 − 2800 cm−1 corresponding to the 2D peak.

Device parameters and structure were chosen to
achieve strong electrostatic coupling between the 2DESs
in graphene and in the LAO/STO heterojunction, with
negligible tunneling in the small interlayer bias (VGO)
limit. Based on electron affinity values24, we estimate a
large (∼ 2 eV) graphene - LAO barrier (see Fig. 2a) that
should electrically decouple the two electronic systems.
At present many of the band parameters of the junction,
in particular the exact band offsets and, consequently, the
built-in field in the LAO layer, are still debated [25,26,
and references therein]. In addition, the triangular quan-
tum well potential at the LAO/STO interface confines
the motion of oxide electrons to a non-trivial set of 2D
subbands characterized by different and anisotropic ef-
fective masses27,28. In the following, the interface 2DES

2DES respectively. The negative density indicates that
the as-deposited graphene is p-doped, as typically ob-
served. Based on this experimental input, the model
predicts that graphene can be tuned up to densities of
∼ 1013 cm−2 both on the electron and hole sides and
that LAO/STO can be fully depleted by biasing graphene
at a few Volts. Such a strong electrostatic coupling is
due to the small thickness of the LAO barrier: assum-
ing κLAO = 20 for the LAO relative permittivity, the
geometric capacitance per unit area is estimated to be
4.5 µF/cm2, corresponding to a gating efficiency ≈ 400
times higher than available in typical 300 nm thick oxi-
dized Si. As a consequence, the charge-neutrality point
(CNP) is expected to occur in graphene at very low (neg-
ative) bias values (VGO < 0.5 V).

The typical transport and gating properties of a rep-
resentative graphene-LAO/STO hybrid device are re-
ported in Fig. 3. The insulating properties of the PMMA
layer were preliminarily studied on ≈ 200 × 200 µm2 test
pads covered by unconnected metallic electrodes: negli-
gible ((cid:46) 0.1 nA) vertical currents were observed for ver-
tical biases in the studied VGO range. Graphene devices
were measured using a piezo-actuated microprobe sys-
tem from Imina Technologies in order to avoid inducing
electrical loss through the PMMA as a consequence of
wire-bonding. We studied the RT vertical transport be-
tween the oxide interfacial 2DES and graphene by ap-
plying a DC bias VGO to the graphene electrode while
holding the interfacial 2DES at ground. As shown in
Fig. 3a, a strongly non-linear transport characteristic was
observed, where different regimes can be distinguished.
Around zero bias, graphene and the 2DES are insulated
and no current could be detected above the noise: a cur-
rent below few pA is measured for VGO < 0.7 V, cor-
responding to a resistance in the range 100 GΩ − 1 TΩ.
Based on the measured carrier densities, graphene's CNP
is expected to lie in this voltage range (see Fig. 2b).
Outside this interval, vertical transport sets on, with
an approximately exponential current-voltage character-
istic. For VGO < −2.5 V, vertical current saturates to a
fraction of nA: as discussed in the following, this is due to
a field-effect depletion of the oxide interfacial 2DES. The
exponential growth is much more pronounced for positive
bias values: the current grows by 5 orders of magnitude
in less than 1V of bias change and it is ultimately limited
(for VGO > 2 V) by the resistive load of the 2DES paths
connecting the junction area to the electrodes.

Transport in the latter regime is governed only by the
vertical junction properties and was therefore amenable
to theoretical modeling29. The observed transport char-
acteristics at positive bias are compatible with direct
tunneling of electrons between graphene and the inter-
facial 2DES. In fact, the large graphene-LAO barrier
(∼ 2 eV) suggests that thermionic emission should be
suppressed even at RT, while tunneling remains possi-
ble because of the ultra-thin barrier. Zener tunneling
across the LAO should be negligibly small for 10 u.c.-

will be simply described by a single isotropic 2D subband
and charge transport between the two 2DESs will be as-
sumed to occur via direct tunneling across the ≈ 4 nm
LAO barrier. The electrostatic coupling between the two
2DES will be described in terms of a capacitor in which
the electrodes have a finite density of states (DOS)29.

Figure 2b reports the predicted evolution of the carrier
density in the two 2DESs, setting the values at zero bias
to the experimentally-measured ones29. For this mea-
surement, multi-terminal Hall-bar structures were real-
ized by a lift-off technique30 with a nominally identical
10 u.c. LAO/STO heterointerface. The electron den-
sities at 4.2 K were found to be 1.6 × 1013 cm−2 and
−6 × 1011 cm−2 for the LAO/STO and the graphene

thick LAO films31, particularly for positive values of VGO,
which tend to flatten the LAO potential. Therefore, only
direct graphene-2DES tunneling was considered and cal-
culated in the semiclassical (WKB) approximation, that
was already successfully adopted to describe transport
features in both metal/LAO/STO31 and van der Waals
heterostructures comprising graphene32. Input parame-
ters used to reproduce the experimental data are reported
in Fig. 2a and were set at the typically reported values

in the literature, apart from the barrier effective mass
that was obtained by fitting the data in the Simmon's
approximation (dotted blue curve in Fig. 3a)29. Fig. 3a
compares the resulting theoretical prediction (red dashed
line) with a typical experimental curve (solid black line):
the model captures the main transport features in the
whole bias range and it is quantitatively accurate in the
intrinsic regime, thus providing evidence that graphene -
interfacial 2DES transport is indeed dominated by direct
tunneling of electrons through the LAO barrier. The re-
maining discrepancies between the theoretical prediction
and experimental data in the intrinsic regime point to the
possible role played by the inner structure of the oxide
interfacial 2DES27,28 (the population of several subbands
changes the transport characteristics), or the possible
contribution of tunneling processes assisted by phonons
and/or in-gap defect states in the LAO barrier (e.g. O
vacancies). The deviations observed for VGO < 0.5 V
are due to electronic noise and interface depletion issues
and are not addressed by the present model. Finally, we
note that similar rectifying behavior was already reported
in metal(Pt,Au)/LAO/STO junctions11,31 and was also
attributed mainly to quantum tunneling31. The simi-
larities are due to the metallic behavior of graphene for
large positive values of VGO, as shown in Fig. 2b, and the
comparable electron affinities of graphene and Pt, Au.

In conclusion, we reported on the transport properties

In the low inter-layer bias limit, and for the full range
VGO < 1.0 V, graphene and the interfacial 2DES can be
considered electrically insulated, with vertical currents
lower than 0.5 nA. The existence of this quasi-insulating
regime makes it possible to explore Coulomb coupling
between the two electron systems. We monitored the 2-
point RT resistance of graphene as a function of VGO:
the result is shown in Fig. 3b for a representative de-
vice and demonstrates the significant modulation of the
graphene resistivity by the electric field of the 2DES elec-
trode. The resistance curve indicates that graphene can
be easily tuned between p-type and n-type conduction
at a VGO value as little as a fraction of a Volt, despite
the non-negligible intrinsic doping −6× 1011 cm−2. This
behavior confirms the extremely large gating efficiency of
the system.

The analogous field-effect of graphene on the interfa-
cial 2DES predicted from the capacitor model in Fig. 2b
can be inferred both from gating and vertical transport
features.
In fact, the graphene gating efficiency expe-
riences a sudden drop for VGO < −1V and is totally
suppressed for VGO < −2.5V, as signaled by the re-
sistivity saturation in Fig. 3b. This effect matches the
kink and the subsequent current saturation in the ver-
tical transport curve in Fig. 3a, which persists up to
VGO = −90 V (data not shown). These observations
provide experimental evidence of the predicted depletion
of the 2DES for large negative bias; the creation of an in-
sulating region below graphene interrupts the conducting
paths to the LAO/STO electrodes and therefore limits
vertical transport.

Supplemental Materials

Here we summarize details on the theoretical modeling of electrostatic effects and inter-layer tunneling in graphene-
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 hybrid systems.

I. ELECTROSTATIC CONSIDERATIONS

The vertical voltage bias VGO is defined as the
electro-chemical potential difference between the two-
dimensional electron system (2DES) in graphene and the
2DES at the oxide interface (the "interfacial 2DES"), i.e.

(0)

− φO − µO + E

VGO ≡ φG + µG + E
G−e

(SE1)
where −e is the electron charge, φG(O) is the electric po-
(0)
tential of the graphene sheet (interfacial 2DES), E
G(O) is
the energy of the Dirac point (bottom of the 2D subband,
represented by the red line inside the triangular well in
Fig. 2a) of graphene (the interfacial 2DES) measured
from the vacuum level, and µG(O) is the corresponding
chemical potential measured with respect to the Dirac
point (2D subband edge).

+ φ . (SE2)

+ φ ≡ e(nG − nO)

The two 2DESs can be modeled as a parallel plate
capacitor. The electric potential difference can therefore
be written as:
φG − φO = ed(nG − nO)
Here, nG(O)
free electrons in the
graphene sheet (interfacial 2DES), r is the relative di-
electric constant of the barrier material, φ is a contri-
bution arising from bound charges in the system (e.g.
charges bounded at the termination surface of LAO,
charged impurities adsorbed on the graphene flake, etc.),
and C = 0r/d is the geometrical capacitance of the
junction per unit area.
In the T → 0 limit the chemical potential coincides

(SE4)

In writing the previous equation we have dramatically
simplified the description of the interfacial 2DES: we as-
sume that it occupies a single 2D subband of the inter-
facial triangular quantum well, and assume the subband
dispersion to be parabolic and isotropic with an effec-
tive band mass mb. Following Ref. S1, we identify the

band mass with the mass of light quasiparticles and set
mb ∼ me, where me is the bare electron mass in vacuum.
In Eq. (SE3), vF ∼ 106 m/s is the graphene Fermi veloc-
ity. At finite temperature T, µO(nO, T) and µG(nG, T)
can be found numerically.
Increasing temperature, the
chemical potential moves towards (away from) the Dirac
point (subband edge) in graphene (the interfacial 2DES).

At zero bias, Eq. (SE1) reduces to

We now assume that,

increasing the bias voltage,
charge is transferred only between graphene and the in-
terfacial 2DES. We write the carrier densities as nG(O) =
G(O) ∓ δn, where the minus (plus) sign applies to
(0)

graphene (the interfacial 2DES). We can therefore write
an equation for the unknown δn, which can be easily
solved numerically. It reads as following

II. THEORY OF THE INTER-LAYER
TUNNELING CURRENT BETWEEN

GRAPHENE AND THE INTERFACIAL 2DES

The current density flowing from graphene to the in-

terfacial 2DES can be written as:

Wαβ(nα − nβ) ,

(SE7)

X

X

α∈O

β∈G

J = e
S

where α (β) labels the electronic states localized at the
oxide interface (in the graphene layer), nα(β) is the oc-

cupation probability of the state α (β), Wαβ is the tran-
sition probability per unit time from the state α to the
state β, and S is the surface of the device.

We assume that: i) the occupation probability of the
in each electron system, by a Fermi-
states is given,
Dirac distribution nα(β) = fFD(α(β) − µO(G)) where
fFD(E) = [exp (E/(kBT)) + 1]−1, and α(β)
is mea-
sured from the bottom of the conduction band (from
the Dirac point), T being temperature;
ii) the transi-
tion probability Wαβ depends only on the energy of the
initial and final states;
iii) only elastic processes con-
tribute to the tunneling current. Under these assump-

tions Wαβ = δ(α +E

an approximate analytical result for the tunneling cur-

known formulas for 3D-to-3D tunnelingS2 -- S5 and use it
to fit the experimental data.

For low bias (i.e. VGO (cid:28) ∆O, ∆G), in the spirit of

barrier with a rectangular barrier with average height

For large negative bias (i.e. eVGO (cid:28) −∆G), we can
instead approximate Eq. (SE14) neglecting the smallest
of the two barrier heights, i.e. setting ∆O → 0. We find

This expression is the 2D-to-2D equivalent of the Fowler-
Nordheim equationS5. However, in our case, the Fowler-

Nordheim regime is preempted by the depletion of the
interfacial 2DES.

III. ANALYTICAL FITTING PROCEDURE FOR

POSITIVE BIAS

Eq. (SE12) reveals a very complicated dependence of
the tunneling current on applied bias, which hinders the
reproduction of the experimental data through direct fit-
ting; therefore an indirect route was chosen to reproduce
the transport curves, as described in the following for the
representative curve in Fig. 3a in the main text.

We notice that between the noise floor and the on-
for 0.7 < VGO < 1.8 V

set of resistive saturation, i.e.

Sp4

for the particular curve shown in Fig. 3a, the J − VGO
relationship reduces to a simple exponential function, as
indicated by the linear dependence exhibited in the semi-
logarithmic plot. The blue dotted curve in Fig. 3a rep-
resents the best fit to the data in this bias range with a
two-parameter exponential function J = c1 exp(c2VGO),
yielding c1 = 3.6 × 10−5µA/cm2 and c2 = 11 V−1.
To compare this result with our theoretical model, we
need a simplified version of Eq. SE16. To this end, we
notice that for typical values of α ≈ 40 and positive bias
only the first exponential term in Eq. SE16 is relevant,
the second being suppressed by several orders of magni-
tude. Fixing a reference point V ∗ = 1.3 V at the center
of the relevant bias interval and expanding to first order
in VGO − V ∗, we obtain

J ≈ Const(A, α, ¯∆, V ∗)×exp

 αeVGO

(cid:18)

 , (SE18)
(cid:19)
q ¯∆ − eV ∗/2

so that we can identify c2 with αe/
.
We estimate an average barrier height ¯∆ ≈ 2 eV and

4

G , yields ∆G = 2.3 eV;

consequently extract a value of m∗ = 1.5me, which is
significantly larger than previously reported valuesS6,S7.
The barrier is estimated in the following way: combin-
ing the reported electron affinities values of graphene
(4.6 eV)S8 and LAO (2.4 eV)S6,S9 and the experimentally
measured n
furthermore, by
assuming typical values for the conduction band offset
(2 eV) at the oxide interfaceS25, the triangular well con-
finement energy (0.1 − 0.2 eV), the interfacial subband
effective mass mb = me
S1,S6 and using the experimen-
O , we obtain ∆O ≈ 1.8 eV. The pa-

tally measured n
rameters concerning the electrostatics of the junction, i.e
d = 4 nm, r = 15, and the zero bias densities of the two
electron systems were chosen the same as in Fig. 2. With
these parameters, we generated the RT vertical transport
characteristics in the full WKB approximation shown in
dashed red line in Fig. 3a. The curve reproduces qual-
itatively the observed transport behavior in the whole
bias range and is quantitatively accurate in the instrinsic
bias range, providing evidence that the vertical graphene-
oxide transport is dominated by direct tunneling of elec-
trons through the LAO barrier.
