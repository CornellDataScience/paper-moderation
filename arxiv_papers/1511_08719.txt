Abstract

We examine a resonance structure of Floquet state in dynamic fractional Stark ladder (DFSL) realized in biased
semiconductor superlattices driven by a terahertz cw laser on the basis of the R-matrix Floquet theory. To do this, we
calculate an excess density of state ρ(ex)(E) corresponding to lifetime of the Floquet state with a fractional matching
ratio η, where η is the ratio of a Bloch frequency ΩB to a laser frequency ω, namely, η = ΩB/ω. The results for
η = 3/2 demonstrate the appearance of discernibly large peaks associated with Floquet states with longevity in a
region of relatively high laser-intensity. The underlying physics is discussed in terms of an analytical expression of
ρ(ex)(E) and the associated Green function in which ponderomotive couplings are included in a non-perturbative way.

1. Introduction

Control of quantum states by AC electric fields
has attracted considerable attention in condensed mat-
ter physics [1, 2, 3].
In particular, coherent control
of single-electron states in semiconductor superlattices
(SLs) is a longstanding issue.
It can be easily dealt
with as a single-electron problem in a periodic poten-
tial driven by external fields, and has provided fascinat-
ing phenomena. A typical example of the related phe-
nomena is the dynamical Wannier-Stark ladder (DWSL)
in biased semiconductor SLs driven by a terahertz cw
laser[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. As is well known, when a static
electric field F0 is applied to semiconductor SLs with a
lattice constant d, there appears discretized energy lev-
els (Wannier-Stark ladder, abbreviated as WSL) with
a constant energy interval of a Bloch frequency ΩB =
edF0/, where e and  represent the elementary charge
of electron and Planck's constant divided by 2π, respec-
tively. DWSL is the WSL driven by a cw laser with
the frequency ω. The applied laser generally causes the
photon-assisted tunneling (PAT) between discrete WSL

levels, leading to miniband formation accompanied by
delocalized states of electron. On the contrary, at a cer-
tain strength of the laser intensity the formed miniband
is collapsed, resulting in dynamic localization of elec-
trons. Thus, in DWSL, both of the localized and de-
localized states are coherently controlled by altering a
couple of laser parameters.

As stated above, DWSL can be treated as a single-
electron problem and has often been investigated by us-
ing a tight binding model. Here, it should be noted that
the tight binding model only takes account of a few low-
est bound states in quantum wells. In fact, in a real sit-
uation, a strong laser field induces non-negligible cou-
plings not only between these bound states but among
all states including all bound states and continuum
states. The effects caused by these couplings are termed
as ac-Zener tunneling (ac-ZT) effects, and the tight
binding model only partially incorporates the ac-ZT ef-
fects [10, 11]. Some of the present authors and cowork-
ers treat DWSL as a multichannel scattering problem
incorporating all parts of the ac-ZT effects [12, 13], and
investigate the resonances structure of DWSL with inte-
ger numbers of a ratio η = ΩB/ω by virtue of the numer-
ical method based on the R-matrix Floquet theory [14];
η is termed the matching ratio. Here the term "chan-
nel" is associated with a photon-sideband state formed

in DWSL. It is well-known that physical properties of
DWSL are characterized by the ratio η.

DWSL with fractional η = p/q is an objective of the
present study, where p and q are relatively prime num-
bers. Herein, this is called dynamic fractional Stark lad-
der (DFSL) [7]. In particular, we focus on multi-channel
resonance structure of DFSL caused by the ac-ZT effect
in a region of high laser-intensity. According to the pre-
ceding study [15], it is shown that a resonance peak of
DFSL is shifted and broadened by the effect of the ac-
ZT and a fractal pattern characteristic of DFSL [7] does
not necessarily hold. However, this study resorts just to
a single-channel scattering problem without interchan-
nel couplings; this is considered correct just under the
high-frequency approximation with ω → ∞.

We examine the resonance structure of DFSL by re-
sorting to a multichannel scattering problem including
full effects of interchannel couplings. Here, excess den-
sity of states (DOS) [16, 17, 18], ρ(ex)(E), is considered,
which is closely related to the lifetime of the concerned
Floquet state with quasienergy E. The obtained results
are discussed with the idea that ρ(ex)(E) is analytically
(ex)
classified into a single-channel contribution ρ
(E), a
0
(ex)
multichannel non-resonance term ρ
nr (E), and a mul-
(ex)
tichannel resonance term ρ
res (E) [13]. For η = 3/2,
ρ(ex)(E) shows the appearance of a larger number of
new peaks with increasing laser-intensity.
In partic-
ular, we put a stress on that one of these grows into
a new and discernibly intense peak in the vicinity of
the second-lowest level of the WSL with anomalously
long lifetime. As shown later, these phenomena are ex-
plained based on the mechanism of Feshbach-like reso-
nance [19].

2. Theory

The theoretical framework of our study is already de-
scribed in the series of preceding papers [12, 13]. In this
section, we present its brief explanation for readers' un-
derstanding.

We start with the DWSL Hamiltonian,

H(z, t) = "pz +

1
c

A(t)#

1

2m(z) "pz +

1
c

A(t)# + V(z), (1)

where V(z), m(z) and pz represent a confining poten-
tial of a semiconductor SLs, an effective mass of elec-
tron, and a momentum operator along the crystal growth
direction z, respectively.
In addition, A(t) is a vector
potential at time t for an applied electric field F(t) =
− A(t)/c, where c is the speed of light. In the following,

we use the atomic unit. By applying a unitary trans-
formation called the Kramers-Henneberger transforma-
tion [20, 21], the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) is rewritten
as

H(z, t) = pz(

1

2m[z + a(t)]) pz + V[z + a(t)]

+F0z + v(z, t),

(2)

where v(z, t) is a residual interaction caused by the z de-
pendence of the effective mass m(z) [12]. Here, a(t) ≡
αcosωt is the position of a classical electron oscillating
under a laser field F(t) = Faccosωt, and α defined as

α =

Fac
masω2

(3)

is a ponderomotive radius corresponding to the excur-
sion amplitude of a classical electron.
It is remarked
that, in the asymptotic region of z >> LS L, V[z + a(t)]
and m[z + a(t)] become the constant values of Vas and
mas, respectively. Thus, v(z, t) vanishes in the asymp-
totic region. Here LS L represents the size of SL.

The Hamiltonian H(z, t) satisfies the Schrodinger

equation

"H(z, t) − i

∂

∂t# Φ(z, t) = 0,

(4)

and ensures the Floquet theorem (see Appendix A) be-
cause of the temporal periodicity H(z, t + T ) = H(z, t)
with the period T = 2π/ω. Then, the wave function
Φ(z, t) is expressed as

Φ(z, t) = exp (−iEt)

Nph

Xν=−Nph

exp (iνωt)ψν(z),

(5)

and Eq. (4) is reduced into coupled differential equa-
tions for a set of wavefunction {ψν}

Nph

Xν=−NphhLµν(z) − Eδµνi ψν(z) = 0,

(6)

where Nph represents a cut-off of the photon index ν
with Nph >> 1, and Lµν(z) is given by Lµν(z) = Hµν(z) +
νωδµν. Here, the matrix element Oµν(z) is defined as

Oµν(z) =

1

T Z T

0

exp [−i(µ − ν)ωt]O(z, t)dt.

(7)

It is noted that Oµν(z) is a function of α as well as z,
though the notation of α is omitted for the sake of sim-
plicity.

2

In our framework, Eq. (6) can be dealt with as a mul-
tichannel scattering problem, where there are Nch inde-
pendent solutions {ψνβ(z)} with ν, β = 1 ∼ Nch; Nch is
the number of channels defined as Nch = 2Nph + 1 [22].
To be concrete, ψνβ(z) represents the ν-th channel of the
β-th solution. In the asymptotic region of z >> LS L,
the Hamiltonian of Eq. (2) is reduced to

H(z, t) → Has(z) =

p2
z
2mas

+ F0z + Vas

(8)

and thus, the interchannel component of Lµν(z) dimin-
ishes and Lµν(z) becomes

Lµν(z) → (cid:2)Has(z) + νω(cid:3) δµν.

In addition, ψνβ(z)

The scattering matrix S (E) is calculated numeri-
cally by employing the R-matrix propagation tech-
niques [23], and the key value of excess DOS is ob-
tained by

(12)

Here we note that this is also expressed as

ρ(ex)(E) = ρ(E) − ρ(as)(E),

(13)

where ρ(E) represents the DOS of the DWSL, and ρ(as)
(±)
νβ (z). In ad-
is the DOS of a field-free asymptotic state χ
dition, ρ(ex)(E) is related to the lifetime of the concerned
Floquet state with E [16, 17, 18];

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that ρ(ex)(E) can be

written as

ρ(ex)(E) = ρ

(ex)
where ρ

the multichannel non-
single-channel contribution,
resonance term, and the multichannel resonance term,
respectively [13]. The physical meanings of these terms
are clarified by introducing a ponderomotive interaction
Uµν(z) defined as

Uµν(z) = (cid:2)F0z + µω(cid:3) δµν + Vµν(z) + vµν(z),

which includes the effect of ac-ZT. For the convenience
of discussion, Uµν(z) is classified into the single-channel
part

(16)

¯Uµ(z) ≡ Uµµ(z) = F0z + µω + Vµµ(z) + vµµ(z)

(17)

termed the ponderomotive potential [13], and the inter-
channel one

¯Vµν(z) ≡ (1 − δµν)Uµν(z)

(18)

termed the ponderomotive coupling [12].

For small α (i.e. for small Fac), ¯Uµ(z) is dominant,
because ¯Vµν(z) is not dominant. Thus ρ(ex)(E) is dom-
(ex)
inated by ρ
(E) which shows peak spectra of shape-
0
resonance levels supported by ¯Uµ(z) [15]. In particular,
for α ≈ 0

¯Uµ(z) ≈ V(z) + F0z + µω,

(19)
and ¯Vµν(z) ≈ 0. Then Eq. (6) is reduced to a decoupled
(ex)
equation for each ν and ρ(ex)(E) ≈ ρ
(E) shows peaks
0
corresponding to resonance states of the WSL. As α in-
creases, the shape of ¯Uµ(z) is more deformed and ¯Vµν(z)
gradually increases [12]. However the peak structure of
(ex)
(E) is still kept unaltered to some extent.
ρ
0
For larger α, ¯Vµν(z) further develops and accordingly,
the contributions from the interchannel couplings, i.e.,
(ex)
(ex)
nr (E) and ρ
res (E) are expected to become dominant.
ρ
(ex)
Particularly, ρ(ex)(E) is governed by ρ
res (E) for large
(ex)
¯Vµν(z), and it is shown that ρ
res (E) can be approxi-
mately expressed as

ρ(ex)

res (E) = Xβ βi

Bββi(cid:0)E − E βi(cid:1) + Aββi(cid:0)Γ βi /2(cid:1)
+(cid:0)Γ βi/2(cid:1)2
(cid:0)E − E βi(cid:1)2

(20)

with real values Aββi and Bββi. The notation of βi is in-
troduced to represent a set of the indexes (βi, Eβi), where
Eβi represents the quasienergy level associated with the
βi-th single channel equation [13]. As shown later in
detail, according to Eq. (20), in the region of large α,
there is a possibility that ρ(ex)(E) possesses novel spec-
(ex)
(E),
tral peaks which are not attributed to those of ρ
0
where the peak is located at E = E βi with the reso-
(ex)
nance width Γ βi /2. It is seen that the sum of ρ
res (E) and

(ex)
nr (E) is akin to the spectral function of the Shore pro-
ρ
(ex)
file [24] with ρ
nr (E) as a background; this is an absorp-
tion lineshape of Feshbach resonance [19] characteristic
of a multichannel scattering problem. Strictly speak-
(ex)
ing, the resonance mechanism described by ρ
nr (E) and
(ex)
res (E) differs from the original Feshbach resonance
ρ
mechanism in that in the later, a pure discrete state de-
cays into unstructured continuum states, whereas in the
former, a shape-resonance state with relatively narrow
width decays into that with structured continuum states
with large width [12]. Actually, even the lowest level in
WSL is not completely bounded owing to a tilted poten-
(ex)
tial. For this reason, the resonance governed by ρ
nr (E)
(ex)
and ρ
res (E) is termed "Feshbach-like" resonance in this
study.

Finally, we give a comment on the periodicity of
ρ(ex)(E) in DFSL for η = p/q; this quantity ensures the
following periodicity relation in the Brillouin zone with
an interval ω as

ρ(ex)(E) = ρ(ex) E + nω +

k
q

ω!

(21)

with n and k as integers, where k is termed as a split-
subband index in this paper with k = 0, ..., q − 1 [7, 8].
Fig. 1 for η = 3/2 clearly shows the periodicity of con-
cern. Let us assume that a certain potential, namely,
the µ-th potential ¯Uµ(z) associated with channel µ sup-
ports the lowest quasienergy level (b = 1). Then, each
potential of different channel also supports a photon-
sideband at the same well, which results in the period-
icity ρ(ex)(E) = ρ(ex)(E + nω).
In addition, it can be
found that neighboring quantum wells also support the
same lowest level, whose quasienergy levels shift by
ω/2, causing the periodicity ρ(ex)(E) = ρ(ex)(E + ω/2)
for η = 3/2. Both of the periodicity are combined into
the Eq. (21) with q = 2.

3. Results and Discussion

In this section, we present numerical results of
ρ(ex)(E), calculated by using the R-matrix Floquet the-
ory. The numerical calculations are carried out for a
35/11ML-GaAs/Ga0.75Al0.25As SLs (1 ML = 2.83 Å)
with a lattice constant d = 246, where the barrier height
of a confining quantum-well potential is Vb = 7.8×10−3.
The effective masses of electrons in the wells and the
barriers are mw = 0.0665 and mb = 0.0772, respec-
tively [12]. The strength of the applied bias field is set
to F0 = 104.5 kV/cm which corresponds to the Bloch
frequency of ΩB = F0d = 5 × 10−3. The number of
quantum wells is set to Nqw = 20. All the results shown

For η = 3/2, there is one split-subband in the Brillouin zone of length
ω.

here are calculated for Nch = 41, and we have confirmed
that the results sufficiently converge with respect to Nch.
Fig. 2 shows the calculated results of ρ(ex)(E) for
η = p/q = 3/2 from α = 1 to 40. We plot ρ(ex)(E) in one
Brillouin zone ω = ΩB/η = 3.33 · · · × 10−3. In this case,
because of the periodicity of ρ(ex)(E) = ρ(ex)(E + ω/2)
given in Eq. (21), the same structure appears with the in-
terval of ω/2 = 1.66 · · ·×10−3. In the actual calculation,
there are tiny differences, due to numerical inaccuracy
attributed to the finite size of Nqw.

Here, each discernible peak at α = 1 is labeled as
(b, µ, k). The first index b labels the SL-miniband. In the
present condition, the energetically lowest three states
b = 1, 2, and 3 are discernible. The second one µ
is the photon sideband index, and the last index k is
the split-subband index seen in Eq.(21). We also plot
quasienergy positions of the lowest three levels (b = 1,
2 and 3) calculated by the tight binding model with
intra-site ac-ZT, however, without the inter-site hop-
pings [25]. The calculated quasienergy levels using the
tight binding model reproduce peak positions of ρ(ex)(E)
to some extent. In Fig. 2, it is found that ρ(ex)(E) for
η = 3/2 has strong α-dependence. First, most of the
apparent peaks at α = 1 blur with increasing α. Some
of them seem to sharpen again, and then split around
α = 20. The typical examples are the peaks originated
from the b = 2 miniband. For larger α, those split peaks
become more distant from each other. At α = 40, ob-
tained peaks no longer correspond to those at α = 1.

In Fig. 3, we plot ρ(ex)(E) near the peaks (2,-2,1) and

of the peaks in more detail. At α = 5, the peak
(2,-2,1) (labeled "A") becomes blurred. However, for
α = 10 ∼ 15, it is seen that the intense peak (labeled
"A′") is redshifted. As regards the peak (1,-1,1) labeled
"B", it is found that the peak shifts to high-energy side
with the increase in α. For α > 15, both peaks "A′"
and "B" show splitting accompanying new peaks la-
beled "a" and "b", respectively. It is notable that the
new peak "a" abruptly develops for 15 < α ≤ 20, and
then it is rapidly blurred for larger α. At α = 25, the
peaks "A′" and "a" have similar order of peak width
and height. As regards the other new peak "b", by con-
trast, its width still remains broadened after the splitting
from "B". In addition, it is found that the red(blue)shift
of peaks "A" and "A′" (peak "B") is caused by the inter-
channel coupling partially included in the tight binding
model.

The behavior of the peaks seen in Fig. 3 can be
analyzed on the basis of the analytical expression of
ρ(ex)(E). As explained in the last section, the spec-
tral peak attributed to the ponderomotive coupling
¯Vµν(z) is expressed as the Feshbach-like resonance pro-
(ex)

res (E). On the other

file composed of ρ

hand, the rest, i.e., ρ
(E), corresponds to the shape-
0
resonance profile resulting from the ponderomotive po-
(ex)
tential ¯Uµ(z). For the purpose of comparison, ρ
(E)
0
is also calculated by the R-matrix Floquet theory with
¯Vµν(z) = 0, plotted by blue dashed lines in Fig. 3. We

can see that the broadening of the peak "A" from α = 1
to 5 and the slight blueshift of the peak "B" are qualita-
tively consistent with tendency of the calculated results

of ρ
(E). By contrast, in the region of 10 ≤ α < 20,

It would be certain that the novel peaks "a" and "b"
for 20 ≤ α ≤ 25 are also due to the Feshbach-like
resonance mechanism. Now, the origin of such new-
peak appearance is brought to light based on the to-
tal Green function projected onto a closed channel, de-
noted as G(E); this is associated with the denominator
of the Shore profile of Eq.(20) [24]. The Green func-
tion is formally expressed as G(E) = 1/(E − E0 − Σ(E)),
where E0 and Σ(E) represent an unperturbed energy and
a self-energy at quasienergy E, respectively. It is noted
that both energy and width of the Feshbach-like reso-
nance are determined by poles of G(E) [24] in the lower-
half complex E-plane. That is, the real part of a pole
of G(E) gives the resonance energy and the imaginary
part gives the resonance width. In the present system,
Σ(E) includes the effect of the ponderomotive coupling
¯Vµν(z) [13] in a non-perturbative manner. When ¯Vµν(z)
is small, Σ(E) can be treated perturbatively, and thus

5

G(E) has a single pole at E ≈ E0 + Σ(E0). However,
when ¯Vµν(z) is strong enough, a non-perturbative treat-
ment is necessary, and it is required to solve the tran-
scendental equation of E = E0 + Σ(E) to determine
resonance poles; the solutions generally correspond to
multiple poles of G(E). Such a scenario suggests that a
(ex)
Feshbach-like resonance peak originated from ρ
res (E)
would split into a larger number of peaks with the in-
crease in α. In particular, the peak splitting of "A′" and
"a" can be interpreted that a single pole of G(E) in the
region of α ≤ 15 bifurcates in the region of α ≥ 20.

Next, a stress is put on that the peak "a" at α = 20
has extremely small Γ βi. This seems to manifest itself
under a particular condition that one of the two poles
exists in the vicinity of a real axis in the lower-half com-
plex E-plane. In general, it is known that spectral peaks
are more broaden as the strength of an applied laser in-
creases because of a power-broadening mechanism due
to a strong non-linear optical effect [26]. Therefore,
the irregularity observed here in spectral peak should be
distinct from such a conventional understanding. Ac-
cording to our calculation, such anomalous behavior is
ensured just in the development of peak "a".

Figure 4: The height of the peaks labeled in Fig. 3.

For the purpose of more quantitative discussion, the
height of the labeled peaks "A", "A′", "B", "a", and "b"
are plotted in Fig. 4. It is seen that the peak "A′" de-
velop for α ≥ 10 and reaches the maximum with the
peak height of 1.7 × 105 at α = 15. For α > 15, the
peak "a" develops prominently with the highest peak at
α = 20. The maxima of the peak height of "A′" and "a"
reach about 1.7 × 105 and 2.2 × 105, respectively; that
is, the lifetime of the peak "A′" is 0.10 ps and that of
"a" is 0.13 ps. These values are much larger than that
of typical resonance peaks for η = 1 [27], where a pon-
deromotive coupling is expected to be stronger than that
in the present case of η = 3/2. In this sense, we con-

sider the manifestation of the new stable Floquet state
obtained here as anomalous effect.

Figure 5: (Color online) The excess DOS ρ(ex)(E) for 5/2

We also calculated ρ(ex)(E) for larger η = 5/3 and
5/2. However, such novel peaks attributed to the
Feshbach-like resonance are not found. Here we plot
in Fig. 5 the results of ρ(ex)(E) for η = 5/2; though
those for η = 5/3 are not shown here. It is found that
resonance peaks show just monotonic behavior in both
energy-shift and width in contrast to those for η = 3/2;
this is consistent with results of DWSL with larger in-
tegers of η > 1. This is because the effect of ¯Vµν(z) be-
comes negligibly smaller as η increases [13], and thus
the contribution from ρ

(ex)
res (E) is less dominant.

4. Conclusion

In this study, we examine the resonance structure of
DFSL in terms of excess DOS, ρ(ex)(E), by employ-
ing the R-matrix Floquet theory. The behavior of the
obtained results of ρ(ex)(E) is discussed by use of the
analytical expression, where this is classified into the
(ex)
single-channel contribution ρ
(E), the multichannel
0
(ex)
nr (E), and the multichannel reso-
non-resonance term ρ
nance term ρ

(ex)
res (E).

It is found that the ac-ZT included in the pondero-
motive couplings plays an important role of the spec-
tral property of ρ(ex)(E) for η = 3/2, where an ir-
regular pattern of it, especially, an anomalous Floquet
state with longevity manifests itself. The underlying
physics of this manifestation is discussed in the light of
the Feshbach-like resonance profile described by both

(ex)
(ex)
nr (E) and ρ
res (E), and poles of the associated Green
ρ
function G(E). In particular, the peak splitting of "A′"
and "a" at α = 20 seems to result from the bifurca-
tion of pole of G(E) due to the non-perturbative effect
of ¯Vµν(z). Further, the origin of the narrow width of the
peak "a" at α = 20 is also discussed in terms of G(E).
On the other hand, long-lived states are generally ex-
tremely rare in such a high laser-intensity region due to
the effect of power-broadening. Actually, such anoma-
lous peaks are not observed for other η's to the best of
one's knowledge.

Finally, we give a comment on a possibility of exper-
imental observation of the finding obtained here. The
laser intensity at α = 20 for η = 3/2 is Fac = 88 kV/cm,
where the prominent peak of "a" is discerned. This is
feasible strength of the terahertz cw laser in experiments
at present [28], and thus it apparently seems that the cor-
responding peak might be observed in semiconductor
SLs. However, in actual experiments, the peak would be
smeared by various sorts of broadening mechanisms due
to impurities, many-body interactions, lattice imperfec-
tion, lattice vibration, and so on. Therefore, a more ideal
system is preferred. One possible candidate is an opti-
cal SLs composed of cold atomic gas [9, 29, 30], where
these perturbations would be suppressed to a great ex-
tent, and thus, the quantum phenomenon of concern is
expected to be realized.

Appendix A. Floquet theorem

In this appendix, we provide a brief introduction of
the Floquet theorem [2]. Let us consider a system whose
Hamiltonian H(z, t) has the time-periodicity

H(z, t + T ) = H(z, t).

(A.1)

According to the Floquet theorem, there is a solution of
the Schodinger equation (4) in the form

Ψ(z, t) = e−iEtΨ′(z, t),

(A.2)

where Ψ′(z, t) is the Floquet wavefunction, which satis-
fies the periodicity

Ψ′(z, t + T ) = Ψ′(z, t),

(A.3)

7

and E is the quasienergy. Then we substitute a Fourier
expansion of the time-periodic function

Ψ′(z, t) =

∞

Xν=−∞

exp (iνωt)ψν(z)

(A.4)

into Eq. (A.2) and obtain Eq. (5).
In actual calcula-
tion, the summation of the index ν is limited in the finite
range from −Nph to Nph.

[22] Exactly speaking, Nch in this paper must be replaced by No, the
number of open channels. Here a open channel labeled by ν is
a channel with (E − νω − F0z − Vas) > 0 in the asymptotic
region. Then the solution of the asymptotic equation (11) is a
progressive wave. In actual calculations, the number of channels
Nch = 2Nph + 1 is finite, and thus all the channels can become
the open channels in the asymptotic region of z >> LS L with
negative z. So we can set Nch = No. For more detail, consult
Refs. [16, 17, 18].

[25] The tight-binding model used here is basically same as that of
Ref. [13]. The difference is that the nearest-neighbor inter-site
(well) hoppings are neglected in this work. For the DFSL, the
coupling is negligibly small because the photon-assisted tunnel-
ing between nearest wells does not occurs since ω , ΩB
