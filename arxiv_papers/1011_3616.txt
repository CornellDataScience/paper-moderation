Abstract

We analyze the critical behavior of the dephasing rate induced by short-range
electron-electron interaction near an Anderson transition of metal-insulator or quan-
tum Hall type. The corresponding exponent characterizes the scaling of the transi-
tion width with temperature. Assuming no spin degeneracy, the critical behavior can
be studied by performing the scaling analysis in the vicinity of the non-interacting
fixed point, since the latter is stable with respect to the interaction. We combine
an analytical treatment (that includes the identification of operators responsible for
dephasing in the formalism of the non-linear sigma-model and the corresponding
renormalization-group analysis in 2 + ǫ dimensions) with numerical simulations on
the Chalker-Coddington network model of the quantum Hall transition. Finally, we
discuss the current understanding of the Coulomb interaction case and the available
experimental data.

Introduction

Localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions form a broad and ac-
tively developing field of condensed matter physics, see Ref. [1] for a recent
review. In particular, the electron-electron interaction effects at the transition
represent one of central research directions [2,3,4,5,6,7].

Quite generally, the impact of interaction onto low-temperature transport and
localization in disordered electronic systems can be subdivided into effects of
(i) renormalization and (ii) dephasing. The renormalization effects, whose role
in diffusive systems was investigated by Altshuler and Aronov [2], are governed
by virtual processes and become increasingly more pronounced with lowering
temperature. Finkelstein developed a renormalization-group (RG) approach
[3] in the framework of the non-linear σ-model in order to treat these effects
together with localization phenomena. More recently, this research direction
attracted a great deal of attention in connection with experiments on high-
mobility low-density electronic structures (Si MOSFETs) giving an evidence
in favor of a metal-insulator transition [6,7,8]. It was shown that this transi-
tion can be explained in the framework of the σ-model RG for a system with
N > 1 valleys [9] (formally N should be large but in practice N = 2, as in
Si, is already sufficient). Indeed, a detailed analysis has confirmed that the
RG theory describes well the experimental data up to lowest accessible tem-
peratures [10,11]. Very recently, it was shown [12] that interaction effects are
also of crucial importance in topological insulators, where they induce novel
critical states. Another long-standing issue in the field concerns the interplay
of interaction and multifractality of wave functions at Anderson transitions.
This problem has been recently addressed in the context of superconductivity
near the mobility edge. Focussing on the short-range interaction in the Cooper
channel, Ref. [13] predicted that the multifractality of critical wave functions
strongly enhances the superconducting pairing correlations.

Dephasing effects are governed by inelastic processes of electron-electron scat-
tering at finite temperature T . The dephasing has been studied in great detail
for metallic systems where it provides a cutoff for weak-localization effects
[2]. As to Anderson localization transitions, dephasing leads to their smear-
ing at finite temperature. The dephasing-induced transition width scales as a
power-law function of T . In the case of quantum Hall transition, this scaling
of the transition width, ∆B ∝ T κ, has been experimentally explored in many
works. While the value of κ was a matter of controversy, there seems to be
a consensus now that the results κ = 0.42 ± 0.04 [14], κ = 0.42 ± 0.01 [15]
properly characterize the quantum Hall transition (when it is not masked by
macroscopic inhomogeneities). Scaling near the transition with varying tem-
perature was also experimentally studied at the 3D Anderson transition in
doped semiconductors [16,17].

2

In this paper we study the scaling properties of dephasing rate at criticality.
We consider the situation when the time-reversal invariance is broken, so that
the system belongs to the so-called unitary symmetry class. In particular, the
quantum Hall transition belongs to this symmetry class. We further assume,
following Refs. [18,19] that the interaction is of short-range character. This
greatly simplifies the analysis, since in this case the interaction is irrelevant
in the RG sense [4,18,20], so that all scaling properties at the transition are
governed by the RG flow near the non-interacting fixed point. The goals of
this work are as follows. First, we identify the operators controlling the de-
phasing within the framework of the non-linear σ-model. Second, we perform
the RG analysis of these operators for the σ-model in 2 + ǫ dimensions. Third,
we present a numerical investigation of the corresponding wave function cor-
relation functions by using the Chalker-Coddington network as a a model of
the quantum Hall transition. Finally, we make conclusions concerning the ex-
ponent κ governing the temperature scaling of the transition and discuss the
current understanding of the Coulomb interaction case, as well as relations
between the theoretical and experimental findings.

is assumed to describe a system with broken time-reversal invariance (unitary
symmetry class) at criticality. This may be a 2D system near quantum Hall
transition (in which case B = rotA is a uniform magnetic field), or a system in
d > 2 dimensions at the Anderson transition point (with a uniform or random
magnetic field B(r) breaking the time reversal invariance). The interaction
part of the Hamiltonian H has the form

2.2 First-order correction to the thermodynamic potential

Following Ref. [18], we begin by considering the first order interaction correc-
tion to the thermodynamic potential. The corresponding diagrams are shown
in Fig. 1; their total contribution reads

where nf (ǫ) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, φα(r) and ǫα are exact eigenfunc-
tions and eigenenergies of the non-interacting Hamiltonian (2), and

Bαβ(r1, r2) = φα(r1)φβ(r2) − φα(r2)φβ(r1).
After averaging over disorder, the contribution (4) becomes

describes correlations of two eigenstates of the non-interacting Hamilto-
nian (2). In general, for the system size L → ∞, the function K1 exhibits

where Lω = L(∆/ω)1/d is the length scale set by the frequency ω. For two
adjacent in energy eigenstates one has ω ∼ ∆ and Lω ∼ L, for larger frequen-
cies the scale Lω is much less than L. It is important that the exponent µ2 is
positive, µ2 > 0, due to Hartree-Fock antisymmetrization of wave functions in
Eq. (5). This means that for distances shorter than Lω the correlation function
(8) is suppressed at criticality as compared to the metallic system. This should
be contrasted to multifractal correlations of wave functions (without antisym-
metrization) that are enhanced at criticality. We will discuss this point and,
more generally, the spectrum of critical exponents within the σ-model frame-
work in Sec. 3.

We assume the electron-electron interaction of the following form:

U(R) = u0(cid:20)1 + (R/a)2(cid:21)−λ/2

with λ > d. This yields

(11)

Following Ref. [18], we can consider u(Lω) as renormalized interaction param-
eter. It is seen that for λ > d the electron-electron interaction is indeed irrele-
vant near non-interacting fixed point u = 0. While the above calculations are
based on evaluation of the Hartree-Fock contribution to the thermodynamic
potential, this conclusion is in agreement with the analysis of Ref. [20] based
on Finkelstein non-linear σ-model.

2.3 Dephasing rate: Second-order correction to the electron self-energy

In order to compute the dephasing rate (or, more accurately, the out-scattering
rate which in this case coincides with the dephasing rate), one needs to evaluate
the second-order interaction correction to the imaginary part of the self-energy
(see Fig. 2). In spirit of Ref. [21], we define the self-energy of a given single-

Since we consider the situation at criticality, where fluctuations may be strong,
the averaging is not always an innocent procedure. We will return to the
justification of the averaging in Sec. 4.4.

To determine the scaling of the dephasing rate, we now specify characteristic
values of energy variables. First of all, we are interested in dephasing at the
mass shell (E = ε) and at characteristic energy E ∼ T . Since we are not
aiming at calculating the numerical prefactor of order unity, we can simply
set E = 0. Second, we will see that the characteristic values of the integral
variables ε′ and Ω are set by the temperature. Performing integration of the
Fermi-function factor over energy ε′, we find

In order to proceed further, we need to know the scaling behavior of the
function K2. Assuming that ε′ ∼ Ω (this is sufficient for our purposes, as both
these frequencies are of order of temperature), we have for r1−r2,r3−r4 ≪
R 6 LΩ the scaling form [18]

where R = (r1 + r2 − r3 − r4)/2. The scaling behavior (17) can be motivated
as follows. At distances R ∼ LΩ the correlations between wave functions
at r1,2, on one hand, and r3,4, on the other hand, decouple. Thus, scaling
of K2 reduces to that of a product of two independent correlators K1, i.e.,
(r1 − r2/R)µ2(r3 − r4)/R)µ2. The exponent α describes the scaling with
respect to a remaining scaling variable R/LΩ. For R ≫ LΩ the correlations
quickly (exponentially) decay, so that this range of R is not important for the
integral.

Combining Eqs. (16) and (17), we obtain

The result of integration over R depends on the relations between λ, µ2, α

d − 2µ2 + α < 0.

d − 2µ2 + α = 0,

d − 2µ2 + α < 0.

Finally, if λ < d + µ2, we get

3d − 2λ + α = 0,

3d − 2λ + α < 0.

Here δ = 1/νdad is the ultraviolet energy cutoff.

(20)

(21)

For α ≤ −d, the integration over Ω is dominated by the infrared cutoff which
should be chosen self-consistently at 1/τϕ, yielding

α = −d,

(22)

Thus, the temperature behavior of the dephasing rate depends on the expo-
nents µ2 and α as well as on dimensionality d and the index λ characterizing
the decay of interaction. The exponents µ2 and α belong to a set of exponents
characterizing correlations of wave functions at criticality; their values depend
on the particular critical point under consideration. In the next section we rep-
resent the correlation function K2 in terms of the operators in the non-linear
sigma model. This will allow us to substantiate the above scaling arguments
by the RG analysis and to evaluate the necessary exponents within the 2 + ǫ
expansion.

3 Field theoretical approach to wave function correlations

3.1 Non-linear sigma model

The effective theory characterizing long-distance low-energy physics of a dis-
ordered electronic system is the non-linear σ-model [22]. We will use its replica
version; the same calculations can be performed in the supersymmetric formu-
lation. The field variable of the theory is the matrix field Q(r) of size 2n× 2n
that obeys the non-linear constraint Q2(r) = 1. The non-linear sigma model

8

action has the form

Sσ[Q] = −

8 Z dr tr(∇Q)2 +

gh2

4 Z dr tr QΛ ,

where

Λ = 


1n
0
0 −1n

.




(23)

(24)

The parameter g in front of the kinetic term is identified with the dimension-
less longitudinal conductance (in units of e2/h). In the RG framework, it is
interpreted as a running coupling constant of the theory. The second term
in Eq. (23), which breaks the U(2n) symmetry down to U(n) × U(n), nor-
mally has an imaginary prefactor proportional to frequency ε. We choose the
constant in front of this term to be real, which is more convenient for RG
analysis.

In the case of a 2D system in transverse magnetic field, there is an additional
contribution to the action that has a form of the topological term [23]

Stop[Q] =

θ

8π Z dr tr Q∇xQ∇yQ .

(25)

The angle θ in front of the topological term is given by the fractional part of
the 2πgxy, where gxy stands for the dimensionless Hall conductivity (in units
e2/h) [24].

We now proceed by expressing the correlation function K2 in terms of eigen-
operators of the σ-model. This calculation is only based on the symmetry of
the theory, so it is equally applicable to the quantum Hall transition in 2D
and to the Anderson transition in d > 2 dimensions.

3.2 Expression for K2 in terms of the eigenoperators

It is convenient to express first the function K2 in terms of the exact single-
particle Green's function GR,A

ε+Ω(r1, r3) Im GR

(26)

In order to extract the exponent α,
it is enough to consider scaling of
K2({rj}, 0, 0, 0, 0) with the system size L for fixed rj − rk. Then, following

9

standard steps (see e.g. Ref. [25]), we obtain

K2({rj}, 0, 0, 0, 0) =

+ tr(cid:20)ΛQab(r1)ΛQbc(r4)ΛQcd(r2)ΛQda(r3)(cid:21)+

(27)

Here γ = (πνd)−1, the symbol tr stands for the trace over retarded-advanced
space only and h. . .i denotes the averaging with the σ-model action Sσ. It is
important to stress that the replica indices a, b, c, d are fixed and different: a 6=
b 6= c 6= d. It reflects the fact that we are dealing with four different eigenstates.
When deriving Eq. (27), we have assumed that all distances rj − rk exceed
the mean free path, so that the averaged Green's functions between any two
points can be neglected. (This assumption does not affect the scaling but
simplifies calculations.) On the other hand, we can think about all points as
located close to each other from the point of view of the σ-model (say, on
the scale of several mean free paths), so that we omit space argument of Q
matrices in what follows.

In view of the presence of the fixed replica indices, Eq. (27) is not convenient
for further computations with the action Sσ which is U(n) × U(n) invariant.
In order to obtain a more convenient, U(n) × U(n) invariant expression, we
use the fact that the correlation function is invariant with respect to global
unitary rotations in the replica space. This allows us to average the expression
in angular brackets in Eq. (27) over such global unitary rotations. In general,
the U(n) × U(n) invariant operators of the kth order in Q matrices have the
form Oλ = Tr(ΛQ)k1 . . . Tr(ΛQ)km, where λ = {k1, . . . , km} is a partition of
the number k = k1 + . . . + km, such that k1 ≥ k2 . . . ≥ km. In particular, for
k = 1 we have one operator, {1}, for k = 2 two operators {2} and {1, 1}, for
k = 3 three operators {3}, {2, 1}, and {1, 1, 1}, for k = 4 five operators {4},
{3, 1}, {2, 2}, {2, 1, 1}, and {1, 1, 1, 1}, and so on.

Since the correlator K2, Eq. (27), contains four Q matrices, after the averaging
over U(n) × U(n) global rotations the result is expressed in terms of the
invariant operators of even orders ≤ 4, i.e. with k = 4 and k = 2 (and in
addition a constant term corresponding to k = 0). Specifically, we obtain (see
Appendix B)

While the operators Oj[Q] are explicitly invariant with respect to the U(n) ×
U(n) symmetry group of the σ-model, they are not eigenoperators of the renor-
malization group. The eigenoperators that are linear combinations of Oj[Q] are
in fact fully determined by the symmetry group (and realize its different repre-
sentations, similarly to conventional spheric function realizing representations
of the rotation group) [29]. The seven RG eigenoperators can be enumerated
by Young frames: P4, P3,1, P2,2, P2,1,1, P1,1,1,1, P2, and P1,1 [30,31]. To express
these RG eigenoperators in terms of basis operators Oj[Q] one can use the
results of Refs. [31,32] or the one-loop renormalization [30,26]. Finally, using
Eq. (28) we represent the correlation function K2 as a linear combination of

11

the eigenoperators of RG,

(44)

It is remarkable that only three eigenoperators (out of seven) enter the ob-
tained expression for the correlation function K2. The eigenoperators P4, P3,1
and P2 with leading singularities in the replica limit n = 0 do not contribute
to K2.

4.1 Anderson transition in 2 + ǫ dimensions

In d = 2 + ǫ dimensions with small ǫ the Anderson transition takes place
at large dimensionless conductance g. This allows one to explore the critical
behavior within the ǫ-expansion. The β-function governing the renormalization
of the conductance is known up to the five-loop order [27,28]

point:

(54)
The anomalous dimensions of the operators P2,1,1 and P1,1,1,1 are negative,
whereas γP2,2 vanishes within the known accuracy:

α = max{−γP2,2(t⋆),−γP2,1,1(t⋆),−γP1,1,1,1(t⋆)}.

α = O(ǫ5/2).

(55)

Therefore, in the case λ > d + √2ǫ (for brevity we keep here only the leading,
one-loop, contribution to µ2), the temperature behavior of the dephasing rate

13

is given by

In the special case λ = d + √2ǫ,

ln2(δ/T ).

(56)

(57)

Only in the regime d < λ < d+√2ǫ, the temperature behavior of the dephasing
rate is determined by the exponent λ:

1

τϕ ∝ δu2(a)(cid:18)T

δ (cid:19)−1+2λ/d

.

(58)

Let us focus on the case of the "most short-range" interaction, λ > d + µ2,
when τ−1
φ ∝ T p with p = 1 + 2µ2/d. The scaling of the dephasing length is
then given by

Lφ ∝ T −1/zT ;

zT =

d

=

d

1 + 2µ2/d

.

(59)

The exponent zT belongs to a class of dynamical critical exponents, as it
governs the scaling of a characteristic length scale (dephasing length) with
a variable having the dimension of energy. It is worth emphasizing that the
localization probems possess rich physics and are in general characterized by
several dynamical exponents. This fact has not always been appreciated in
the literature. In the present case, one should distinguish the exponent zT
controlling the scaling with temperature from the exponent z governing the
scaling with frequency. The latter exponent has a trivial (non-interacting)
value z = d for the short-range interaction.

The transition width induced by inelastic scattering scales as T κ, where the
exponent κ is found by comparison of the dephasing length (59) with the
localization (correlation) length ξ ∝ P − Pc−ν, where P is the parameter,
driving the transition (e.g., electron concentration or disorder strength). This
yields

κ =

(60)

Substituting the above formulas for µ2 and ν, we get the following results for
the dynamical exponent zT and for the index κ up to four-loop order of the
ǫ-expansion:

zT = 2 − 2√2ǫ1/2 + 5ǫ − 4√2ǫ3/2 + O(ǫ2) ;
κ = ǫ + √2ǫ3/2 + ǫ2 + ǫ5/2/√2 + O(ǫ3) .

Fig. 3. Hartree and Fock contributions to the wave function correlator K1 as defined
in Eq. (7) for pairs of wavefunctions neighboring in energy. It is seen that in the
scaling regime both correlation functions follow the same power law, including the
exponent and the amplitude. The corresponding exponent ∆2 ≃ −0.52 is known
from the multifractal analysis [1].

4.2 Integer quantum Hall transition

We have employed numerical techniques in order to calculate K1,2 and the
corresponding exponents for the quantum Hall transition. Our computations
are based on the Chalker-Coddington network. We extract eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions near zero (pseudo)energy from large square systems. In the
present context the system size L is parametrized with the number of links
N = 512, 768, 1024 in each direction. Typically of the order of 104 wavefunc-
tions enter the ensemble average for the correlators K1,2.
In Fig. 3 we show separately two correlation functions (Hartree and Fock
terms), the difference of which constitutes the wave function correlator K1
defined in Eq. (7). It is nicely seen that in the scaling regime of point separation
r1 − r2 much smaller than the system size N both correlation functions
follow the same power law. The corresponding exponent is well known from
the multifractal analysis of moments of wave functions, ∆2 ≃ −0.52. It is
important that not only the exponent but also the prefactor is the same. This
ensures that the difference between the two correlation functions scales with
another (subleading) exponent µ2.

Figure 4 shows the correlator K1 representing the difference of the two func-
tions shown in the previous plot, Fig. 3. As emphasized above, the leading
power-law contributions to the Hartree and Fock terms cancel, so that K1 is

3. The leading power laws cancel and K1 is determined by the subleading contribu-
tions. Two types of deviations from pure power-law behavior (straight line in the
double-log scale) are seen. At small distances the data collapse is not perfect due to
corrections to scaling originating from the ultraviolet cutoff scale (lattice constant).
At large distances deviations from the power-law scaling are caused by r1 − r2
approaching N . The extracted value of the power-law exponent is µ2 ≃ 0.62 ± 0.05.
determined by subleading contributions. For a pure power-law scaling behavior
we would have a straight line in the double logarithmic scale. We observe two
types of deviations from this behavior. At large distances (r1 − r2/N & 0.1)
there is a considerable curvature which is related to higher subleading terms.
At small distances the data collapse is not perfect due to deviations from
scaling related to the ultraviolet cutoff scale (lattice constant) a which leads
to emergence of an additional scaling parameter a/r1 − r2. The numerical
analysis yields the power-law exponent µ2 ≃ 0.62 ± 0.05.
In Fig. 5 we show the correlation function K2 at fixed small distance between
pairs of the points, r1 − r2 = r3 − r4 ≡ ρ, as a function of the distance
R between the pairs. When the system size N increases, the data approach a
straight line, corresponding to a power-law dependence on R with the exponent
≃ 1.25. This exponent is equal to 2µ2 within the uncertainty of our numerical
analysis. Therefore, within our accuracy the exponent α defined in Eq. (17) is
indistinguishable from zero.

The above result on the exponent α is further supported by Fig. 6 where
the correlation function K2 is plotted as a function of R/N for fixed ρ/R.
According to Eq. (17), this is a direct way to determine the exponent α. We
see that at R/N . 0.1 the plots are almost flat, which implies α ≃ 0. At small

shown for a quartett of neighboring energies. The average is over 106 samples with
two quartetts selected for each sample; the error bars give one standard deviation
to indicate the residual statistical uncertainty. It is seen that with increasing N
the data approach the straight line, corresponding to a power-law dependence. The
corresponding exponent is ≃ 1.25, i.e. equal to 2µ2 within the numerical uncertainty,
implying that α ≃ 0.
R we observe again the deviations from scaling controlled by the parameter
a/ρ, as demonstrated in the inset.

To make the scaling properties of K2 particularly clear, we replot in the left
panel of Fig. 7 the data of Fig. 6, multiplying each trace by (ρ/R)−2µ2 with
2µ2 = 1.25. It is seen that all data (full symbols) collapse on a single-parameter
scaling curve showing the dependence of K2(ρ/R)−2µ2 on R/N. This confirms
that the value of µ2 is correct. The open symbols show the data points for three
smallest values of ρ; they deviate from the scaling curve due to corrections in
a/ρ. The plateau of the single-parameter scaling curve at small values of R/N
yields α ≃ −0.05± 0.1 (see the inset in the left panel of Fig. 7 where the same
data are shown on a log-log scale). 1 The single-parameter scaling curve is
also shown in the right panel of Fig. 7 on the double-linear scale.

To summarize, we have found the values µ2 ≃ 0.62± 0.05 and α ≃ −0.05± 0.1
1 Extracting the bounds on possible values for α from our numerical data is com-
plicated by the fact that, within the system sizes available to us, corrections in a/ρ
and R/L are not negligible, see inset of Fig. 6 and the discussion at the end of this
section 4.2. The uncertainty in numerical determination of µ2 enters the scaling
analysis (Fig. 7) as an additional source of uncertainty in α.

∝ (R/N )α for R/N ≪ 1. This scaling behavior is represented by a plateau at inter-
mediate values of R/N , yielding α close to zero. At larger R/N we see deviations
from a straight line, since other contributions (scaling with higher irrelevant expo-
nents) become significant. At small R deviations from the data collapse are due to
corrections in a/ρ. Inset: same data replotted as a function of R/a. At small dis-

for the critical exponents describing the correlation functions of interest. These
values nicely agree with those previously obtained by Lee and Wang [18]. It
should be stressed, however, that we used systems of a linear size an order of
magnitude larger than in Ref. [18]. The large system sizes N & 500 were cru-
cially important for our scaling analysis shown in Fig. 7. Indeed, it is seen there
that the scaling function reaches the expected power-law behavior ∝ (R/N)α
(with α close to zero) only at relatively small values of the scaling argument,
R/N . 0.05. On the other hand, the scale ρ cannot be too small, since the cor-
rections controlled by the parameter a/ρ become substantial unless ρ/a & 4.
Finally, we have a condition R ≫ ρ, which in practice requires that R/ρ & 2.
Combining all this, we see that in order to have a window of good power-law
scaling, we need N considerably larger than 2 × 4 × 20 = 160. Our system
sizes reasonably satisfy this requirement. As a result, we get a window of R/N
approximately between 0.007 and 0.05, where the required scaling takes place.
On the other hand, relatively small system sizes did not allow the authors of
Ref. [18] to obtain this scaling window. Indeed, their Fig. 2 shows a function
that changes by several orders of magnitude without any developed saturation

plateau. While the authors of Ref. [18] argued correctly in favor of small α, it
seems difficult to make a reliable conclusion concerning α with only data for
small systems (as shown in their Fig. 2) at hand.

Using the obtained values of µ2 and α, we can calculate the exponents con-
trolling the interaction effects, see Eqs. (59) and (60). Assuming the case of
"most short-range interaction", λ > 2 + µ2 ≃ 2.62, we get
κ ≃ 0.346 .

zT ≃ 1.23 ;

p ≃ 1.62 ;

(63)

While calculating κ in Eq. (63), we used the value of the localization length
exponent, ν ≃ 2.35 found by Huckestein and coauthors (see the review [33])
and confirmed by several later works. Recently, Slevin and Ohtsuki [34] recon-
sidered the problem and concluded that corrections to scaling are much larger
that was previously thought. As a result, they obtained a larger value of the
localization length critical exponent, ν ≃ 2.59. If this value as used, we get a
somewhat smaller result for the exponent κ,

κ ≃ 0.314 .

(64)

We will compare these values to existing experimental results in Sec. 5, where
we will also discuss expected modifications in the case of Coulomb interaction.

4.3 Anderson transition in d = 3 and higher dimensions

For the Anderson transition in d = 3 the ǫ-expansion cannot give quantita-
tively reliable predictions for critical exponents. Therefore, one has to rely
on numerical simulations. The critical exponent of the localization length for
the unitary symmetry class was found to be ν = 1.43 ± 0.04 [35]. While the
most relevant multifractal exponents (characterizing the scaling of moments
of wave function amplitudes) ∆q have been extensively studied, no numerical
analysis of the subleading exponents, in partiuclar µ2 and α, has been done to
the best of our knowledge. This is an interesting direction for future research.
In particular, an intriguing question is whether the condition d − 2µ2 + α > 0
becomes violated in 3D (or, more generally at sufficiently high dimensional-
ity). According to Eq. (19), this would result in a change of the behavior of
the dephasing rate 1/τφ that would become dependent on the exponent α.

4.4 Discussion: Consistency of the calculation of the dephasing rate and the

transition width

Having completed the calculation of the dephasing rate and of the localization
transition width, we have to come back to the assumptions made in course of
the calculation and check their consistency. Specifically, we have made two im-
portant assumptions: on the averaging procedure and on the critical character
of the wave functions involved.

4.4.1 Critical character of wave functions

When we calculated the dephasing rate as the imaginary part of the self energy
Im Σ(E, ε), we assumed that the zero energy (i.e. the position of the chemical
potential µ) is exactly at the critical point. On the other hand, the obtained
transition width scales as ∝ T κ with κ < 1, i.e. it is much larger than T .
Therefore, it is important to check that finite deviation of µ from criticality,
µ − µc ∝ T κ does not invalidate the calculation. This detuning from criti-
cality will produce a characteristic scale (localization or correlation length),
ξµ ∝ µ − µc−ν that determines the range of critical behavior of correlation
functions. Inserting here µ − µc ∝ T κ, we get ξµ ∝ T −1/zT , which is just the
condition ξµ = Lφ that we used to determine the transition width. Therefore,
for characteristic detuning from critical energy ∼ µ − µc the critical corre-
lations extend up to Lφ ∝ T −1/zT . On the other hand, the range of spatial
integration in Eq. (18) was set by the thermal length LT ∝ T −1/d. We thus
have to compare Lφ and LT . Since zT < d, we have Lφ ≫ LT , which justifies
the calculation.

20

4.4.2 Averaging of dephasing rate

While evaluating τφ, we have performed averaging over the disorder realiza-
tions. A natural question to ask is whether this is a valid procedure. Indeed,
we know that in the localized phase such an averaging breaks down with low-
ering temperature [36] since the level spacing of those states with which the
given state is coupled becomes larger than the averaged dephasing rate. As
a consequence the Golden-rule calculation of the dephasing rate that treats
these states essentially as a continuum breaks down. However, in the critical
regime we are considering the situation is essentially different. As we discussed
in Sec. 4.4.1, the localization length ξµ, which is equal to the dephasing Lφ,
increases (with lowering temperature) faster than T −1/d. As a result, the num-
ber of states contributing to the dephasing rate of a given state -- i.e. of states
located in the energy interval of width T and in the spatial volume (area for
d = 2) of extension ξµ = Lφ ∝ T −1/zT increases as a power law with decreasing
T . In this situation, the dephasing rate τφ is a self-averaging quantity.

4.4.3 Other possible contributions to dephasing

Strictly speaking, what we have calculated in this paper is the lowest-order
(golden rule) dephasing rate governed by the generic range of frequencies (Ω ∼
ε′ ∼ T ). Thus, putting it rigoristically, we have calculated the upper bound on
Lφ, and, consequently, the lower bound on zT and upper bound on κ. Indeed,
formally one cannot exclude the possibility that a contribution of a different
scaling domain of frequency and spatial variables to the lowest-order dephasing
rate or contribution of higher order in U is larger. Our preliminary analysis
indicate that this does not happen (apart from possible logarithmic corrections
to scaling) for critical points with relatively small anomalous exponents, like
Anderson transition in 2 + ǫ dimensions and quantum Hall transition which
are in the focus of this paper. It is a challenging task to understand whether
such exotic contributions may dominate the dephasing rate at transitions with
strong fluctuations, like Anderson transition in higher dimensionalities. The
complexity of the problem is related to the fact that the other contributions
are controlled by wave function correlations characterized by different scaling
exponents. We postpone this analysis to future work.

5 Coulomb interaction and experiment

Most of this paper is devoted to the case of short-range interaction, when the
interaction irrelevant in the RG sense and the dephasing rate is controlled
by critical properties at the non-interacting fixed point. In this section we
briefly discuss the present understanding of the case of long-range Coulomb

21

interaction and summarize the available experimental results.

5.1 Criticality at Anderson and quantum Hall transitions with Coulomb in-

teraction

For long-range (1/r) Coulomb interaction, the dephasing rate is proportional
to temperature, 1/τφ ∼ T . It is easy to see how the short-range interaction re-
sults develop into this behavior with decreasing λ. Indeed, the lowest possible
"short-range" λ is λ = d, for which the first line of Eq. (21) should be used,
yielding 1/τφ ∼ T . Further decreasing λ does not change the scaling of the
dephasing rate anymore, since 1/τφ cannot vanish slower than temperature in
a system with meaningfully defined fermionic excitations. The result 1/τφ ∼ T
implies that the scaling with temperature is the same as with frequency, which
is usually the case at "standard" quantum phase transitions. Therefore, in con-
trast to the case of short-range interaction, for the long-range interaction there
is no need in distinguishing the dynamical exponents governing the frequency
and temperature scaling, zT = z.

On the other hand, the long-range interaction problem is characterized by
several dynamical exponents controlling the frequency scaling of different ob-
servables [3,4]. The reason for this complex behavior is the existence of several
conserved quantities. Let us assume for simplicity that the system is spin-
polarized (or else, the spin invariance is completely broken, e.g., by spin-orbit
interaction or by magnetic impurities). Then the conserved quantities are par-
ticle number and energy. As a consequence, there are two Goldstone modes,
which are characterized by poles of the diffusion type but with a non-trivial
scaling, qzi ∼ ω. In notations of Ref. [4] z1 corresponds to the energy mode,
and z3 to the density mode.

The exponent z1, which was denoted as ζ by Finkelstein [3] and as 2 + γ∗ in
Ref. [39], governs the renormalization of frequency in the σ-model action. It is
this exponent that plays a role of zT = z for the problem we are considering,
i.e., it controls the scaling of the dephasing length Lφ ∼ τ 1/z
and therefore
enters the formula

φ

for the exponent κ of the transition width.

κ = 1/νz ;

z ≡ z1

(65)

We emphasize the distinction between different dynamical exponents, since
this was not always appreciated by researchers in the field and has led to con-
fusions and controversies. A number of authors used the exponent z3, which
is equal to 1 for the case of 1/r interaction, instead of z1 in Eq. (65). This is
incorrect. To make this point clear, it is constructive to draw an analogy with
a 2D problem: the critical problem in 2 + ǫ dimensions with small ǫ bears a

22

lot of similarities with a 2D problem with large conductance. The exponent
z3 = 1 exists also in 2D: it controls the plasmon pole in the (reducible) density
response function. It is well known, however, that the plasmon pole does not
affect the conductivity; in particular, the dephasing rate is recalculated in de-
phasing length according to a diffusion formula Lφ ∝ (Dτφ)1/2, corresponding
to z = 2. Furthermore, the localization effects are controlled by cooperons
and by "delayed diffusons" [37,38] that are given by ladder diagramms with-
out interaction vertex corrections. These are just modes that acquire the z1
dynamical scaling at criticality.

In 2 + ǫ dimensions for the considered symmetry class (time reversal and spin
symmetries are broken; denoted as "MI(LR)" in Ref. [4] ), the β-function, the
critical point, and the exponents ν and z are known up to the two-loop order

For the quantum Hall transition with Coulomb interaction not much can be
said concerning the values of the exponents on the theoretical level. Since the
transition happens in the strong-coupling regime of the σ-model, no reliable
analytical predictions can be made. The numerical analysis is also very diffi-
cult: (i) exact diagonalization can be performed for small systems only, which
is not suffucient for determining the critical behavior, and (ii) no approxi-
mate method that would allow to get the interacting critical exponents has
been developed. On general grounds, and using the analogy with the Anderson
transition in 2 + ǫ dimensions, one can say that there is no reasons to expect
that the exponents ν and z (as well as any other exponents) would take the
same values as for the non-interacting system. Also, there is no reasons for
the exponent z ≡ z1 to take any "simple" value (like, e.g., 1 or 2).

5.2 Experiments on localization transition in interacting systems

5.2.1 Anderson transition in 3D

The 3D localization transition was extensively studied on doped semiconduc-
tor systems, such as Si:P, Si:B, Si:As, Ge:Sb. In most of the works, samples
with a substantial degree of compensation [i.e. acceptors in addition to donors,
e.g. Si:(P,B)] were used, which allows one to vary the amount of disorder and
the electron concentration independently. On these samples, values of the con-
ductivity exponent s in the vicinity of s ≈ 1 were reported [40] with scattering
of values and the uncertainties of the order of 10%. A similar result was ob-
tained for an amorphous material NbxSi1−x. We recall that s is expected to
be equal in 3D to the localization length exponent ν according to the scaling
relation s = ν(d − 2).
On the other hand, the early study of the transition in undoped Si:P [41]
gave an essentially different result, s ≈ 0.5, which is also in conflict with the
Harris inequality ν > 2/d. This discrepancy was resolved in [42] where it was
found that the actual critical region in an uncompensated Si:P is rather narrow
and that the scaling analysis restricted to this range yields s ≈ 1.3. A more
recent study along these lines [16] yielded s = 1.0± 0.1, in agreement with the
values obtained for samples with compensation. It thus appears that for the
orthogonal symmetry class (preserved time-reversal and spin invariances) the
experiments have converged to the value s = 1.0 ± 0.1. (The only exception
is a recent experiment on uncompensated Si:B [17] where a larger value was
found, s ≈ 1.6. A possible explanation is that the temperatures reached in
this work were not sufficiently low. Another possibility is that Si:B belongs to
a different universality class, in view of stronger spin-orbit scattering.) Results
on the dynamical scaling are much scarcer: it was found to be z = 2.94 ± 0.3
in Ref. [16] and z ≈ 2 in Ref. [17].
The fact that the experimental value s ≈ 1 differs from the result s = ν ≃
1.57 ± 0.02 [43] for non-interacting systems of the orthogonal symmetry class
is in line with the general expectation that the Coulomb interaction affects
the critical exponents.

5.2.2 Quantum Hall transition

Experiments on the integer quantum Hall plateau transition determine the
width of the critical region (peak in σxx and plateau transition in σxy), which
scales with the temperature T as ∆B∝T κ. The early measurements of the
exponent κ performed on InGaAs/InP samples yielded κ=0.42±0.04 [14]. A
number of works discussed the effect of macroscopic inhomogeneities [46,47,15]
that complicate observation of the true IQH critical behavior. The final con-

24

clusion is [15] that for short-range disorder, when the true IQH criticality can
be achieved, κ=0.42±0.01, in agreement with the result of Ref. [14]. A very
recent work [48] where the quantum Hall transition in AlGaAs/AlGaAs sam-
ples was analyzed down to very low temperatures (1 mK) confirmed this result
for κ.

Experimental determination of the exponents ν and zT is a highly complicated
problem. The values reported in the literature are ν ≃ 2.3 [44,45] and zT ≃ 1
[48], with the scattering of data of the order of 10%. Our feeling, however, is
that these data might be essentially affected by systematic errors. Specifically,
the works [44,45] where ν was measured reported the values of κ in the range
from 0.6 to 0.8 (i.e. much larger than the true exponent 0.42). It is understood
now that such increased values of κ correspond to situations where macroscopic
inhomogeneities do not allow one to observe the true quantum Hall criticality.
In such a situation the observed ν may also differ from the actual quantum
Hall value. Further, the most direct determination of z [48] was based on the
analysis of the data for different system sizes, which is a nice way to find
the dephasing length. However, there may be a problem [49] related to the
fact that disorder strength was apparently correlated with the sample width
(see Fig.3a of Ref. [48]). As a result, the natural temperature scale (mean
free time) for different samples is different. This is not a small effect: as is
seen from Fig.3a of Ref. [48] changing the sample width by factor of 5 not
only changes the saturation temperature by factor of ≈ 5 but simultaneously
changes the characteristic temperature scale by factor of ≈ 2.5. In our view,
this might considerably affect the determination of the dynamical exponent
zT . It seems that more experimental work may be needed to overcome these
difficulties related to systematic errors in evaluation of zT and ν.

Summarizing the experimental findings, the most updated values of the expo-
nents are ν = 2.3±0.1, κ=0.42±0.01, and zT ≡ z ≃ 1.0 ± 0.1, although the
error in determination of ν and zT may be considerably underestimated due
to systematic errors. Let us remind the reader that the theoretical results for
the case of short-range interaction are as follows: the value of ν ranges from
2.35 to 2.59, zT ≃ 1.23, and κ = 1/νzT is in the range from 0.314 to 0.346.
It appears that the difference in values of the exponents between the cases of
short-range (theory) and long-range (experiment) interactions is not so large:
. 10% for ν, . 20% for zT , and . 30% for κ. (Again, for ν and zT might be
large due to systematic errors.) Nevertheless, the difference demonstrates that
the current experiments on criticality at quantum Hall transitions cannot be
explained in terms of the non-interacting fixed point. An experimental real-
ization of the short-range interaction universality class remains a challenging
issue for future research.

6 Conclusions

To summarize, we have studied the scaling properties of dephasing rate at crit-
ical point of the localization transition. We have considered the case of a short-
range interaction in systems with no spin degeneracy (or broken spin-rotation
symmetry). In this situation the interaction is found to be RG-irrelevant, and
the critical properties can be studied by performing the scaling analysis near
the non-interacting fixing point.

More specifically, we considered problems with broken time-reversal invari-
ance: the quantum Hall transition and the Anderson transition in 2 + ǫ dimen-
sions. Our work combined analytical and numerical analysis. In the analytical
part, we used the framework of the non-linear σ model. We identified oper-
ators controlling the scaling of the correlation function that determines the
dephasing rate. Further, we performed their RG analysis in 2 + ǫ dimensions.
This allowed us to find the analytical results for the exponents p, zT , and κ
governing the temperature scaling of the dephasing rate, dephasing length,
and the transition width.

The numerical analysis was used to obtain critical exponent at the quantum
Hall transition. Our results for the exponents largely agree with those obtained
in Refs. [18,19]. However, our system sizes are much largely than those studied
in Ref. [18] that was crucial for getting a window of distances where corrections
to power-law scaling are small.

Experimental results on localization transition with short-range interaction
are extremely desirable. In the case of quantum Hall transition one could
imagine screening of the Coulomb interaction by an external gate. It would be
extremely interesting to observe the change of the exponents compared to the
case of long-range interaction. This is a challenging task, especially since the
difference between the exponents appears to be not so large (see Sec. 5.2.2).
For 3D Anderson transition, its experimental realization and investigation in
cold-atoms systems would be of great importance.

On the theoretical side, the wave function correlation exponents µ2 and α need
to be evaluated for 3D Anderson transition (with and without time-reversal
invariance), in order to predict the behavior of the dephasing rate and thus the
exponents p, zT , and κ. More generally, investigation of the statistics of wave
functions at criticality beyond the leading multifractal behavior represents an
important research field. It would be interesting to understand the evolution of
this statistics (which includes the statistics of Hartree-Fock matrix elements)
from the regime of weak to strong multifractality, as it has been done for the
spectrum of leading multifractal exponents ∆q [1].

A Correlation function K1.

In this Appendix we demonstrate that the function K1 corresponds to the
eigenoperator P1,1. The function K1 can be expressed in terms of the exact
single-particle Green's functions GR,A(r, r′):

K1 =

∆2

π2 *Im GR

E(r1, r2)+.

E+ω(r1, r1) Im GR

E(r2, r2) − Im GR

E+ω(r2, r1) Im GR

Following standard steps (see e.g. Ref. [25]), we obtain

K1 =

∆2
(2πγ)2 htr ΛQaa(r1) tr ΛQbb(r2) + tr ΛQab(r1)ΛQba(r2)i ,

(A.1)

(A.2)

where repica indices a, b are different, a 6= b, which reflects the fact that we
are dealing with two different eigenstates. Since we are interested in the case
for which two points are close to each other (say, r1 − r2 is of order of a few
lattice constants a), we can consider the arguments of Q matrices as equal.
Below the arguments are omitted.

Let us define two operators bilinear in Q:

O±[Q] = tr ΛQabΛQba ± tr ΛQab tr ΛQba.

(A.3)

Clearly, K1 ∝ O+. In order to obtain the U(n)× U(n) invariant expression let
us perform the following global rotation in the Q-matrix space,

which does not change the action Sσ. Thus, we introduce the averaged, oper-
ators

O±[Q] = Dtr Λ[U−1QU]abΛ[U−1QU]ba ± tr Λ[U−1QU]ab tr Λ[U−1QU]baEU
(A.5)
where h. . .iU denotes averaging over U(n) × U(n) global rotations. Since the
action Sσ is invariant under U(n) × U(n), the σ-model averages of O±[Q] and
O±[Q] are equal,

h O±[Q]i = hO±[Q]i,

(A.6)

In order to perform the averaging over U(n) × U(n) rotations, we use the
following results [50]:

where V1, V1,1 and V2 are given in Table A.1. The index p = ± distinguishes
between the retarded and advanced sectors, i.e. (U +, U−) is an element of
U(n) × U(n). The averaging over U + and U− is carried out independently.
Performing the averaging, we obtain the following U(n) × U(n) invariant re-
sults:

O±[Q] =

(A.9)

It is not difficult to check that operators O± are eigenoperators under the
action of the renormalization group: O− = P2 and O+ = P1,1 .

B Correlation function K2.

In this Appendix, we express the correlation function K2 in terms of basis
operators Oj[Q]. This requires, in addition to bilinear operators considered in
Appendix A, introducing operators of the fourth order in Q. As in the previous
Appendix, it is convenient to perform global transformation (A.4) and average
over U(n) × U(n) rotations. Then K2 becomes

K2 =

∆4

(2πγ)4(cid:28)R1[Q] + R2[Q](cid:29)

(B.1)

where

R1[Q] = htr Λ(U−1QU)abΛ(U−1QU)ba tr Λ(U−1QU)cdΛ(U−1QU)dciU ,
R2[Q] = htr Λ(U−1QU)abΛ(U−1QU)bcΛ(U−1QU)cdΛ(U−1QU)daiU ..

(B.2)
(B.3)

In order to perform averaging over U(n) × U(n) rotations it is convenient to
use diagrammatic technique developed in Ref. [51]. The result is as follows

R1[Q] = Xp=±(cid:26)V2,2(Tr Qp)4 + (4V4 + 2V2,1,1) Tr Q2
