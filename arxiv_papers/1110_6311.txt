Macroscopic quantum tunneling of the phase is a fundamental phenomenon in the quantum dy-
namics of superconducting nanocircuits. The tunneling rate can be controlled in such circuits, where
the potential landscape for the phase can be tuned with different external bias parameters. Precise
theoretical knowledge of the macroscopic quantum tunneling rate is required in order to simulate
and understand the experiments. We present a derivation, based on the instanton technique, of an
analytical expression of the escape rate in general quartic and symmetric sextic potentials compris-
ing two escape paths. These new potentials were recently realized when creating a noise-insensitive
phase qubit in the camel-back potential of a dc SQUID.

INTRODUCTION

Due to the enormous progress in nanotechnology, su-
perconducting nanocircuits are nowadays commonly ma-
nipulated in the quantum regime1,2. The collective be-
havior of superconducting electrons on the macroscopic
scale is described with the superconducting phase of the
Cooper pair condensate. As a function of this collective
degree of freedom, the relevant potential energy for the
phase is composed of minima separated by potential bar-
riers. At sufficiently low temperatures, the quantization
of energy in the potential wells generates quantum states
that can be used in quantum information processing. The
quantum dynamics as well as the readout of the quantum
state are then governed by the tunneling between differ-
ent minima of the potential. It is thus crucial to know the
appropriate macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) rate
of the phase for an arbitrary potential shape. Although
this quantity can be calculated numerically in a general
one- or multi-dimensional potential, it is much more con-
venient to have an analytical solution when possible. In
the following, we show that for a general quartic poten-
tial and a symmetric sextic potential it is still possible
to derive an analytical solution for the MQT rate. We
will take a phase qubit as a physical example3, but our
results apply to any system presenting such potentials.

Usually, the precise shape of the potential depends on
certain bias parameters. Most of the experiments on su-
perconducting circuits are performed with current-biased
Josephson junctions. The relevant potential for the phase
is then the so-called tilted washboard potential4. If the
bias current is close to the critical current, the wash-
board potential is well approximated by a cubic poly-
nomial with a local potential minimum from which the
phase can escape into a continuum by tunneling. How-
ever, interesting features appear away from this working
point. In case of a SQUID loop for instance, at small cur-
rent bias and with a flux bias close to half a flux quantum,
the quantum states become weakly sensitive to current

noise. In this region, the relevant potential has a quartic
contribution and presents two escape points. This work-
ing point was used in the experiment of Ref. 5, where a
phase qubit was created in the so-called camel-back po-
tential of a dc SQUID. For this experiment, the results of
the present paper can be used for simulations and data
processing6.

In this paper we derive the expression of the MQT
rate in a general quartic potential from which tunneling
occurs through two possible escape paths, as depicted
in Fig. 2. We use the instanton formalism developed in
Ref. 7. We also give the MQT rate for a symmetric sex-
tic potential. The analytical expression is Eq. (31) and
the total escape rate turns out to be the sum of the es-
cape rates for tunneling through each barrier. We find a
simple result in the case of the experimentally relevant
camel-back potential, Eq. (35), depending on the bottom
well frequency and the barrier height. We finally discuss
the detailed shape of the potential in terms of the experi-
mental parameters of the phase qubit in the two limiting
cases of the washboard and the camel-back potential in
Appendix A.

II. QUARTIC POTENTIAL IN A SQUID

The SQUID is a superconducting loop interrupted by
two Josephson junctions8, see Fig. 1.a. The Josephson
junctions are characterized by their critical currents Ic1,2
or equivalently their Josephson energies EJ1,2 = 
2e Ic1,2 ,
their capacitances C1,2, and the phase differences ϕ1,2
across them. Each arm of the loop has a self-inductance
L1,2 and carries a partial current I1,2. The SQUID is
biased by the current bias Ib = I1 + I2 and the flux bias
Φb. We introduce the reduced variables x = 1
2 (ϕ1 + ϕ2)
and y = 1
In the following we consider a
SQUID for which the capacitances in each arm are al-
most equal, C1 ≃ C2. The Hamiltonian in the (x, y)
plane reads H = 1

and Qy are the charges conjugate to the phases x and
y, C−1 = C−1
is the total inverse capacitance,
EJ = EJ1 + EJ2 is the total Josephson energy. The char-
acteristic frequency of the phase dynamics is the plasma
frequency ωp = √8EJ EC /, where EC = e2/2C is the
charging energy of the SQUID. Due to the symmetry in
the capacitances there is no coupling between the charges
Qx and Qy. We define the reduced biases s = Ib/Ic,
yb = Φb/2φ0 with the reduced flux quantum φ0 = /2e,
the critical current asymmetry α = (Ic2 − Ic1 )/Ic, the
loop inductance asymmetry η = (L2 − L1)/L, and the
junction-to-loop inductance ratio b = 2φ0/LIc, where
Ic = Ic1 + Ic2 is the total critical current and L = L1 + L2
is the total inductance. The reduced potential then reads

u(x, y) = − cos x cos y−α sin x sin y−sx−sηy+b(y−yB)2.
(1)
The dynamics is then equivalent to a fictitious particle
of mass M = φ2
0C and coordinates (x, y) moving in the
potential u(x, y).

The typical shape of the potential u(x, y), Eq. (1), is
composed of local minima and saddle points connected by
narrow valleys (see Fig. 1.b). The presence of extremal
points is governed by the bias fields. Indeed, if s is larger
than unity for example, there are no minima. For a given
value of the flux, we define the critical current as the value
sc at which the minima merge with the saddle points,
consequently there are neither minima nor saddle points
for bias currents s larger than sc. The diagram sc(yB) is
called the critical diagram.

To study the phase dynamics from minimum to mini-
mum in this potential, we will suppose that the fictitious

2

particle follows the path of minimal curvature. We can
then describe the dynamics with one variable, since the
path in the plane (x, y) is determined by x and y = ζ(x)
(see Fig. 1.b). We call z(x) the curvilinear abscissa along
the path of minimum curvature, defined by

z(x) = z0 +Z x

x0

dx′p1 + ζ′2(x′).

(3)

It is now tempting to consider the motion according to
the effective one-dimensional potential EJ u(z).
In the
following we check that the perpendicular dynamics does
not generate additional terms.

Let us consider a point (x, y) at abscissa z on this path
and call θ the angle between the x axis and the direction
of minimal curvature (θ ∈ [−π, π])

The direction of minimal curvature is denoted by X// and
the perpendicular direction, given by the angle θ + π/2,
is denoted by X⊥. We can then express the Hamiltonian
in terms of X//, X⊥, P// = M X//, and P⊥ = M X⊥ by
performing a rotation of angle θ.
In the transverse direction,
the frequency ω⊥ =
q∂2
X⊥ u(x, y) ωp is much larger than the bottom well
frequency ω0 in the direction of minimum curvature
(ω⊥/ω0 ≃ 7 in the experiment of Ref. 5). The per-
pendicular dynamics is thus much faster than the dy-
namics along the path of minimum curvature, and can
be averaged out. The dynamics in the longitudinal di-
rection is then governed by the effective Hamiltonian
H// = hHi⊥ obtained after averaging H over the trans-
verse degree of freedom, the kinetic part being obtained
using P 2
. To proceed, we consider an
adiabatic evolution in the longitudinal direction and use
X// as a fixed parameter. We suppose the perpendicu-
lar dynamics frozen in the ground state of an effective
potential of bottom well frequency ω⊥. The effective
perpendicular dynamics, obtained within the harmonic
approximation, is governed by the Hamiltonian

where the parameter X0 originates from the slope of
the potential
in the transverse direction. Averaging
over the motion in the transverse direction gives rise
to two contributions to the potential of H//: hH⊥i⊥ =
ω⊥ − 1
0 . In practice, however, this additional
potential hH⊥i⊥/EJ is only a small correction to u(z)
(see Fig. 1.c) and will be neglected in the following. The
quantum dynamics of the phase can thus be treated in
the one-dimensional potential U(z) = EJ u(z) following
the path of minimum curvature.
To quantify the adiabaticity, we evaluate the over-
lap of the transverse ground-state wave functions at two
points z1 and z2 along the path of minimal curvature. It

We choose the origin of the curvilinear abscissa along
the path of minimum curvature at a particular minimum
MinC with coordinates (xm, ym). Along the path of min-
imum curvature (x, ζ(x)), this minimum is connected to
two saddle points SaddleL,R, which are both connected
to another minimum MinL,R. The shape of the barriers
is given by the one-dimensional potential U(z). The con-
vention is to call MinR the peripheral minimum with the
lowest potential energy and to orient z towards MinR. If
we focus on the dynamics around the minimum, this po-
tential is well approximated by its Taylor expansion up
to fourth order, i.e. U(z) = U(0) + U (z) + O(z5) with

where the bottom well frequency ω0 ∼ ωp and the co-
efficients u3 ≥ 0, u4 ≥ 0 are obtained numerically or
with approximate expressions in specific cases (see Ap-
pendix A). The abscissa qL,R = z(SaddleL,R) of the sad-
dle points are

qL,R =(cid:16) − 3u3 ∓q9u2

The point at σR is always defined whereas σL has a phys-
ical meaning only when U (MinL) ≤ U (MinC). When
the coefficient u4 is larger than u3, the potential is com-
posed of two barriers. Because of these two "humps" (see
Fig. 2), this potential has been called the camel-back po-
tential5.

The dynamics in a given minimum is governed by the

where Z = pM ω0/ z is the reduced position opera-
u3p/M ω0/2, and b = u4/2M ω0. Due to the presence

of the terms proportional to a and b, Hamiltonian (8)
describes an anharmonic oscillator. At sufficiently low
temperatures below the plasma frequency, the energy
spectrum of the particle is quantized in the minimum.
Assuming the anharmonicity to be weak, a second or-
der perturbation theory in a and b leads to a transition
frequency between the levels n and n − 1

(9)

where Λn is the anharmonicity of the oscillator

Λn = 3b + 15

4 a2 + 3

4 b2(17n + 7/n).

(10)

The anharmonicity depends on the working point
(Ib, Φb). A sufficiently large anharmonicity is necessary
to reach the two-level limit. Indeed, the manipulation of
the states is performed with a microwave in resonance
with the energy difference between the ground state and
the first excited state and for a harmonic oscillator, where
the anharmonicity vanishes, this microwave would excite
all the levels. For a sufficiently large Λ, the two states 0i
and 1i are decoupled from the others and constitute a
qubit. The confining potential depending on the phases,
this two level system is called a phase qubit9 -- 12.

To understand the quantum dynamics of the phase
qubit in the camel-back potential, comprising two bar-
riers, it is necessary to calculate the tunneling rate in a
general quartic potential Eq. (5). We present the deriva-
tion of the escape rate in the following section using the
instanton technique. We also extend the result in the case
of a sextic contribution when the potential is symmetric.

III. DERIVATION OF THE MACROSCOPIC

QUANTUM TUNNELING RATE

The expression of the escape rate in the quartic po-
tential sketched in Fig. 2, with a double escape path, is
not explicitly given in the literature of MQT (see e.g.

Refs. 13 -- 15) and has to be calculated. We use the in-
stanton technique7,16 to derive the escape rate from the
metastable state of the quartic potential Eq. (5).

The escape rate Γ is obtained from the quantum
ground state of the fictitious particle confined in the well.
Indeed, if E0 is the ground state energy, the norm of the
particle wave function Ψ(z, t) in the well follows the tem-
poral evolution

Z dz Ψ(z, t)2 = e2Im E0t/,

which decays exponentially with the decay rate

Γ = −



Im E0.

(11)

(12)

The existence of a non-zero imaginary part comes from
the possibility to tunnel out of the trap. The life-
time of the state is equal to Γ−1. The quantum dy-
namics of the particle is governed by the Hamiltonian
2M P 2 + U (z) where the potential U (z) comprises
H = 1
a local but not global minimum, fixed at z = 0 for con-
venience. If we were dealing with a classical particle, the
equilibrium state would be the particle at rest at the local
minimum. This is however not possible in the presence of
quantum fluctuations. Moreover, quantum mechanically,
the extension of the wave function allows the particle to
evolve out of the trap where the potential energy is lower.
The classical equilibrium is thus a "false ground state"16.
The energy of the particle in the well is calculated from
the propagator

(13)

G(t) = h0e−iHt/0i = e−iE0t/,
where 0i is the position eigenstate at z = 0.
The probability amplitude Eq. (13) is obtained after
integrating over all possible trajectories z(t) satisfying
the boundary conditions z(ti) = z(tf ) = 0. For a given
path, the phase of the contribution is the corresponding
action in units of the action quantum 17. To proceed,
let us perform first a Wick rotation: time t is replace by
the imaginary time τ = it. Then the action for a fixed
trajectory becomes the Euclidean action

S(z) =Z T /2

−T /2

dτ(cid:20) M

2

z2 + U (z)(cid:21) ,

(14)

where the dot means time derivative with respect to τ
and iti,f = ∓T /2. The effect of the Wick rotation on the
action is thus to invert the potential (see Fig. 2, inset).
In other words, in the part of space between the mini-
mum and the exit point, the momentum of the particle
is imaginary: P 2 = −2M U (z) < 0. But if we choose the
time variable t as an imaginary variable τ = it, then the
motion is possible in the sense of classical dynamics in
the inverted potential −U (z). In terms of path integrals
the propagator reads

G(T ) = N Z z(+T /2)=0

z(−T /2)=0 Dz e−S(z)/.

(15)

The parameter N is a normalization factor and Dz de-
notes the integration over all functions z(t) obeying the
boundary conditions. The propagator (15) can be evalu-
ated in the semiclassical limit, where the functional inte-
gral is dominated by the stationary point ¯z of S(z). The
stationary point satisfies δS(z)/δz¯z = 0, i.e.,

The prefactor N is determined using the Gelfand-Yaglom
formula, establishing that the ratio of two determinants

ent potentials is equal to the ratio of the corresponding
wave functions. Using the asymptotic expression of the
wave function of a harmonic oscillator of mass M and

Let us specify the shape of the trajectory ¯z(τ ), solution
of Eq. (16), to determine the action S0 and the function
K(T ). We consider the nontrivial solutions where the
particle can start at the top of the hill in the inverted
potential, bounces off the potential on the right at z =
σR or on the left at z = σL and returns to the top of
the hill. For T → ∞, we call this trajectory the right,
and respectively the left, "bounce"7. The bounce has an

During the time T , several bounces occur, and the to-

consist of nR right bounces and nL left bounces with cen-
ters spread between −T /2 and T /2. We use the dilute

sidered to be independent, which is valid when the time
between two successive attempts is larger than the tun-
neling time. The action of a multibounce is nLSL

As a conclusion, in the limit of a dilute gas of instantons,
the total escape rate is simply the sum of the tunneling
rates for each barrier. This simple result is a direct con-
sequence of the dilute instanton gas approximation since
interference effects between successive tunneling events
would change the tunneling rate in one barrier and the
resulting rate for two escape paths.

As a result, the tunneling rate of a particle of mass

Eqs. (26) and (31) constitute the central result of our
work. The MQT rate is plotted in Fig. 3 for a potential
varying from a cubic to a purely quartic profile. Start-
ing from a purely cubic potential, the tunneling rate de-
creases as the barrier height increases. When the tunnel-
ing rates of both barriers are non-vanishing, the total tun-
neling rate is enhanced and reaches another maximum for
the purely quartic potential. This value of the tunneling

In the case of the camel-back potential (u3 = 0), we

get the tunneling rate

bottom well frequency ω0/2π and the mass parameter is fixed

rate is also obtained for a quartic potential when the cu-
bic and quartic contributions are similar (u3 ≃ u4 ≃ 0.5).
When the potential is symmetric and has a sextic con-
tribution, U (z) = 1
0z2(1 − u4z2 − u6z4), the ficti-
tious particle can use two paths to escape at the exit
points ±σs with the same MQT rate Γss/2. The exit
points are defined with σs = q(pu2
4 + 4u6 − u4)/2u6
and the sextic coefficient satisfies u6 > −u2
4/4 (u4 > 0).
At u6 = −u2
4/4, the three minima are at the same height
and a macroscopic quantum coherence develops between
them. The possibility to tunnel between them lifts the
degeneracy and the spectrum becomes composed of three
hybridized levels separated by an energy given by the
tunneling strength. Our general results can be applied
to this symmetric sextic potential as well and leads to

In Appendix A we show that the camel-back potential
is in fact better fitted with a sextic contribution. The
resulting MQT rate is presented in Fig. 4. The sextic
contribution mainly sharpens the camel-back potential
and hence increases the tunneling rate.

The tunneling rate of the ground state can be used to

calculate the tunneling rate for the excited states18.

As seen in Sec. II, these two regimes can be observed
in a phase qubit close to the critical line and around
the working point biased with a weak current and half
a flux quantum, respectively. The bounce orbits as well
as the MQT rates are plotted in Fig. 5. The tunneling
time turns out to be of the order of the period of oscil-
lation T0 = 2πω−1
0 . The approximation of a dilute gas

of instantons is valid when the time between two tun-
neling events Γ−1 is larger than the tunneling time T0,
i.e. Γ < ω0/2π. This corresponds to a barrier height
larger than the ground state energy ω0/2. The escape
rate from the camel-back potential of parameters (ω0, V )
corresponds to the escape rate from a cubic potential of
parameters ( 2√5

V. CONCLUSION

Using the instanton technique we calculate the escape
rate from the metastable state of a quartic and a sym-
metric sextic potential, in which the fictitious particle
can tunnel through two different barrier potentials. This
work is of interest for Josephson junction based nanocir-
cuits, such as in the field of circuit quantum electro-
dynamics, where the potential shapes are designed for
an efficient quantum information processing. In particu-
lar, the results can be directly used in the case of phase
qubits, where we give the tunneling rate as a function
of the biases in two different regimes, namely close to
the critical line and also close to the working point with
a weak current bias and half a flux quantum magnetic
bias.

Appendix A: Topography of the phase qubit

In this Appendix we present the shape of the one-
dimensional potential, i.e. ω0, u3, and u4, of a phase
qubit in two different regimes, namely the washboard po-
tential and the camel-back potential. The bottom well
frequency and the barrier height can be directly used to

1. Washboard potential

Close to the critical line the one-dimensional potential
has a washboard shape. We Taylor expand the potential
in x, y and s at third order around xc, yc, and sc in
the direction of vanishing curvature, given by the angle
tan θc = −∂2
xyu(xc, yc). The potential can
be expressed in terms of the barrier height V and the
bottom well frequency ω0 as follows

We focus on the domain of bias fields around the
