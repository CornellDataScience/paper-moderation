Abstract 
         Based  on  the  BTK  theory,  we  investigate  the  tunneling  conductance  in 
uniaxially  strained  graphene-based  normal  metal  (NG)/  barrier  (I)/superconductor 
(SG)  junctions.  In  the  present model,  we  assume  that  by  depositing  the  conventional 
superconductor  on  the  top  of  the  uniaxially  strained  graphene,  normal  graphene  may 
turn  to  superconducting  graphene  with  the  Cooper  pairs  formed  by  the  asymmetric 
Weyl-Dirac  electrons,  the  massless  fermions  with  direction-dependent  velocity.  The 
highly  asymmetrical  velocity,  vy/vx>>1,  may  be  created  by  strain  in  the  zigzag 
direction  near  the  transition  point  between  gapless  and  gapped  graphene.  In  the  case 
of highly asymmetrical velocity, we find  that  the Andreev reflection strongly depends 
on  the  direction  and  the  current  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  strain  can  flow 
through  the  junction  as  if  there  was  no  barrier.  Also,  the  current  parallel  to  the 
direction  of  strain  anomalously  oscillates  as  a  function  of  the  gate  voltage  with  very 
high  frequency.  Our  predicted  result  is  quite  different  from  the  feature  of  the 
quasiparticle  tunneling  in  the  unstrained  graphene-based  NG/I/SG  conventional 
junction.  This  is  because  of  the  presence  of  the  direction-dependent-velocity 
quasiparticles in the highly strained graphene system.

1. 
Introduction 
         Since  graphene,  a  one-atomic-thick  monolayer  of  graphite,  has  been  first 
fabricated  [1],  it  has  become  a  new  material  with  great  potential  for  novel  devices. 
Because  of  honeycomb-like  lattice,  electrons  in  grapheme  mimic  the  massless 
relativistic Weyl –Dirac  particles, with  the  Fermi  v elocity  vF  ~  106 m/s  playing  a  role 
of the speed of light [2-4]. The energy spectrum E(k) of electrons in graphene exhibits

relativistic  fermions,  graphene  leads  condensed  matter  into  the  world  of  quantum 
electrodynamics.  In  contrast  to  the  Schrödinger-lik e  electrons,  massless  relativistic 
electrons  in  graphene  tunnel  through  a  barrier  without  back  reflection  at  the  normal 
incidence, known as Klein paradox [5].  
         Specular  Andreev  reflection  in  graphene  is  one  of  the  interesting  effects 
appearing  in  graphene  as  a  bridge  between  relativity  and  superconductivity,  since 
graphene  can  be  a  superconductor  by  mean  of  proximity  effect  [6,  7].  Depositing 
conventional superconductor on the top of a graphene sheet leads the normal graphene 
(NG)  to  become  superconducting  graphene  or  graphene  superconductor  (SG)  [6,  7]. 
Graphene  superconductor  fabricated  by  depositing  Ti/Al  (10/70nm)  and  Pt/Ta/Pt 
(3/70/3nm)  on  the  top  of  graphene  sheet  give  rise  to  the  critical  temperature  of  1.3K 
[6]  and  2.5  K  [7],  respectively.    The  relativistic  Cooper  pairs  in  such  system  are 
r
formed  by Weyl-Dirac  electrons  with  momentum  k
  and  spin  up  attracting  to Weyl-
r
−   and  spin  down.  The  tunneling  between  normal 
Dirac  electrons  with  momentum  k
graphene  and  superconducting  graphene,  a  NG/SG  junction,  was  first  studied  by 
Beenakker [8]. The combination between relativity and superconductivity  leads  to  the 
specular  Andreev  reflection,  occurring  when  the  Fermi  energy  EF  of  NG  is  smaller 
than  the  biased  energy  eV.  The  conductance  drops  to  zero  at  eV=EF,  the  transition 
point between the retro and the specular Andreev reflections. Effect of the presence of 
the  specular Andreev  reflection  in NG/SG  junction  also  gives  rise  to  a  new  aspect  of 
the  tunneling  conductance which  is  quite  different  from  that  in  the  conventional N/S 
junction  [9,  10].  In  the  case  of  the  junction  having  a  gate  barrier,  NG/I/SG  junction 
[11-13],  the  conductance  of  the  junction  oscillates  as  a  function  of  the  gate  voltage, 
also in contrast to the decaying behavior in the conventional N/I/S junction [9, 10]. 
        Recently,  electronic  properties  of  the  deformed  graphene  system  have  drawn 
much  attention  [14-22].    Remarkably,  the  locally  strained  graphene  can  induce  a 
valley-dependent  pseudo-vector  potential  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  stain,  due 
to  shifted  valley-dependent  Dirac  point  in  the  strained  region  [14-17].  This  leads  to 
the  valley  polarization,  an  important  characteristic  for  valleytronics  [14-17].  Also,  a 
gigantic  pseudo  magnetic  field  greater  than  300  Tesla  resulting  from  the  strongly 
deformed  graphene  was  observed  in  graphene  nanobubbles  [18].  In  the  case  of 
graphene  being  uniaxially  strained,  gapless  graphene may  turn  to  gapped  graphene  at 
the  critical  strain  (SC)  [21-20].  Several  groups  predicted  that  energy  gap  in  graphene 
may be opened up by  applying  tension  in  the zigzag direction  [21, 22]. As  in contrast 
to the electrons in the undeformed graphene system, for strain smaller than the critical 
value  SC,  electrons  in  the  strained-graphene  exhibit  asymmetric  massless  fermions 
governed by the asymmetric energy dispersion [22]

carriers  of  the  strained  graphene  system  with  strain  smaller  than  SC  are  governed  by 
the two-dimensional asymmetric Weyl –Dirac Hamiltoni an, as is given by [22, 23]

         In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  model  to  show  the  effect  of  asymmetrical  velocity

proximity-induced  superconductor  [6,  7]  when  conventional  superconductor  is

of  direction-dependent  velocity  on  tunneling  conductance  of  the  system  with  highly

the  conductance  in  the  strongly  deformed  graphene  NG/I/SG  junction  which  are 
influenced  by  the  effect  of  the  asymmetric  Weyl –Dir ac  fermions,  instead  of  the 
symmetric Weyl –Dirac  fermions  in  the  undeformed  gra phene  NG/I/SG  conventional 
junctions  [8,  11-13].  In  our model we  use  the  strain  dependence  of  the  geometry  and 
hoping energies of grapheme, based on ref.21.

in  the  undeformed  graphene,  we  find  that  the  critical  deformation  point  is  found  at 
2=η
strain of SC ~0.228855  (
)  for  strain applying  in  the zigzag direction as  shown  in 
Fig.(1b).  In  this  numerical  result,  applying  strain  in  the  armchair  direction  gives  rise 
2<η
to  the  gapless  graphene,  due  to 
  for  all  strain.  The  effect  of  asymmetrical 
velocity  when  applying  strain 
in 
the  armchair  direction  yields  very  small

when  S → SC  which  gives  rise  to  the  highly

cause  the  highly  asymmetric  velocity  for  fermions,  in  the  next  section, we  focus  this 
effect  on  the  specular  Andreev  reflection  and  the  tunneling  conductance  in  the 
deformed graphene-based NG/I/SG junction. 
 
 2.2 Scattering process in deformed graphene-based NG/I/SG junctions 
         In  this  section,  we  investigate  the  tunneling  conductance  in  NG/I/SG  junctions 
in the case of graphene sheet being deformed. Graphene sheet is strained in the zigzag 
direction  (see  Fig.2).  We  focus  on  the  two  currents  flow  in  x-direction  (model  in 
Fig.2a) and  y-direction (model  in Fig.2b). The  junctions are biased by  the potential V 
and  the  gate  voltage  VG.  As  we  have  mentioned  above,  the  Cooper  pairs  in  the 
deformed  graphene-based  superconductor  are  assumed  as  formed  by  the  asymmetric 
r

         Let  we  first  consider  the  scattering  process  due  to  the  current  parallel  to  the 
direction of  strain  (Ix). This model  is  illustrated  in Fig.2a.  In  this case,  the parallel  (or

Result and discussion

         We  first  consider  the  angle-dependent  Andreev  probability  amplitudes

As  we  mentioned  in  the  previous  section  (see  Fig.  1b),  the  transition  point  between 
gapless  graphene  to  gapped  graphene  is  at  strain  of  SC=0.228855.  In  this  section  we 
need  value  of  strain  near  the  critical  value  SC  to  show  the  effect  of  the  highly 
asymmetric  velocity  vy>>vx  on  the  Andreev  reflection.  The  Andreev  probability

are  assumed  to  show  the  effect  of  the  specular Andreev  reflection when 
on 
the conductances. We first consider Gx for strain of S=0, 0.2, and 0.2288 (see Fig.4a). 
The  curve,  for  strain=0,  is  to  show  the  conductance  due  to  the  direction-independent 
velocity  fermions  in  the  unstrained  graphene  NG/SG  conventional  junction,  as 
predicted previously  in  refs. 11-13.  In  this direction,  increasing  strain approaching SC

leads  to  the  conductance  vanishing.  Strain
Previously obtained  in eqn.(5), we have vx(strain=0, 0.2 and 0.2288)= vF, 0.342292vF 
and  0.014824vF,  respectively. As  very  different  from Gx,  the  conductance Gy  seen  in 
Fig.4b  increases  with  increasing  strain  for  all  eV.  Remarkably,  for  strain=0.2288  a 
similar perfect current switch at eV=EF, the transition point between specular Andreev 
reflection  and  the  retro  Andreev  reflection  is  observed  in  this  junction.  This  is  very 
different  from  that  in  the  unstrained  case  (strain=0,  see  refs.11-13)  and  it  may  be 
applicable  for  nanoswicth  devices. The  strain  dependence  of  velocity  vy(strain=0,  0.2 
,and  0.2288)=  vF  ,  1.08075vF,  and  1.0928  vF,  respectively.  The  velocity  ratio 
vy/vx=73%  for  strain  =0.2288.  As  a  conclusion,  rising  velocity  ratio  vy/vx  >>1  by 
increasing strain approaching SC results in better current switch for the conductance in 
the y-direction at eV=EF.  
          We  next  consider  the  case  of  the  heavily  doped  graphene  in  the  SG

∆
region
U
  for  no  barrier  Z=0  and  the  case  of  highly-asymmetric-velocity 
particles  (vy/vx=73%  for  strain  =0.2288),  as  seen  in  Figs.5a-5b.  The  conductances  in 
NG/SG junction are calculated as a function of the biased voltage V for various values 
of EF. As  a  result,  the  behavior  of  the  conductance Gy  is  rather  different  from  that  of 
∆1.0
∆5.0
,  ∆   and 
the  conductance  Gx.  In  case  of  the  conductance  Gy,  for  small  EF=
,
∆5.1
,  the  behavior  of  conductance  is  similar  to  that  of  Gy  for  the  case  of  weakly 
∆
doped graphene (U~small). For the large Fermi energy EF~
1000 , the conductance is 
similar  to  the  case  of  the  unstrained  graphene-based NG/SG  junction  [8,  11-13],  as  is 
strain-independent.  But  in  the  case  of  Gx,  the  conductance  is  rather  small.  The 
∆
1000 .  
conductanc peak due to the Andreev resonance is found for the large EF~

         In  Figs.  6-7,  the  conductances  are  plotted  as  a  function  of  the  barrier  strength

∆100 , and 
0.2288. In Fig6a, the conductance Gy is first investigated. We set U=0, EF=
eV=0,  as  the  case  of  zero  biased  voltage  and  as  the  case  of  the  non-Fermi-energy 
mismatch in NG and SG. For strain=0, we have the same curve as that in refs.12-13 of 
the  unstrained  case.  Interestingly, when  increasing  strain  approaching  SC,  the  current 
flows  through  the  junction  with  G~2  as  if  there  was  no  barrier.  This  is  to  show  that 
when  vy/vx>>1,  the  general  effect  of  the  gate  voltage  is  destroyed  by  the  highly-
asymmetric-velocity  effect  for  Gy.  In  Fig6b,  we  take  into  account  the  effect  of  the 
∆900 .  Increasing  U  decreases  the  amplitude  of  Gy  [11-
Fermi-energy  mismatch  U=
13].  We  find  that  increasing  strain  approaching  SC  also  destroys  the  effect  of  gate 
voltage,  like  the  behavior  of  the  case  for  U~0.  Let  us  next  consider  the  conductance 
Gx  as  a  function  of  the  barrier  strength  Z,  which  is  numerically  shown  in  Fig7.  For 
∆100 ,  and  eV=0,  the  anomalous 
U=0  (case  of  non-Fermi-energy  mismatch),  EF=
conductance  oscillation  with  very  high  frequency  is  found  when  strain  is  of  0.2288 
(vy/vx=73%).  The  increasing  frequency  of  the  oscillation  in  Gx  can  be  described  via 
eqn.(12).  The  anomalous  oscillation  is  due  to  the  term  of  “exp[iZ(v F/vx)] ”.  This  is  to 
show  straightforwardly  that  the  frequency  related  to  the  term  of  “exp[iZ(v F/vx)] ”  is 
proportional  to  ~1/vx.  The  small  value  of  vx=0.014824vF  for  strain  of  0.2288  gives 
rise  to  the  high  frequency.  However,  this  anomalous  behavior,  which  is  rather 
different  from  the  case  of  the  unstrained  NG/I/SG  junction  [11-13],  is  not  observed 
∆900 ).

Summary and conclusion 
         We  have  investigated  the  conductances  in  strained  graphene-based  NG/I/SG 
junctions where  graphene  sheet  is  strained  in  the  zigzag  direction.  This work  studied 
the  conductance  based  on  the  BTK  formalism  and  based  on  the  assumption  that  by 
depositing  conventional  superconductor  on  the  top  of  the  strained  graphene  sheet, 
graphene  can  be  a  superconductor  with  the  Cooper  pairs  formed  by  the  asymmetric 
Weyl-Dirac  electrons,  instead  of  the  symmetric  Weyl-Dirac  electrons  in  the  case  of 
unstrained  graphene  system.  Strain  in  the  zigzag  direction  gives  rise  to  the  highly-
asymmetric-velocity  massless 
fermions, 
asymmetric  Weyl –Dirac 
fermions

v
, as  the carriers of  the  system when  strain approaches  the critical point, 
with

y
the  point  of  the  transition  between  gapless  and  gapped  graphene  [21-22].  In  our 
model,  we  used  the  geometrically  deformed  graphene  based  on  the  model  of  ref.21, 
leading  to  the  critical  strain  SC~0.228855.  In  this  work,  we  focused  on  the  effect  of 
strain  near  the  SC  which  causes  the  strong  effect  of  the  highly-asymmetric-velocity 
fermions  on  the  Andreev  reflection  and  the  conductances  of  the  junctions.  The 
currents  were  investigated  for  the  two  cases  which  are  parallel  and  perpendicular  to 
the  direction  of  strain.  As  a  result,  because  we  have  taken  into  account  the  effect  of 
v ≠
v
  resulting  from  strain  on  the  superconducting  transport 
asymmetric  velocity

property,  we  found  a  novel  feature  of  the  Andreev  reflection  and  the  tunneling 
conductance  which  have  not  been  predicted  in  the  previously  unstrained  graphene-
based  NG/I/SG  junctions  [8,  11-13].  All  of  our  theoretically  predicted  results  should 
be experimentally testable.

,  respectively and  (b)  the velocity  ratio vy/vx  for graphene  sheet being  strained 
and 
in  the  zigzag  or  x  direction  and  the  armchair  or  y  direction.  The  highly  asymmetric 
velocity  is  found  only  the  case  where  graphene  is  strained  in  the  zigzag  direction, 
vy/vx ∞→  for strain →  SC. 
 
Figure  2  shows  the  present  models  of  strained  graphene-based  NG/I/SG  junctions 
where  graphene  is  strained  in  the  zigzag  direction  for  (a)  the  case  of  current  Ix 
parallel  to  the  direction  of  strain  and  (b)  the  case  of  current  Iy  perpendicular  to  the 
direction  of  strain.  The  two  junctions  are  biased  by  the  voltage  V  and  the  gate 
potential  applied  in  the  barrier  is  denoted  as VG.  The  injected  angle  of  quasiparticles 
at the interface of the NG/I/SG junction is denoted as θ .

current in the x-direction.
