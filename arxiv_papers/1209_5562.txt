We propose an alternative platform to observe Majorana bound states in solid state systems. High
critical temperature cuprate superconductors can induce superconductivity, by proximity effect, in
quasi one dimensional nanowires with strong spin orbit coupling. They favor a wider and more
robust range of conditions to stabilize Majorana fermions due to the large gap values, and offer
novel functionalities in the design of the experiments determined by different dispersion for Andreev
bound states as a function of the phase difference.

Recently there is an increasing interest in topological
quantum computation based on Majorana Bound States
(MBS's) [1, 2]. Majorana Fermions have been predicted
in a wide class of low-dimensional solid state devices.
Many of these proposals make use of quasi one dimen-
sional superconductors in contact with topological insu-
lators [3] or quasi one-dimensional materials with strong
spin orbit interactions [4 -- 7]. Also helical magnets [8]
and other materials [9 -- 13] are considered.
In this pa-
per we propose a quite distinctive heterostructure to ob-
serve topologically protected MBS's in a solid state de-
vice. Our work rests on the physics of S/R/S hybrid
structures in which "R" is a quasi one dimensional semi-
conductor nanowire (NW) with strong Rashba spin orbit
coupling (e.g. InAs or InSb) electrically connected to two
conventional low Tc superconductor leads ( "S" ) [4, 5].
Superconductivity is induced in the spin-orbit coupled
semiconductor by proximity effect due to the supercon-
ducting electrodes. The coexistence of superconductivity
and spin-orbit coupling is a key ingredient for the exis-
tence of MBS's at the interfaces between the R region
and the superconducting S regions.

However, despite the considerable theoretical and ex-
perimental [14] efforts, some challenges still remain be-
fore a real device allowing isolation and manipulation of
MBS's in such geometry can be realized. In particular
the difficulties of tuning the chemical potential of the
semiconductor region µ, controlling the disorder on the
bulk gap as well as optimizing the coupling between the
different materials [15 -- 17] make the realization of such
devices extremely difficult.

All schemes proposed up to now to generate MBS's
substantially use conventional s-wave superconductors
to induce superconductivity and a gap ∆ in the R
nanowire[1]. The role of superconducting pairing is to re-
lax number conservation, thus allowing for the mixing of
particle and hole degrees of freedom. Zeeman spin split-
ting is required to halve the number of degrees of freedom
at low energies, thus generating the elusive neutral (Ma-

jorana) excitation. A simple criterion to induce MBS's at
S/R interfaces is given in terms of the applied magnetic
field Bx oriented along the wire, µ and ∆. The inequality
to be satisfied can be stated as: B 2
x > µ2 + ∆2[4]. Low
critical magnetic fields (Hc) and low gap values charac-
teristic of conventional low Tc superconductors substan-
tially define the limits of the nominal range of dynami-
cal parameters required to observe MBS's. Not only do
Hc and ∆ enter into the criteria to stabilize MBS's, but
they also endanger the feasibility of the experiment in
case high magnetic fields are required. High critical tem-
perature superconductors (HTS) may favor a completely
different approach to experiments on MBS's, since HTS
plaquettes/contacts (even a few micron square) sustain
superconductivity up to a few tenths of Tesla and induce
robust superconductivity in a wide range of barrier ma-
terials. When conventional low-Tc superconductors (e.g.
Nb) are considered, the large difference in the g-factors
for Nb (gN b ∼ 1) and InAs (gInAs ∼ 35) implies that
the in-plane magnetic field B ∼ 0.1T can open a sizable
Zeeman gap in InAs (Vx ≤ 1K) without substantially
suppressing the superconductivity in Nb. However these
conditions holds even more firmly in YBCO contacts be-
cause the YBCO gap is very stable w.r.t. magnetic fields,
despite a doubling of the g−factor (gY BCO ∼ 2).

The induced gap in the NW can be considered of the
order of the bare gap of the superconductor, projected
along the wire direction, provided that the radius of the
wire is negligibly small with respect to the coherence
length ξ of the superconducting material and that no
sizeable barriers are present at the interfaces. As re-
cently pointed out in Ref.
[15], the interface tunnelling
between different materials renormalizes the induced gap
to ∆i = (1 − Z)∆i where Z ∼ (1 + πρ0Vhop2/∆i)−1is
the quasiparticle weight, Vhop mimicks the electron hop-
ping between the superconductor and the NW and ρ0 is
the density of states of the superconductor at the Fermi
energy. The better is the coupling with a larger Vhop,
the smaller becomes Z and the larger is the induced

gap. Z also renormalizes the whole NW Hamiltonian
HN W → HN W = ZHN W which means that, by the same
token, all the NW Hamiltonian parameters are effectively
reduced when Vhop increases. When taking the renormal-
ization into account in the model that we discuss below,
the criterion for the appearance of the topologically non
trivial phase given by Eq.5 becomes

Z 2(B 2 − µ2) > (1 − Z)2 × max(∆L2, ∆R2) .

(1)

This renormalization effect requires caution in the nanos-
trucure design and, interestingly enough, it can be fruit-
fully exploited in the case of HTS proximity. A conve-
nient tradeoff can be found by accepting a rather poor
intermaterial coupling Vhop , due to the very large bare
superconducting gap along the lobe direction, which is al-
most one order of magnitude larger than in conventional
low Tc superconductors. The InAs nanowire mostly rules
the scaling of the proximity effect [18, 20] once good in-
terface conditions are guaranteed between the HTS ma-
terial and the InAs nanowire[21]. The magnetic field can
be very high with negligible effects both on the super-
conducting properties of the HTS electrode and on the
interface transparency.

Here we focus on other functionalities of HTS hybrid

devices which are offered by an anisotropic d-wave or-
der parameter symmetry[19].
In d-wave systems lobes
in the excitation gap of amplitude 20 meV coexist with
nodes, while in conventional s-wave superconductors the
gap value is about or less than 1 meV and uniform in
all directions. In HTS contacts, the crystal axes' orien-
tations with respect to the nanowire can be chosen in
order to maximize the proximity induced ∆. Different
crystal orientations can be currently achieved by bicrys-
tal or biepitaxial techniques [20].

For sake of simplicity, we model the system as an ef-
fective one-dimensional device composed by the NW of
length LN and two superconducting regions (see Fig.1b),
whose effective gaps differ not only in phase but also
in their modulus, depending on the relative crystal ori-
entation (see Fig.2). Effective Hamiltonian parameters,
including the interface renormalization, will be disre-
garded, for the moment, and reintroduced in a second
step.

In the superconducting regions of the nanowire, spin-
orbit interaction and superconductivity coexist. We as-
sume that LN << ξ << LT OT to have penetration of
superconductivity in the whole nanowire.

A Bogoliubov-De Gennes mean field Hamiltonian fully accounts for superconductivity induced in the normal ma-

terial by proximity effect:

m∗ and η are the effective mass and the Rashba spin orbit coupling strength, respectively. Bx = gµBB/2 is the

Angles αR,L, ϑ are defined in Fig.2. φ is an U (1) phase
difference across the junction. Let us choose ϑ zero. De-
pending on the relative orientation of the order param-
eters in the L,R regions with respect to the nanowire,
a wealth of possibilities occur. For an effectively one-
dimensional wire we can set αL = 0 with no loss of gener-
ality. By rotating αR from 0 to π/2 we can continuously
explore all the configurations from lobe-lobe (+/+) to
lobe-antilobe(+/-). Nodal configurations are not inter-
esting here, as we need large superconducting gaps. As

we are searching for MBS's, we will choose only a few
angle configurations to demonstrate the main concepts.

A new space scale x → η m∗ x has been introduced, as

phase whose boundary states are Majorana Fermions [4,
5], provided

where the hamiltonian parameters used here, effectively
include the quasiparticle renormalization weight Z. The
topologically trivial phase, is adiabatically deformable to
the usual Andreev physics [22]. We calculate numerically
the low lying part of the energy spectrum by matching
the eigenfunctions. In order to simplify calculations, we
take the limit LN ∼ 0 by matching the wavefunction and
its derivative at x = 0. As shown in [4], this assumption
does not alter the generality of our results as interaction
terms among Majorana end states are neglected in our
approach. The effects of a finite size wire are shown for
example in Ref.[23].

In Fig. 3 the dispersion relation of MBS's is shown
as a function of the phase difference, φ, between the su-
perconducting pads. For αR < π/4 the Andreev levels
show a single crossing at φ = π. The odd number of
crossings in the Andreev spectrum is the characteristic
signature of the topological non trivial phase, consistent
with that found with conventional s-wave superconduc-
tivity. However, the Andreev spectrum shows an unex-
pected behavior when αR > π/4 i.e. when the effective
induced gaps have opposite signs. In this case, the cross-
ing, which features the zero energy MBS, is still present,
but located at φ = 0. This is specific of the d-wave or-
der parameter. When αR < π/4 the gaps ∆L and ∆R
have the same sign. Therefore, a phase difference of π
between the two order parameters is required, in order
to have an inversion of the sign of the gap between the
two regions S1 and S2. Provided that the appropriate

urations of the order parameter are determined by a suitable
orientation of the electrodes and of the nanowire.

condition for the parameters is met, the sign inversion,
irrespective of the relative strength of the two gaps (and
of the actual value of αR), enforces the crossing to be
localized at φ = 0, and the Majorana excitation with
it. Together with this change, the shape of the disper-
sion relation changes by changing αR, with an increase
of the current I(φ) = ∂E(φ)/∂φ up to a maximum, when
the gaps reach their maximum at αR = 0 or π/2. The
crossing only appears at φ = 0, π, because only at these
points the Hamiltonian is real. Moreover, depending on
the crystal relative arrangements we can have a differ-
ent dispersion for Andreev Bound states as a function of
the phase difference φ.
In both cases a single crossing
at zero energy appears, which reveals the presence of the
MBS, at φ = 0 or π depending on the sign of the product
∆L∆R.

At present, the race to detect signatures of the elusive
Majorana Fermions in an S/NW/S structure is quite ex-
citing [24 -- 27]. A system exploiting d-wave electrodes,
as the one proposed in this work, can inspire hallmark
experiments in the search for Majorana excitations.

Despite the fact that the magnetic field should domi-
nate over the superconductivity, still, a sizable supercon-
ducting gap is needed, as the smaller energy between Vz
and ∆ sets the minimum energy sufficient to wash out
the topological protection of the Majorana excitation. In
this respect, HTS's appear to offer more chances in sta-
bilizing MBS's. Question arises whether nodal quasipar-
ticles in the d-wave [28] topologically trivial supercon-
ductor could affect their stability. As the MBS's imply
strong non local correlations, one is inclined to conclude

that local nodal quasiparticle should be inefficient in pro-
ducing a decay of the Majorana zero energy excitation.
Besides, nodal quasiparticles are strictly at zero energy
if travelling along given directions in an uniform system
d-wave ordering. The presence of the Josephson bar-
rier, inhomogeinity or confined geometry, should move
those states to finite energy.
In the different context
of YBCO grain boundary Josephson Junctions[29, 30],
we have experienced a long lasting quantum coherence
of antinodal quasiparticles, while an efficient relaxation
mechanism could have been the production of nodal
quasiparticles[30, 31]. This is a conforting piece of ev-
idence, but, of course, not a proof, though.

A d-wave induced superconductivity encompasses a
wider range of opportunities to discriminate the presence
of the MBS. Andreev states induced by d-wave pairing
are strongly sensitive to the geometry of the device. The
characteristic increase of the Ic at the lower tempera-
tures, used as a benchmark for the existence of the An-
dreev midgap state in HTS junctions[19], is strongly sup-
pressed when the width of the junction is reduced toward
a quasi 1D device. However, in our devices, an anoma-
lous increase of Ic at low temperatures would persist in
the one-dimensional limit and would be even sharper, the
lower the barrier transparency is. This would unambigu-
ously signals feature that can be only correlated to the
presence of Majorana fermions [32 -- 34]. Prototype struc-
tures using HTS electrodes are being already tested [21].

Moreover, it is a distinctive property of ring struc-
tures with appropriate multi crystal arrangements to en-
tail frustrated d-wave pairing ordering with trapped frac-
tional fluxes in the ground state [28]. The possibility
highlighted in this work, to have MBS localized at 0−
and π− junctions, depending on the phase configuration,
can be exploited in the design of quantum coherent, topo-
logically protected devices, which go beyond the simple
experimental confirmation of this amazing new physics,
to enter the field of applications.

We envisage the possibility of engineering quasi-
degenerate odd fermionic parity states, using a meso-
scopic, charge isolated island, formed by a d-wave tricrys-
tal [32] topologically protected with respect to the exci-
tations.
