Bilayer graphene hosts valley-chiral one dimensional modes at domain walls between regions of
different interlayer potential or stacking order. When such a channel is brought into proximity to a
superconductor, the two electrons of a Cooper pair which tunnel into it move in opposite directions
because they belong to different valleys related by the time-reversal symmetry. This is a kinetic
variant of Cooper pair splitting, which requires neither Coulomb repulsion nor energy filtering but
is enforced by the robustness of the valley isospin in the absence of atomic-scale defects. We derive
an effective model for the guided modes in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, calculate the
conductance carried by split and spin-entangled electron pairs, and interpret it as a result of local
Andreev reflection processes, whereas crossed Andreev reflection is absent.

Creating mobile nonlocal spin-entangled electrons in a
transport experiment with the help of superconductor -- 
normal junctions has attracted a lot of attention in theory
[1 -- 8] and experiment [9 -- 14] because the spin degree of
freedom of the electron could serve as a solid-state qubit
[15]. In the existing experiments, the envisaged process
where a Cooper pair is split over two normal leads is
crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) [16, 17], which is en-
hanced by the repulsive electron-electron interaction on
two quantum dots weakly coupled to the superconduc-
tor [1] or by energy filtering [2, 18]. The basic mech-
anism of these entanglers is not very sensitive to the
specific material used, i.e., the underlying band struc-
ture.
It has been shown that characteristic features of
new materials exhibiting Dirac-cones like graphene or
topological insulators can be useful for splitting Cooper
pairs [7, 19 -- 22]. In these proposals, the efficiency of the
splitting process, in the absence of interactions, relies on
non-protected resonance conditions or the split Cooper
pair is not spin-entangled due to spin-helicity or spin-
polarization of the leads. Helical edge states of the quan-
tum spin Hall regime have, however, been proposed to
detect spin entanglement [8, 23].

Here, we propose to exploit the valley degree of free-
dom in bilayer graphene (BG), where valley-chiral, spin-
degenerate one-dimensional (1D) channels are formed at
domain walls. Such domain walls can be engineered by
switching the sign of an interlayer voltage or by revers-
ing the stacking order [24, 25]. If brought into proximity
to a superconductor, the pairs emitted into the chan-
nel are split, i.e., two electrons propagate in different
directions but remain spin-entangled since, as required
by time-reversal symmetry, the two electrons forming
the Cooper pair in the superconductor are from differ-
ent valleys [26]. As long as the valley degree of free-
dom is robust, the splitting efficiency is unity, indepen-
dent of resonance conditions. The device extends the
upcoming "valleytronics" in graphene [27] to nonlocal

FIG. 1. (a) At a domain wall (red) in BG between different
interlayer voltages ±V0 or different stacking order a topologi-
cal valley-chiral channel forms. Cooper pairs tunneling into it
from a nearby s-wave superconductor (S) are split because the
two electrons belong to opposite valleys K± and thus have op-
posite velocities. They remain spin entangled and propagate
to separate normal leads (N). (b) In each valley two subgap
modes along the domain wall emerge. Energy and momentum
conservation along the NS interface single out four points in
the subgap spectrum at which Cooper pairs are injected.

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs. A 1D channel defined by
opposite stacking order has recently been created exper-
imentally in BG [28] with mean free paths over several
100 nm, demonstrating weak intervalley scattering.
In
this scenario, the normal reflection of an incoming hole
(or electron) and CAR are absent. In the limit of a weak
proximity effect, where the normal transmission through
the proximity region of the channel is almost perfect,
the spin-entangled pair emission with electrons moving
to opposite normal terminals (Fig. 1) is equivalent to lo-
cal Andreev reflection (LAR) processes, opposite to the
normal reflection-dominated case, where CAR produces

entangled pairs.

We analyze the setup of Fig. 1 in two steps: first, we
investigate the influence of the superconductor on the
1D channel by solving a Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG)
equation, and derive an effective 1D model to describe
the proximity effect in the channel. Second, we calculate
the subgap conductance when applying a bias voltage
between the superconductor and the channel using a rate
equation approach. We interpret the subgap transport in
a scattering matrix picture and show that the outgoing
scattered state is a two-particle spin-entangled state on
top of a filled normal-state Fermi sea with a chemical
potential lowered by the bias voltage. To leading order
its weight is given by the LAR amplitude.

Model. -- We consider a BG sheet with Bernal AB
stacking in the presence of an interlayer voltage V (r)
[29]. We model the superconductor region as BG in
which the bands are shifted by a scalar potential U (r)
due to doping and which has an induced s-wave pair-
ing amplitude ∆(r). We employ the low-energy approx-
imation for BG, valid at energies and (inter)layer volt-
ages smaller than the interlayer hopping γ1 (cid:39) 0.3 eV.
Without the superconductor, the valley index χv = ±1
distinguishing the two K-points K± = ±(4π/3a, 0) and
the electron spin s = ±1 ≡↑,↓ are good quantum num-
bers and we write the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation as

4-component spinor is Φχv,s(r) = (uχv,s(r), vχv,s(r))T
where we have introduced the electron uχv,s(r) =
(uA1,χv,s(r), uB2,χv,s(r)) and hole components (u → v)
on the two sublattices. Excitations with energy ε are

In the absence of the superconductor (∆(r) = U (r) =
0) and assuming the modes to propagate along the y-
direction along a domain wall at x = 0, i.e., V (r) =
−V0 sgn(x) with V0 > 0, the topologically confined modes
can be found analytically [24]. The electron and hole
sectors in Eq. (1) decouple. In the electron sector, the
solutions in each half space have the form Φχv,s(r) =

modes decay into the bulk on a length scale of(cid:112)2α/V0,

at 4π

which then is on the order of several 10 nm. This sets
the scale of the separation between the guided mode and
a superconductor required to obtain a proximity effect.
Perturbation theory for superconducting pairing. -- 
Assuming a superconductor/normal interface with trans-
lational invariance along the y-direction, there are three
distinct areas: in the superconductor area, x < −d, the
pairing amplitude ∆(r) = ∆ is finite and U (r) = −US is
negative. The area −d < x < 0 is in the normal state as
before, ∆ = US = 0, but the interlayer voltage is finite,
V = V0 > 0. This region is a tunnel barrier between the
superconductor and the domain wall at the interface to
the third region x > 0, where ∆ = US = 0 and V = −V0.
In this situation guided modes exist at ε < min(V0, ∆)
because states above V0 can propagate in the normal re-
gions and states above ∆ can propagate in the supercon-
ductor. Because of the tunnel barrier the guided modes
are only weakly affected by the superconductor and we
can apply standard quasidegenerate perturbation theory
[30, 31], for which the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 is ob-
tained from HBdG by setting ∆ = U = 0 everywhere and
so the perturbation H1, which adds the missing parts,
is finite only at x < −d. As a result of the perturba-
tion the electron and hole states of the channel acquire
a finite overlap ∆nn(cid:48)(py), where n, n(cid:48) label the subgap
bands. This allows for particle number non-conserving
processes, i.e., Cooper pair transport. To first order only
the electron and hole states belonging to the same subgap
band mix, ∆11 = ∆22, ∆12 = 0. This agrees with the
result one expects when introducing superconductivity
phenomenologically by constructing the BdG equation
directly from the guided modes with a uniform pairing
∆11τx. The second order corrections, which take into ac-
count the modification of the wavefunctions due to the
superconductor, however, reveal that the situation is dif-
ferent in the geometry we consider. The electron hole
overlap differs in both bands, ∆11 (cid:54)= ∆22, and band mix-
ing is finite, ∆12 (cid:54)= 0 (Fig. 2) [32]. This is confirmed by
the full dispersion relation of HBdG we obtain by match-

The combination of energy conservation and approximate
momentum conservation implies that the pair tunneling
probability ∆nn(cid:48)(ε,−ε)2 has a single peak as a function
of ε for each pair n, n(cid:48). Injection into the same subgap

the effective tunneling strength. Note that the conduc-
tance grows with the length of the interface. This is
in contrast to conventional Cooper pair splitters, which
suffer from an exponential suppression in the spatial size.
The reason is that here Cooper pairs are split kinemat-
ically only after having tunneled locally into the chan-
nel, a process which can happen simultaneously along the
whole interface. The conductance contains a central zero-
bias peak and two characteristic side peaks [Fig. 3(a)],
which arise because of the special subgap band structure
and which correspond to the injection points marked in
Fig. 1(b). The peak height is proportional to the induced
superconducting pairings. A factor of 4 arises due to the
spin and valley degeneracy and a factor of 2 due to pair
transport.

scL/R−s (−ε) creates outgoing holes with spin s at energy
EF + ε in the left/right lead, which is the same as an-
nihilating an electron with opposite spin −s at energy
EF − ε. We drop the valley index which is fixed by the
requirement that outgoing modes move away from the
superconducting region and the band index for simplic-
ity [31]. Due to the proximity effect LAR becomes finite.
The key observation is that when LAR occurs, no hole
with spin s at energy EF + ε is transmitted to the other
side. The outgoing mode is therefore occupied by a spin
−s electron at energy EF − ε [Fig. 3(b)]. To see this, we
use Eq. (7) to write the outgoing state in terms of (cid:105)δµ

where individual splitting events are well separated and
it is meaningful to talk about pairs.
In this regime of
interest the perturbative result from the previous section
holds. Only the emitted pairs contribute to the shot noise

Conclusion. -- Our setup allows for highly efficient cre-
ation of nonlocal spin-entangled electrons without the
need for repulsive interaction or energy filters. We note
that the topological channel can be created electrically
in the bulk of the BG sample, completely avoiding sharp
sample edges, the main source of intervalley scattering
[36], which could reduce the splitting efficiency. More-
over, using an electrically tunable channel geometry bal-
listic beamsplitters could be created to prove the spin
entanglement via noise [37], so far an elusive goal. The
spin relaxation and decoherence in BG are expected to
be weak due to the small spin-orbit coupling [38 -- 40] and
the sparsity of nuclear spins.

no outgoing hole on the opposite side, which corresponds to
an electron of opposite spin, momentum and energy (dashed

manifest. It is well established that Cooper pair splitting
is closely related to CAR [33, 34]. This applies if the
dominant process is ordinary reflection.
In our device,
the 1D channel with a proximity-induced superconduct-
ing region is a NSN junction, in which only transmission
through the S-region with amplitude t(ε) and local An-
dreev reflection (an incoming quasiparticle in valley K±
is reflected as an outgoing antiparticle with opposite ve-
locity in valley K∓) with amplitude r(ε) are possible.
We consider the general scattering problem with finite
CAR and normal reflection in the Supplemental Mate-
rial [31]. When a voltage bias δµ is applied between the
superconductor and the channel to extract Cooper pairs,
the incoming modes are filled with holes up to EF + δµ.
Without the superconductor, all are transmitted and fill
the outgoing modes up to EF + δµ, which is equivalent
to a Fermi sea for electrons (cid:105)δµ with the Fermi energy

In the most general case the incoming holes in a NSN
junction can be transmitted (thh), reflected (rhh), or un-
dergo local (reh) or crossed (teh) Andreev reflection. The

Rewriting the hole operators h† in terms of electron op-

we arrive at

so LAR produces nonlocal pairs and CAR produces lo-
cal pairs.
In the situation discussed in the main text,
both CAR and reflection are forbidden, ruling out lo-
cal pairs to all orders, as long as the valley symmetry is
obeyed. Generally speaking it is undesirable to have si-
multaneously strong ordinary reflection and strong LAR
or to have simultaneously strong transmission and strong

CAR to build a Cooper pair splitter useful to create spin
entanglement.

Multiband Andreev reflection

The notation becomes more cumbersome, when both
subgap bands are considered but the considerations are
completely analogous. Without superconductivity the
outgoing scattering state is

where n ∈ {1, 2} is the band index. In the presence of
the superconductor, the transmitted holes can change the
subgap band from n to m with an amplitude tmn(ε). Like
in the one-band case, whenever the energy of an incoming
electron is such that the spectrum of the S region has a
gap, the transmission amplitude tnm(ε) is exponentially
suppressed with the length of the proximity region, and
due to unitarity there is a finite amplitude rnm(ε) for
the spin-s hole to be Andreev reflected locally as a spin-s
electron at energy EF + ε:

The higher order terms in r contain multiple Cooper pairs

and are not necessarily entangled, e.g., the O(r4) contri-

bution is a pure product state in which all states in the
left/right lead at energy EF ± ε are occupied.
