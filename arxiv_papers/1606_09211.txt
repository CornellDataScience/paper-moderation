Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions are nanostructures that auto-oscillate stochastically under
the effect of thermal noise. Recent works showed that despite their stochasticity, such junctions
possess a capability to synchronize to subthreshold voltage drives, in a way that can be enhanced or
controlled by adding noise. In this work, we investigate a system composed of two electrically coupled
junctions, connected in series to a periodic voltage source. We make use of numerical simulations
and of an analytical model to demonstrate that both junctions can be phase-locked to the drive, in
phase or in anti-phase. This synchronization phenomenon can be controlled by both thermal and
electrical noises, although the two types of noises induce qualitatively different behaviors. Namely,
thermal noise can stabilize a regime where one junction is phase-locked to the drive voltage while the
other is blocked in one state. On the contrary, electrical noise causes the junctions to have highly
correlated behaviors and thus cannot induce the latter. These results open the way for the design
of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions that can perform computation through synchronization, and
which harvest the largest part of their energy consumption from thermal noise.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Superparamagnetic tunnel

junctions are stochastic
auto-oscillators, powered by thermal noise1. They nat-
urally transform the fluctuations of thermal noise into a
large telegraphic signal that can be read through a sim-
ple measurement of their electrical resistance. Further-
more, they have the ability to exhibit the phenomenon of
stochastic resonance in which noise enables a weak sig-
nal to be detected by a non linear system2 -- 4. In previous
works, we showed how they can also synchronize to a
weak periodic voltage through both thermal noise and
electrical noise on the drive5,6. The capacity of super-
paramagnetic tunnel junctions to harvest the energy of
noise gives the opportunity to study their physics under
many angles, from sensing to low-power computing. This
requires understanding how these noise-induced phenom-
ena occur in systems composed of several coupled super-
paramagnetic tunnel junctions. Noise-induced synchro-
nization of coupled elements has been studied for several
systems, such as arrays of generic nonlinear elements7 -- 9
or linear chains of diffusely coupled diode resonators10,
but their analysis does not apply to our specific device as
they consider linear coupling and collective phenomena.
Furthermore, these works focus on noise-induced signal
power amplification but do not study frequency-locking
and phase-locking directly.

In this work, we present a theoretical study of noise-
induced synchronization of two electrically coupled su-
perparamagnetic tunnel junctions. Our comprehensive
study is based on numerical simulations. We examine
frequency-locking through the evolution with noise of the
junctions frequencies as well as phase-locking through
time-resolved traces of the junctions resistances. All
results are discussed with the support of an analytical

model based on the evolution with noise of the junctions
switching probabilities. Both numerical and analytical
models were previously validated by direct comparison
to experiments in the case of the synchronization of a
single junction6,11. We examine the differences between
the synchronization phenomena induced by thermal noise
versus those induced by electrical noise on the drive volt-
age.

After presenting our model in the case of a single super-
paramagnetic tunnel junction, we apply it to two junc-
tions connected in series to a periodic voltage source.
We show that both junctions can be synchronized simul-
taneously to the voltage drive. Both in-phase-locking
and anti-phase-locking configurations can be achieved by
choosing the connections of the junctions in the circuit.
These phenomena can be induced and controlled by the
amplitudes of thermal and electrical noises. Specifically,
we show that thermal noise is able to stabilize a hybrid
synchronization regime where at each oscillation of the
drive, one randomly chosen junction is phase-locked to
the drive while the other is blocked in one state. On
the other hand, this regime cannot be achieved by the
addition of electrical noise. The electrical noises on the
two junctions both come from the drive and are thus cor-
related. The switches of the junctions are simultaneous
and triggered by large voltage events.

II. NOISE INDUCED SYNCHRONIZATION OF

A SINGLE JUNCTION

A magnetic tunnel junction is composed of two ferro-
magnets (one with pinned magnetization and one with
free magnetization) and a tunnel barrier sandwiched
between them (Fig.1(a)). The magnetization of the free

layer has two stable states: parallel (P) and anti-parallel
(AP) to the magnetization of the pinned layer. The
anti-parallel state has a higher electrical resistance than
the parallel state. Magnetic tunnel junctions can be
engineered so that the energy barrier between the P and
AP states is low enough to reach the superparamagnetic
regime. This means that the intrinsic thermal noise
in the junction induces random, spontaneous switches
of the magnetization between the P and AP states.
The superparamagnetic tunnel junction behaves as a
noise-powered stochastic oscillator1,5  --  as depicted in
Fig.1(d-e)  --  which does not need any external supply
of energy to run. The phenomenon of spin-transfer
torque12,13 provides a handle over the junction as a
positive voltage stabilizes the AP state (Fig.1(b) and
(d)) while a negative voltage stabilizes the P state
(Fig.1(c) and (e)). The applied dc voltage is defined as
positive from the pinned layer to the free layer. Thermal
energy destabilizes both states.

random number between 0 and 1 is generated. If the ran-
dom number is lower than the switching probability, the
junction changes state.

B. Thermal noise induced synchronization

Synchronization of the junction to the weak periodic
signal can be controlled by different sources of noise. We
first study the influence of thermal noise.

Fig. 2(a) represents the frequency of the junction  --  de-
fined as the mean number of oscillations of the junction's
state per second  --  versus temperature. The frequency
increases with temperature and presents a plateau at the
frequency of the drive Fac. This plateau is a signature
of stochastic resonance and noise-induced synchroniza-
tion17,18.

The junction is considered to be in-phase with the drive
if it is in the AP state when the drive is +V and in the P
state when the drive is -V. In consequence we can define
P+ the probability to phase-lock to the drive and P− the
probability to phase-unlock:

Making the assumption that the free layer of the junc-
tion can be considered as a single domain magnetization
element, the probabilities to leave the AP and P states
within a duration t can be described by a Poisson process:

P+ = PP→AP

= 1 − exp

PAP→P (V, t) = 1 − exp (−φAP (V ) t) ,
PP→AP (V, t) = 1 − exp (−φP (V ) t) .

(2)

The escape rates φAP (P ) are described by the Neel-
Brown model14, and follow the Arrhenius equations.
They can be tuned by the voltage applied to the junction,
through the effect of spin-transfer torque15,16:

First, a junction is submitted to a square periodic volt-
age with frequency Fac = 1/Tac = 1 MHz and with sub-
threshold amplitude V = 0.75V.

We perform numerical simulations of the system as fol-
lows. At each time step of dt = 10ns, the probability for
the junction to switch from one state to the other is com-
puted through equations (1) to (4). A uniform pseudo

For each temperature, the probabilities P+ and P−

are computed analytically and plotted in Fig.2a.

At low temperatures (below 85K), the frequency of the
junction is lower than the drive frequency Fac. Indeed
the drive is too weak to induce synchronization by itself
because its amplitude is sub-threshold (V = 0.75Vc).
We investigate the conditions leading to the occurrence
of synchronization. When the junction and the drive are
out-of-phase, they have a probability P+ to phase-lock
in the next half-period Tac
(before the next switch of the
2
drive). When the junction and the drive are in-phase,
they have a probability 1 − P− to stay phase-locked dur-
ing the next half-period. As the junction is intrinsically

nization. We consider the junction to be synchronized to
the drive for P+ > 0.99 and P− < 0.01. This corresponds
to the temperature range 85K < T < 241K and indeed
we observe that it matches the visual boundaries of the
plateau where the frequency of the junction is equal to
the frequency of the drive.

Above T = 241K, the probability to phase-unlock P−
is higher than 0.01. We observe that the junction reg-
ularly slips out of phase. These parasitic oscillations  -- 
here called glitches  --  raise the frequency of the junction
above Fac and destroy synchronization.

The frequency exhibits again a
plateau at Fac. Noise-induced synchronization with the

drive Vac is achieved for an optimal range of electrical
noise 0.08V < σnoise < 0.39V which corresponds to
(cid:104)P+(cid:105) > 0.99 and (cid:104)P−(cid:105) < 0.01.

In conclusion, thermal and electrical noises induce
nearly identical behaviors in the single junction situa-
tion. For an optimal range of noise, the superparamag-
netic tunnel junction is synchronized to the voltage drive.

tion 1 is connected to the pinned layer of junction 2 the
junctions are said to be head to head.

We now use our model to study the synchronization of
coupled oscillators. We consider two identical junctions
connected in series. The voltages V1 and V2 applied to
each junction depend on the states of both junctions:

In this section we study the case where only thermal
noise is involved. We consider two identical junctions

with RAP (RP ) the resistance corresponding to the AP

is T M R = RAP −RP

Vac = 1.5V to the junctions.

1. Junctions connected head to tail

The numerical simulation is conducted in the same
way as the single junction study. A random number is
generated for each junction.
If both junctions have a
random number lower than their switching probability,
the precise times of switching corresponding to each
random number are computed. Two cases arise. Either
the times of switching are separated by less than 1 ns
and both junctions switch simultaneously (1 ns is the
typical duration of a switch19). Either the times of
switching are separated by more than 1 ns, in which case
the junction with the lowest switching time switches
first. Then the switching time of the other junction
has to be recomputed, because its switching probability
is different now that the first junction has switched,
modifying the applied voltage.

second plateau at half the frequency of the drive, be-
tween T = 40K and T = 68K . Figure 4A presents the
evolution with time of the voltage drive and the resis-
tances of both junctions. In panels (d), (e) and (f) the
temperature is 130K which corresponds to the plateau
at the drive frequency. As expected, both junctions are
locked in phase with the drive. In panels (a), (b) and (c)
the temperature is 60K which corresponds to the plateau
at half the drive frequency. We observe that, at each pe-
riod of the drive, one junction is locked in phase with
the drive while the other is blocked in the P state. The
phase-locked junction alternates randomly from period
to period.
In the Appendix, we use further numerical simulations
and our analytical model to investigate the influence of
the tunnel magneto-resistance and the drive frequency on
the existence and width of the plateaus. We observe that
a high tunnel magneto-resistance widens the plateau at
Fac/2 and narrows the plateau at Fac. A 300% TMR is a
good illustration of the effect of the coupling while main-
taining a realistic tunnel magneto-resistance. A drive fre-
quency of Fac = 10kHz enables the system to exhibit two
significant synchronization plateaus, at Fac and Fac/2.

The frequencies of both junctions are plotted in black
in Figure 3. They are superimposed for all temperatures.
The plateau at the frequency of the drive, characteristic
of synchronization, is present between T = 111K and
T = 170K. Surprisingly, we observe the existence of a

To get a quantitative understanding of this phe-
nomenon we define six different probabilities which cor-
respond to the possible switching probabilities of the
junctions for the different drive and resistances config-
urations:

in phase with the drive. This gives rise to the frequency
plateau at Fac and is illustrated on the "Temperature =
130K" panel of Fig. 4B.
P5 is the probability to phase-unlock with the drive,
both when the drive is in the +V and −V states (Fig.4A).
For temperatures above 170K, P5 is larger than 0.01 so
glitches appear and synchronization is destroyed.

2. Junctions connected head to head

When both junctions are in the same state, a voltage
Vac
is applied to each. When they are in different states,
2
is applied to the junction in the AP state while Vac
5

is applied to the junction in the P state.

Therefore, P1 and P6 correspond to the switching prob-
abilities of a junction in the AP state when the other
junction is in the P state. P3 and P4 correspond to the
switching probabilities of a junction in the P state when
the other junction is in the AP state. P2 and P5 corre-
spond to the switching probabilities when both junctions
are in the same state, P or AP.

In Figure 3 the frequencies of junctions 1 and 2 as well
as the probabilities P2, P3, P4 and P5 are plotted versus
temperature. The probabilities P1 and P6 do not appear
on this graph as P1 (cid:39) 1 and P6 < 0.01 within the studied
temperature range. Figure 4B illustrates the switching
cycles of both junctions.

The plateau at half the drive frequency can be inter-
preted as follows and depicted on Fig. 4B. We use the
following example as a starting point: the drive voltage
is +V = 1.5V and both junctions are in the P state. (A
similar reasoning can be made for any other initial con-
ditions.) Fig. 3 shows that P2 > 0.99. Therefore, both
junctions have a high probability (P2) to switch in the
AP state in the following half period Tac
2 . One junction
switches to the AP state as depicted in Fig. 4B. The
switching probabilities are P6 for the junction in the AP
state and P3 for the junction in the P state. As both
probabilities P6 and P3 are below 0.01, both junctions
remain in their state until the next switch of the drive,
depicted by the "T = 60K" arrow in Fig. 4A. When the
drive switches from +V to −V the switching probabil-
ities become P1 for the junction in the AP state and
P4 for the junction in the P state. As P4 < 0.01 while
P1 > 0.99, the junction in the AP state switches to the
P state. Both junctions are in the P state with a switch-
ing probability of P5 < 0.01: they remain in their state
until the next switch of the drive. Then, their switch-
ing probabilities become P2 and the cycle starts again.
To summarize, at each oscillation cycle of the drive, one
random junction is locked in phase with the drive while
the other is blocked in the P state, leading to a mean
frequency of Fac
for both junctions. This is depicted on
2
the the "Temperature = 60K" panel of Fig. 4B.
For 111K < T < 170K, P3 is larger than 0.99. Con-
siderations similar the the study of the 40 − 68K range,
depicted in Fig. 4A, show that both junctions are locked

R2

R1+R2

We now consider that junction 2 is connected head
to head with junction 1.
In that case, the voltage
applied to the junction, and governing the probabilities
is V2 = −Vac
. We observe in Fig. 3(a) that the
frequencies of junctions 1 and 2  --  plotted in grey  --  are
equal at all temperatures. The frequency of the junctions
increases with the temperature. Contrary to the case
where the junctions are head to tail, a single plateau at
the drive frequency Fac is observed, between T = 40K
and T = 126K. Panels (g), (h) and (i) of Fig. 4B depict
the evolution with time of the voltage drive, and the
states of junctions 1 and 2, for a temperature of T=75K.
This regime corresponds to the plateau and we observe
that junction 1 is locked in phase with the drive while
junction 2 is locked in anti-phase with the drive. These
results can be interpreted with the same reasoning as in
the head to tail case and as depicted in Fig. 4A.

B. Electrical noise induced synchronization

RP

In this section, we now control synchronization by in-
jection of electrical noise. Contrary to the single junction
case, we show that, in the two junctions case, electri-
cal noise induces a behavior qualitatively different from
the one induced by thermal noise. We consider two
identical junctions which a tunnel magneto-resistance of
T M R = RAP −RP
= 100%. As shown in the Appendix,
this is high enough to have a signal that can be detected
easily and low enough to exhibit a significant synchro-
nization plateau.
The switching probabilities are the averaged probabili-
ties (cid:104)P1(cid:105) to (cid:104)P6(cid:105) over all possible values of N (t).
In Fig.5 the frequencies of junctions 1 and 2 as well as
the average probabilities (cid:104)P1(cid:105) to (cid:104)P6(cid:105) are plotted versus
the standard deviation of the noise distribution, both for
the configurations where the junctions are head to tail
and head to head.

1. Junctions connected head to tail

Both junctions have the same frequency at all levels of
noise. We do not observe any synchronization at Fac
for

the junctions frequency in the range of noise for which
(cid:104)P2(cid:105) > 0.99 and (cid:104)P3(cid:105) < 0.01. This can be interpreted

When the junctions are head to head, the top junction is 1 and the bottom junction is 2.

as follows. In the thermal noise study, the escape rates
are constant in time for a given temperature. The prob-
ability of switching at a given time is low but, because
it is sustained over a long time, the probability for one
junction to switch eventually is high. The situation is

different when electrical noise is added on the drive. The
distribution of the voltage from the electrical noise is
Gaussian. As the noise is on the drive which is applied

FIG. 5. The evolution of the frequency of the junctions is plotted versus the standard deviation of the Gaussian electrical
noise. The frequency of junction 1 is represented with squares and the frequency of junction 2 is represented with circles. In
the case where both junctions are head to tail the symbols are black whereas in the case where the junctions are head to head
the symbols are grey. The drive frequency Fac as well a half the drive frequency Fac
2 are represented by black horizontal lines.
The average probabilities to switch during Tac

to light orange. The dashed vertical lines represent the electrical noise levels at which P2 = 0.99, P3 = 0.99, P5 = 0.01 and

to one. Thus both junctions switch simultaneously.
Therefore, when the drive switches to +V , either a high
value voltage event occurs and both junctions switch
simultaneously in the AP state; either no high voltage
event occur, and only one junction switches in the AP
state while the other remains blocked in the P state
as explained in section III A 1. As the noise level is
increased, more high value voltage events occur and
thus more simultaneous switches of the junctions occur.
These observations pin a fundamental physical difference
between internal and external noise.

For 0.58V < σnoise < 0.84V the frequency of the
junctions is equal to the drive frequency Fac.
Indeed
(cid:104)P3(cid:105) > 0.99 and (cid:104)P5(cid:105) < 0.01. Both junctions are
synchronized with the drive, in the same way as in the
thermal noise study. For σnoise > 0.84V, (cid:104)P5(cid:105) is larger
than 0.01 so glitches appear and synchronization is lost.

2. Junctions connected head to head

Both junctions have the same frequency for all levels of
noise. For 0.16V < σnoise < 0.72V the frequency of the
junctions is equal to the frequency of the drive Fac. The
behaviors of both junctions are the same as in the thermal
noise study: junction 1 is locked in-phase while junction

2 is locked in anti-phase with the drive. (cid:104)P6(cid:105) > (cid:104)P4(cid:105) so
synchronization is lost when (cid:104)P6(cid:105) > 0.01, which occurs
when σnoise > 0.72V.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work we have investigated the noise-induced
synchronization of one then two electrically coupled
stochastic magnetic oscillators with a periodic drive. We
have shown that both thermal and electrical noise can
induce synchronization of two coupled superparamag-
netic tunnel junctions with a sub-threshold voltage drive.
When the junctions are head to tail, both are synchro-
nized in-phase with the drive for an optimal level of noise.
When the junctions are head to head, one is synchronized
in-phase with the drive while the other is synchronized
in anti-phase. Furthermore, this study has enabled us to
highlight a fundamental difference between the synchro-
nization phenomena induced by thermal and electrical
noise. Indeed, the fact that electrical noise makes the es-
cape rates probabilistic themselves and that the electrical
noise is correlated for both junctions lead to simultaneous
switches of the two junctions - while this does not occur
for thermal noise. We have provided an intuitive analytic
understanding of how one or several coupled stochastic
oscillators respond to a periodic drive.

and synchronization of several stochastic oscillators in
various configurations. The results will be useful for un-
derstanding and designing networks of coupled stochastic
oscillators. Among potential applications of such net-
works, bio-inspired computing is particularly promising,
in particular as it allows taking advantage of noise and
stochasticity for processing information. Indeed networks
of coupled oscillators can perform pattern recognition
and classification through synchronization20,21.
Imple-
menting these networks with sub-threshold synchroniza-
tion of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions would allow
achieving such cognitive tasks at low energy cost.

Appendix: Effects of magneto-resistance and drive

frequency

In this appendix we study the effects of tunnel
magneto-resistance and drive frequency on noise induced
synchronization of two superparamagnetic tunnel junc-
tions, connected head to tail. Two identical superpara-
magnetic tunnel junctions of energy barrier such that
∆E = 30kBT studied at T = 50K are submitted to
a periodic drive of amplitude V = 1.5Vc. The analyti-
cal model is used to compute the width in temperature
of both synchronization plateaus, for various drive fre-
quencies and magneto-resistance values. The results are
presented in Figure 6 for the F = Fac plateau and in
Figure 7 for the F = Fac/2 plateau.

We observe that increasing the tunnel magneto-
resistance widens the plateau at F = Fac/2 and narrows
the plateau at F = Fac. When the junctions are in dif-
ferent states, the ratio between the voltage received by

9

the junction in the AP state and the junction in the P
state increases with the RAP /RP ratio, which strength-
ens the coupling and favors the F = Fac/2 regime.
For RAP = RP there is no tunnel magneto-resistance
and the plateau at F = Fac/2 is absent. The effect
of drive frequency is non-monotonous. Drive frequen-
cies too high compared to the natural frequency of the
junctions (which depends on the energy barrier) prevent
the apparition of synchronization plateaus. On the other
side, as temperature increases the frequency of the junc-
tion, lowering the drive frequency narrows the tempera-
ture range which can induce synchronization.

The same study is conducted in the case of syn-
chronization induced by electrical noise.
Figure 8
presents the influence of drive frequency and tunnel
magneto-resistance on the width of the synchronization
plateau at Fac. We observe that the plateau is widest
for low magneto-resistances and high drive frequencies.
Numerical simulations show that no synchronization
plateau can be observed at Fac/2, no matter the value
of the magneto-resistance.
