Novel approaches to DNA sequencing and detection require the measurement of electrical currents
between metal probes immersed in ionic solution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that these
systems maintain large background currents with a transient response that decays very slowly in
time and noise that increases with ionic concentration. Using a non-equilibrium stochastic model,
we obtain an analytical expression for the ionic current that shows these results are due to a fast
electrochemical reaction at the electrode surface followed by the slow formation of a diffusion layer.
During the latter, ions translocate in the weak electric field generated after the initial rapid screening
of the strong fields near the electrode surfaces. Our theoretical results are in very good agreement
with experimental findings.

Single-molecule detection using micro/nano-fluidic de-
vices has recently attracted quite a lot of attention [1 -- 
4].
In particular, solid-state nanopores [5 -- 8], in which
translocated molecules can be detected by electrical sig-
nals [9 -- 11], are expected to become one of the core tech-
nologies for next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing.
As part of this approach, the tunneling current through
nucleotides as they translocate through the nanochan-
nel was recently measured using nanometer gap elec-
trodes made by a mechanically controllable break junc-
tion (MCBJ) [12 -- 16].
In addition to information on
single nucleotides, the measured electrical signals have
contributions from ionic currents due to the presence of
the electrolyte solution. Those signals are usually hid-
den within the inevitable noise in the nanofluidic system.
Clarifying the mechanisms responsible for the behavior
of these "background" currents is critical to the devel-
opment of DNA sequencing approaches based on elec-
tronic transport. Their study is also of relevance for any
nanofluidic technology that employs electrodes in solu-
tion, e.g., for the improvement of the energy storage ca-
pabilities of electrochemical capacitors [17 -- 19].

In this letter, we experimentally investigate electrical
currents generated by electrodes in an electrolyte solu-
tion. We find a transient electrical response that decays
very slowly and an associated noise that increases with
increasing ionic solution concentration. We develop a
theoretical understanding of these effects that is in very
good agreement with the experimental observations and
reveals the rich behavior contained in the electrochemical
response.

FIG. 1. (Color online) (a) Schematic illustration and (b) SEM
image of MCBJ electrodes, (c) transient current response of
NaCl aqueous solution depending on salt concentrations and
applied electric potentials, and (d) current response for a con-
centration of 200 mM NaCl at various voltages. Slow current
decays of about 1 s can be observed after rapid increase in
the ionic current (see also supplementary Fig. S1 and Table
S1).

of a MCBJ made with Au electrodes. The lithographi-
cally defined nano-junction is fabricated on a polyimide-
coated phosphor bronze substrate. It consists of 30 nm
thick Au/Cr wires of approximately 10 mm end-to-end
length and width tapered from 10 µm to 1µm along the
length. We create a pair of nanoelectrodes using a self-

breaking technique [12], which forms 1 nm electrode gap
with atomically sharp Au tips sensitive enough to de-
tect single molecules by a tunneling current [14 -- 16]. In
our experimental setup, the electrodes are symmetrically
placed in a liquid container of 2 mm diameter. Therefore,
large surfaces (∼ 10−8 m2) of the lead line are exposed
to the electrolyte solution, which cause the background
current with noises as shown in Fig. 1(c). Here, the elec-
trical response of NaCl solution was measured for var-
ious salt concentrations under constant dc voltages at
10 kHz by using a custom-built setup [16] (see also sup-
plementary materials). From Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), the
transient response includes a rapid increase and subse-
quent slow decay of the ionic current. Particularly, the
time constant increases with increasing molarity and ap-
plied potential, and is on the order of 1 s for the parame-
ter regimes studied (see also supplementary Fig. S1 and
Table S1). Assuming an equivalent circuit, this system
would then consist of a 1 GΩ resistance evaluated from
the current -- voltage characteristics and a 1 nF capacitor.
However, such a huge resistance and small capacitance
in the narrow space cannot be explained by the conven-
tional macroscopic models. We then set to understand
these features by employing a microscopic model.

Ionic motion in aqueous solutions can be expressed by
Newton's equation of motion with fluctuation and dis-
sipation. The motion of a particle affected by collisions
from solvent molecules in external force fields is expressed
by m v = −ξv + F + R, where m is the mass, v is the
velocity, ξ is the friction coefficient, F is the force caused
by the potential field, and R is the random force from
the solvent molecules. In such a system, when an electric
field is applied, the uniform field spreads in the solu-
tion at first and ions will respond at each point in space.
Subsequently the electric field rapidly shrinks due to the
screening effect very near the electrode surfaces [20 -- 22].
In the next stage, the ions gradually form a diffusion
layer, interacting with each other.

In order to elucidate the scale of phenomena (and
hence a better understanding of the underlying physics)
we consider the one-dimensional ionic current densities
ji(x, t) due to the migration and diffusion of each of the
ionic species i in aqueous solution. Taking into account
the stochastic process in electrolyte solutions, ionic mo-
tions can be expressed by a Nernst -- Planck equation for
each species [22]:

(1)

where ρi(x, t) is the charge density expressed by the va-
lence zi, the number density ni(x, t), and the elementary
charge e: ρi = zieni, and Di is the diffusion coefficient.
The coordinate x is defined in an interval of x ∈ (0, L)
where the electrode surface is at x = 0 and the thickness
of diffusion layer is L. Ionic migration is driven by the
electrostatic force due to the applied potential and thus

2

Fi can be represented by the gradient of potential φ such
that Fi = −zie∇φ. The relation between φ and ρi is ex-
pressed by the Poisson equation: −ε△φ = Pi ρi, where
ε is the dielectric constant of the solution. The summa-
tion is taken for all species that contribute to φ. The
ionic density and the electrostatic potential should be
determined self-consistently to solve the non-linear par-
tial differential equation. Taking into account the effect
of noise as shown in the experimental result (Fig. 1(c)),
source terms are added and thus Eqs. (1) become

where fir are constants depending on the current density
and noise, and ϕir are the phase shifts at t = 0. In the
numerical solution, φ depends only on the displacement
of ions and thus it is treated as independent of time in
the short interval. The smallest time step, which is large
enough to represent the stochastic process, should be de-
termined properly to maintain constraints at boundaries
and electroneutrality. The source terms represent noise
generated at x = 0 and induce external flux in the do-
main. As a first step, we consider Gaussian white noise,
although it is known that noises detected in micro/nano-
fluidic devices usually show also flicker noise [23 -- 25]. The
parameters ωir and ϕir are generated by Gaussian [26]
and uniform probability distributions, respectively.

We apply this model to evaluate the ionic current near
a Au electrode in a NaCl solution. At the negatively
charged cathode surface, Na+ is highly concentrated re-
gardless of anion species.
In the numerical analysis, L
is taken as a constant for each molarity. The range
of applied potentials is according to the practical po-
tentials in aqueous solutions: φ(0) = −0.01 to −1 V
for φ(L) = 0 V fixed. The valence is +1 and −1 for
Na+ and Cl−, respectively. The diffusion coefficients are
known: DNa+ =1.35×10−9 m2/s and DCl−=2.03×10−9
m2/s [27]. The dielectric constant and temperature are
set to ε=78.4ε0 [28] where ε0 is the dielectric constant
of vacuum and T =298.15 K, respectively. More details

FIG. 2.
(Color online) Time constant τ of the transient
response of (a) Na+ and (b) Cl− in aqueous solution as a
function of V /L where V = φ(L) − φ(0); τ and V /L show
τ ∝ (V /L)−2.15 for Na+ and τ ∝ (V /L)−2.05 for Cl− fitting
the computational data at 1 mM. Experimental results (Fig.
1(c)) are also shown in insets.

of computational methods are described in the supple-
mentary materials. As a first step, the time constant
τ =L2/Dλ of the transient response can be evaluated by
solving the homogeneous equation of Eq. (5) for the two
component system, focusing on the largest τ that mainly
causes the slow decay of the response.

Figure 2 shows τ for Na+ and Cl− as a function of the
ratio of V = φ(L)−φ(0) to L for the molarity of 1, 10, 50,
and 100 mM, where V /L merely expresses a fraction of
the applied potential and the length, but not the electric
field in the system. It is found that τ tends to be propor-
tional to (V /L)ζ where ζ=−2.15 for Na+ and −2.05 for
Cl− resulting from the fits of the computational data at
1 mM. It can then be predicted that τ ∝ (V /L)−2 at the
dilute limit, since the second term on the left-hand side
of Eq. (5) becomes dominant as n∗
i ∼ 0. On the other
hand, the gradient decreases as the molarity increases due
to the strong screening of the electrode surface. These
results suggest that ions rapidly respond to the strong
electric field near the electrode surface and that on the
other hand τ becomes large in the weak field that exists
far away from the electrode. The magnitude of τ is ex-
pected to be on the order of 1 s for the electric field of
103 V/m. For comparison, τ evaluated from our exper-
imental results (Fig. 1(c), supplementary Fig. S1, and
Table S1) is also presented in Fig. 2. In order to evalu-
ate τ from the experimental results, the L is fixed at 1.57
mm taking into account the longest length of the electric
field line in the system (see Supplementary materials).
The theoretical evaluations are then in close agreement
with the experimental results. Furthermore, the series of
τ resulting from the 200 mM solution is expected to show
negative gradient if the L becomes large with increasing
the applied potential.

On the other hand, the above model cannot treat
chemical reactions and the charge transfer explicitly. In

FIG. 3. (Color online) Time evolution of (a) current density
of 10 (purple), 50 (blue), 100 (orange), and 200 (red) mM
NaCl solution where τ of Na+ is also shown in inset, and
(b) number density of Na+ and Cl− (inset) at x = 0, which
are normalized by each bulk density n0. Computations are
performed for V = φ(L) − φ(0) = 0.3 V and L = 40 nm.

order to replicate constant currents at long time and
noises with respect to the electrochemical reactions [20],
we then apply source terms for Na+. Figure 3 shows
current density and normalized number density of each
species obtained from 10, 50, 100, and 200 mM NaCl
solutions as a function of time. Source terms  --  to rep-
resent the Gaussian white noise  --  are added to Eq. (2).
The zeroth source term fNa+r=0 is applied only for Na+
in order to determine the current density at the steady
state. We set fNa+r=0=−αe2n0D(φ(L) − φ(0))/LkBT ,
based on the Nernst -- Einstein relation, where n0 is the
number density of bulk and α is a constant.
In addi-
tion, the amplitude of the noise is determined to be pro-
portional to square root of the bulk density based on
the surface charge density [22] such that fNa+r = β√n0
with a constant β common for each molarity.
fNa+r
is determined from a fraction of fNa+r=0 for 10 mM

such that β = −fNa+r=0/α√n0. We perform compu-

tations for a case of α = 1, β = 100, L = 40 nm, and
V = 0.3 V. The total ionic current density is evaluated

as Pi(ji(x → 0) − ji(x → L)). As shown in Fig. 3(a),

rapid increases and subsequent decays in the net current
density are observed at the moment when the electric
potential is applied. The time constant of Na+ tends to
become large as the molarity increases as shown in the
inset of Fig. 3(a). τ ∼ 0.1 µs, obtained from L = 40 nm
and V = 0.3 V (V /L ∼ 107 V/m), closely corresponds to
the result from Fig. 2 . This trend is in close agreement
with the experimental results (Fig. 1(c)). Cl− also shows
large τ , but does not contribute to the current density at
the cathode side due to the extremely low density near
the surface. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the response in the
current density is obviously caused by the prominent in-
crease and subsequent decrease of Na+ at the surface.
Furthermore, the effect of noise tends to be relatively
weaker as the molarity increases. This is a reason why
the noise is suppressed due to the highly screened surface.

FIG. 4. (Color online) Normalized density distribution of (a)
Na+ and (b) Cl− for 10 (purple), 50 (blue), 100 (orange),
and 200 (red) mM and (c) the electrostatic potential (solid
line) and the electric field (dashed line) that is also shown in
logarithmic scale in inset. These characteristics are obtained
from data at t = 1.0 µs in Fig. 3 (see also supplementary Fig.
S3).

Figure 4(a) shows density distributions of Na+ at
t = 1.0 µs. For each concentration, a minimum peak
of Na+ is found near the surface. This peak implies that
part of the ions tends to adsorb on the electrode surface
and the others separate forming density gradients.
In
the case of Cl− as shown in Fig. 4(b), the concentration
is depleted near the electrode surface and approaches its
bulk density as x increases. Due to these distributions,
the electrostatic potentials show extremely steep gradi-
ents near the electrode surface, as shown in Fig. 4(c).
It is found that the cathode surface is strongly screened
by Na+ and this tendency is apparent as the molarity
increases. In the 100 mM solution, the strength of the
electric field is two orders of magnitude different between
both ends. Despite the strong screening, however, weak
fields also seem to exist widely in the solution, which
is inevitable to induce ionic current due to transport of
electrolytes. The above discussion can be applied to the
anode side, although results may exhibit small differences
due to the different diffusion coefficient of Na+ and Cl−.

In conclusion, we have reported a combined experi-
mental and theoretical study of electrical currents of elec-
trodes in solution. We have shown that this current is
the result of different processes. In particular the long
duration of the initial current response is due to the dif-
fusion layer formation where ions respond to the weak
electric fields remaining after the rapid screening at the
electrode surface. These are relevant for DNA sequencing
approaches presently pursued as well as electrochemical
capacitors for high energy density storage.
