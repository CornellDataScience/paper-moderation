Accessing intrinsic properties of a graphene device can be hindered by the influence

of contact electrodes. Here, we capacitively couple graphene devices to supercon-

ducting resonant circuits and observe clear changes in the resonance- frequency and

-widths originating from the internal charge dynamics of graphene. This allows us to

extract the density of states and charge relaxation resistance in graphene p-n junc-

tions without the need of electrical contacts. The presented characterizations pave a

fast, sensitive and non-invasive measurement of graphene nanocircuits.

INTRODUCTION

In the past decade, extensive studies on graphene have unfolded interesting physics of

Dirac particles on chip1–4. Up to now the main technique to study the electronic prop-

erties of graphene has been low frequency lock-in technique where electrical contacts are

needed for conductance measurements. The key drawbacks of contact electrodes are highly

doped regions in the vicinity of the contacts resulting in unwanted p-n junctions5 and scat-

tering6 of charge carriers. In addition, added resist residues from lithography can degrade

the metal-graphene interfacial properties7 or even the overall device quality. An impor-

tant example of this is graphene spintronics8, where device performance is often limited

by the contacts, which cause spin-relaxation and decrease of the spin-lifetime9–12. There-

fore, contact-less characterization, such as, microwave absorption13 can open up new ways

to probe inherent properties of the studied system. Here, we demonstrate such a contact-

less measurement scheme by capacitively coupling graphene devices to a gigahertz resonant

circuit, stub tuner14. This circuit allows us to extract both the quantum capacitance and

the charge relaxation resistance with a single measurement even in the absence of electrical

contacts.

We have used high mobility graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride15,16 which

separates the graphene from external perturbations and allows local gating of the graphene

flake. By forming a p-n junction the internal charge dynamics of the graphene circuit can

be probed and by analyzing the microwave response of the circuit the charge relaxation

resistance as well as the quantum capacitance can be inferred. Our measurements allow us

to study p-n junctions in a contact-less way, which are potential building blocks of electron

optical devices17–23.

II. DEVICE LAYOUT

Figure 1 shows the layout of a typical device. The stub tuner circuit is based on two

transmission lines TL1 and TL2 of lengths l and d, respectively, each close to λ/414. The

circuit is patterned using a 100 nm thick niobium film by e-beam lithography and subsequent

dry etching with Ar/Cl2. To minimize microwave losses, high resistive silicon substrates

(with 170 nm of SiO2 on top) are used. The signal line of TL1 features a slit of width

2

∼450 nm near the end before terminating in the ground plane as shown in Fig. 1(b,c). We
place the graphene stack, encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), over the slit. The

hBN/graphene/hBN stack is prepared using the dry transfer method described in Refs. 15

and 24, and positioned in the middle of the slit such that parts of the flake lie on the signal

line and parts on the ground plane. We then etch the stack with SF6 in a reactive ion etcher

to create a well defined rectangular geometry. Some bubbles resulting from the transfer can

also be seen in Fig. 1(c). Raman spectra are taken to confirm the single layer nature of

Since there are no evaporated contacts on graphene, the same circuit can be employed
for different stack geometry. We first fabricated a device with stack dimensions W × L of
6.5 µm × 13 µm (device A), where W and L respectively denote the width and length of
the rectangular graphene. After measurements on device A, the stack is etched into new
dimensions of 6.5 µm × 7.2 µm (device B). For both devices, a graphene area of 6.5 µm ×
3.4 µm stays on the signal (gate) line, see Fig. 1(c). The graphene sections lying above the
ground plane had areas of 6.5 µm× 9.6 µm for device A, and 6.5 µm× 3.8 µm for device B.
Device A is hence asymmetric while B is quasi symmetric around the slit. More importantly,

two devices on the same circuit with the same graphene flake but different geometry provide
consistency checks. A third symmetric device C of dimensions 5 µm× 12 µm with a separate
resonator circuit and a different graphene stack was also measured.

III. MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLE

We extract the graphene properties by measuring the complex reflection coefficient of

the stub-tuner, which depends on the RF admittance of a load25. The reflected part of

the RF (radio frequency) probe signal fed into the launcher port of the circuit is measured

using a vector network analyzer. To tune the Fermi level of the graphene a DC voltage,

VG, is also applied to the launcher port with the help of a bias tee, as shown in Fig. 1(a).

The gate voltage changes (locally) the carrier density and hence the quantum capacitance.

By analyzing the response of the circuit, changes in differential capacitance, related to the

quantum capacitance CQ and in dissipation, related to charge relaxation resistance R can
be extracted. All reflectance measurements are performed at an input power of −110 dBm
and at temperature of 20 mK.

To understand the effect of gating, we divide the graphene into two areas denoted by

A1 and A2 in Fig. 1(c). A gate voltage on the signal line induces charges on the part of

graphene flake above it. Since the total number of charges in graphene in absence of a

contact cannot change, charges on one part must be taken from the other. For a pristine

graphene with the Fermi level at the charge neutrality point (CNP) without gating, this

results in the formation of a p-n junction near the slit at each gate voltage. However, when

a finite offset doping is present an offset voltage has to be applied and the charge neutrality

4

is reached at two different gate voltages, once for each part of graphene. At voltages higher

than these offset voltages (in absolute value) a p-n junction is present in the graphene. The

charge carrier density changes rapidly close to the slit, but it is constant further away from

the slit. Due to different areas A1 and A2, the applied gate voltage results into different

charge densities, but equal and opposite total charge on the two sides.

In the transmission line geometry, the RF electric field emerges from the signal plane

and terminate on the ground plane. While the field lines are quasi-perpendicular to the

graphene surface further away from the slit, they become parallel and relatively stronger in

magnitude near the slit. The field distribution hence probes both the properties of the bulk

graphene (homogeneous charge distribution) and the junction graphene (inhomogeneous

charge distribution). For simplicity, we model the graphene as lumped one dimensional

elements of capacitance and resistance as shown in Fig. 1(d). The graphene impedance is
then simply given as ZG ∼ R + 1/(jωC) with the total series capacitance C and resistance
R as

where ω = 2πf the angular frequency. Thus CQ = CQ1CQ2/(CQ1 + CQ2) and CG =

device. We have assumed that the junction capacitance C12 is relatively small so that the
junction resistance R12 (cid:28) 1/(ωC12). Moreover, we ignore the parallel slit capacitance Cslit
which is small and gate independent. Together with the load ZG, the reflectance response Γ

Figure 2(a) shows a color map of frequency and gate voltage response of the reflected

signal for device B. Large frequency shifts at two gate voltages can be observed near VG = 0.

These can be identified as points where either part of the graphene flake is driven charge

neutral. At higher gate voltages, p-n junctions are formed in between the unipolar regimes.

This behaviour is observed in all our devices, suggesting the presence of a finite offset

doping in the system. From the vertical cuts of the map shown in Fig. 2(b), changes in

the resonance-depth, -width and -frequency are apparent. Naively, a pure capacitive load

should shift the resonance frequency, while a pure resistive load changes dissipation of the

system.

To quantitatively extract ZG, we first need to extract the parameters l, d, α and eff

from the reflectance measurements of the same circuit without any graphene stack. To this

end, we simply ash the graphene stack away using Ar/O2 plasma. The frequency response

of the open circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b) together with a fit to Eq. 3 with
ZG = ∞. We extract l ≈ 10.57 mm and d ≈ 10.39 mm, α ≈ 0.0025 m−1 and the effective
dielectric constant eff ≈ 6.1. The loss constant corresponds to an internal quality factor of
25,000 which is readily achieved with superconducting Nb circuits. The extracted lengths

are within 1% of the designed geometric lengths. Moreover, the resonance frequency of the

open stub tuner (2.886 GHz) is larger than the values observed in Fig. 2(a), confirming the

capacitive load of our devices. We now fix the extracted parameters from open circuit, and

fit the resonance spectra to deduce R and C. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the fitting to Eq. 3
yields R = 118 Ω, C = 18.2 fF for VG = −2 V and R = 328 Ω and C = 17.2 fF for VG = 1 V.
Similar fitting is performed at all gate voltages and deduced C and R are plotted in Fig. 3

and 4.

As shown in Fig. 3, we observe for both devices a double dip feature in the extracted

capacitance near VG = 0 V and its saturation at higher voltages. While the dips have

similar widths for device B, these are quite different for device A. This again results from

the asymmetric gating of the two areas of graphene. To understand the general dependence,

we look back at the individual capacitance contributions in Eq. 1. Geometric capacitance

CGi with i = 1, 2 is simply given by CGi = Ai0BN/d, where 0 is the vacuum permittivity,

BN the dielectric constant, and d = 21.5 nm the thickness of the bottom hBN estimated

7

from AFM measurements. Additionally, the quantum capacitance can be derived from the
density of states (DoS) as CQ/A = e2·DoS. The resulting dependence of CQ in graphene
with gate voltage V is then explicitly given as27–30

values are different for the two devices because different flake areas yield different CG. In
contrast, near charge neutrality, CQ (cid:46) CG, the quantum capacitance starts to dominate.
The fact that C does not approach zero can be attributed to the impurity induced doping
(cid:104)n2
imp,i(cid:105), with i = 1, 2, resulting from charge puddles31. To this end, we replace ni(V ) with a
imp,i. The knowledge of most of the
total carrier density including this factor:
relevant parameters allows us to fit the capacitance curves with BN, nimp and vF as fitting

parameters. This is shown by solid curves in Fig. 3. The excellent fits to Eq. 1 capture

both the depth and width near the Dirac charge neutrality points and justify the series

model of the graphene impedance with C arising from the total graphene area. For device
A(B), we extract BN ≈ 4 (4), vF ≈ 1.05 (0.95) × 106 m/s and nimp,1 ≈ 5 (7) × 1010 cm−2
and nimp,2 ≈ 1 (6) × 1010 cm−2. The low impurity carrier concentration is consistent with
transport measurements in graphene encapsulated with hBN31. In another symmetric device

C (see the supplementary material) with a different circuit and a different stack, the nimp is
found to be even lower ≈ 4×109 cm−2 and extracted Fermi velocity higher ≈ 1.54×106 m/s.
Such renormalization of vF due to electron-electron interactions at low doping has been

observed both in capacitance30 and transport measurements32–34 in homogeneously doped

graphene.

We now discuss the real part of the graphene impedance which relates to the dissipation

of the microwave resonance. The extracted R for two devices fabricated from the same

hBN-graphene-hBN stack (device A and B) is plotted in Fig. 4(a). Two peaks are visible

in the extracted resistances, which are similar to the charge neutrality points in transport

measurements. The positions of the peaks correspond to the minima of the extracted capaci-

tance. At large gate voltages where residual impurities play a negligible role, the resistances

start to saturate around similar values despite the fact that device A is twice as long as

device B. In the absence of contacts, this points to the direction that the resistance is dom-

inated by the p-n junction at high doping. A similar behaviour of R is seen in the device C

(see the supplementary material). Close to CNPs, the respective bulk graphene areas also

contribute significantly to the resistance. These features are in agreement with the carrier

density (n) dependence of the bulk and p-n junction conductivity in graphene. While the

conductivity for the p-n junction35 is proportional to n1/4, it scales as n or n1/2 for bulk

graphene depending on the relevant scattering mechanisms36.

The bulk carrier transport in graphene can be characterized by the diffusion constant D.

By knowing both R and CQ, D can be calculated from the Einstein relation

D = (L)2/(RCQ).

(5)

A complication in our devices arises due to the presence of p-n junction which is almost

always present. We can, therefore, only get an estimate of D by considering R and CQ,

that are largely arising from only one graphene area A1 or A2. For higher gate voltages,

the p-n junction resistance plays a role, whereas close to the CNPs, both areas contribute

to the resistance and the capacitance significantly. The inverse of the quantum capacitance,

obtained by subtracting the total geometric contribution CG from the total extracted C, is

now plotted against the simultaneously measured resistance R in Fig. 4(b). We have taken

the data points that are strictly on the left (negative VG) or the right side of CNPs (positive

VG). We extract D at a modest doping marked by the dashed line in Fig. 4(b). Since

one cannot separate the contribution of p-n resistance, by using the total R in Eq. 5, bulk

graphene resistance is overestimated and therefore D is underestimated. In graphene areas
A1 lying on signal plane (not changed after etching), we get D =0.19 (0.21) × 104 cm2/s for
device A(B). In contrast for area A2 lying on ground plane, we get 1.2 (0.32) × 104 cm2/s.
The large differences in D for area A2 between two devices is consistent with variations in

the impurity concentration extracted from fitting of the capacitance, and could result from

the additional etching step of the stack for device B. We furthermore estimate an average
mean free path of two areas lm = 2(cid:104)D(cid:105)/vF to yield 1.4 (0.5) µm for device A(B), which are
in reasonable agreement with values reported in transport measurements.

In summary, we have capacitively coupled encapsulated graphene devices to high quality

microwave resonators and observed clear changes in the resonance-linewidth and -frequency

as a response to change in the gate voltage. We are able to reliably extract geometrical

and quantum capacitance in good agreement with the density of states of graphene and

simple capacitance models, respectively. Moreover, the charge relaxation resistance can be

simultaneously inferred and the diffusion constant can be estimated. The results highlight

fast characterizations of graphene without requiring any contacts that could compromise the

device quality.

An uncertainty of the given measurements lies in the extracted R due to the loss constant

of the circuit which can vary from one cool down of the device to the next. From fitting

the reflectance response with a different α, we find that the extracted R at different circuit

losses are merely offset to each other however the extracted C is not affected. The behaviour

can be understood by replacing the loss constant with a resistor RLoss in series with the

graphene resistor R. The α could be accurately separated in quantum Hall regime, where

the conductance of the device is known. For this, due to the large B-fields copper res-

onators37 have to be fabricated. The ability of our circuit to measure quantum capacitance

and resistance in a contact-free way can for example be useful to study band modification of

graphene due to proximity spin orbit effects38 or due to Moire superlattices39. The method

can also be useful for other 2D materials, on which an ohmic contact is challenging to obtain.
