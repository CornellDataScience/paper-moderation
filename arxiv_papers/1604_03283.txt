ABSTRACT 

 

We  investigate  spin  polarized  electron  transport  in  ultra-thin  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  and  Ge-

Core/Si-Shell  nanowire  system  using  semi-classical  Monte  Carlo  simulation  method. 

Depolarization  of  electron's  spin  occurs  in  nanowire  mainly  due  to  D'yakonov-Perel 

dephasing  (DP-mechanism)  and  Elliott-Yafet  dephasing  (EY-mechanism).  We  studied  the 

dependence  of  spin  dephasing  on  ultra-thin  silicon  core  diameter  in  Si-Core/Ge-Shell 

nanowire  and  germanium  core  diameter  in  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire.  Variation  in  spin 

dephasing  length  with  varying  core  diameter  ranging  from  1  nm  to  9  nm  indicate  that  spin 

dephasing  length  increases  with  increase  in  Si-core  diameter  in  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  nanowire 

and  spin  dephasing  length  decreases  with  increase  in  Ge-core  diameter  in  Ge-Core/Si-Shell 

nanowire.  We  then  studied  the  variation  in  spin  dephasing  length  with  varying  externally 

applied  transverse  electric  field  ranging  from  20  kV/cm  to100  kV/cm.  In  the  electric  field 

dependence  study  we  found  that  spin  dephasing  length  is  weakly  dependent  upon  applied 

electric  field.  In  the  end,  we  studied  the  variation  in  spin  dephasing  length  with  varying 

temperature in the range of 4 K to 377 K. In this simulational study we found that for both Si-

Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire system spin dephasing length shows a strong 

dependence on temperature and spin dephasing length increases with decrease in temperature 

from room temperature range.

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

Spintronics has attracted a lot of research interest in the last decade with an aim to integrate 

magnetic materials and semiconductors. The motivation behind the spintronics technology is 

to use the spin of electrons as a tool to encode, store and transmit in an energy-efficient way 

digital  data  in  modern  electronics.  [1-3]  Spintronics  technology  based  on  semiconductor 

material can be used to integrate both logic processing, memory storage and communication 

device  on  a  single  chip.  [4,  5]  Hence,  spintronics  technology  provides  a  path  for 

multifunctional  devices  in  classical  sense.  Also,  spin  is  used  in  the  domain  of  quantum 

computation. [6] There are basically three basic phenomena in the spintronics technology, (1) 

at the source information is stored in spin state and then injected. This process is known as 

spin injection. (2) Information is carried by electrons which experience scattering and hence 

the  electron  spin  states  relax  along  the  channel.  This  is  the  method  of  spin  dephasing.  (3) 

Information  is  detected at the drain known as  spin  detection. [7, 8]An analysis  described in 

our  paper  focuses  on  spin  dephasing.  Implementation  of  spin-based  electronics  in  the 

mainstream  semiconductor  material  such  as  Silicon  (Si)  and  Germanium  (Ge)  is  important 

challenge  for  the  success  of  spintronics  technology.  [9-12]Other  than  conventional 

semiconductor nanowire structure, recently core-shell nanowire structure draws the attention 

of research community and offers larger carrier confinement due to their unique structure. 

In the core-shell nanowire system band engineered dimension and material creates the band 

offsets in the energy band diagram and carriers are confined in the core material and effect of 

surface  states  is  eliminated.  Hence,  effective  conductance  increases.  In  the  Ge-core/Si-shell 

nanowire structure due to band alignment hole confinement potential has larger value and in 

the Si-core/Ge-shell nanowire structure electrons and holes confinement potential has smaller 

value. [13] 

 

 

 

Another advantage of Ge-core/Si-shell nanowire structure is Ge-core has high intrinsic carrier 

mobilities and Si-shell can be used for chemical passivation of nanowire by oxidation process 

as  formation  of  SiO2  is  well  calibrated  process  in  semiconductor  technology  and  gives  a 

stable higher quality surface passivation when compared to Ge based oxides. Ge-core/Si-shell 

nanowire  channels  based  Field-effect  Transistor  (FETs)  has  shown  better  performance 

metrics  compared  to  single-element  material  e.g.  Ge,  Si  based  nanowire  FETs.  [14]  Ge-

core/Si-shell  nanowire  exhibits  significant  quantum  coherence  effects  accompanied  by  high 

hole  mobility  which  provide  an  excellent  one-dimensional  nanoscale  system.  [15,  16]  In 

core/shell  nanowire  structure  scattering  rates  are  reduced  as  electron  transport  is  restricted 

only  in  the  lateral  direction  and  hence  mean  free  path  of  carriers  is  several  hundred 

nanometers  at  room  temperature.  [17]  In  the  present  work  we  studied  spin  polarized 

electronic  transport  in  ultra-thin  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  and  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire  system 

using  a  semi-classical  Monte  Carlo  simulation  approach.  The  effect  of  different  parameter 

(total core–shell diameter, core diameter, electric field, temperature) on spin dephasing length 

is  investigated.  For  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  and  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire  structure  we  perform 

simulation  for  the  electric  field  in  the  ranges  from  20  kV/cm  to  100  kV/cm  and  the 

temperature  ranges  from  4  K  to  373  K.  Previously  our  group  has  studied  spin  relaxation 

under  the  influence  of  varying  electric  field  and  temperature  in  Silicon  and  Germanium 

nanowires.  [18,  19]  We  also  studied  influence  of  variation  of  Germanium  mole  fraction  on 

spin  relaxation length in Silicon  Germanium (Si1-xGex) and III-V group nanowires. [20, 21] 

In  the  rest  of  the  paper  spin  polarized  transport  in  ultra-thin  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  and  Ge-

Core/Si-Shell nanowires have been investigated and to the best of our knowledge no Monte-

Carlo simulation work has been done in these very thin nanowires of up to few nanometers in 

diameter.  Recently  chemically  synthesized  Ge-core/Si-shell  nanowire  and  their  roughening 

and  dislocation-mediated  strain  relaxation  are  reported.  [14]  In  another  study  synthesis  of 

Core-Shell  Nano-needle  Arrays  of  Black  Ge  is  reported  by  Chuehet  al.[22]  In  Ge-Si 

nanowire  structure  through  magneto-transport  study  strong  tunable  spin-orbital  coupling  is 

investigated  [15,23]  In  Ge-core/Si-shell  nanowire  structure  helical  hole  states  and  strong 

spin-orbital  interaction  is  reported  by  Kloeffel  et  al.[24]  In  another  study  of  band  offset 

configurations  by  doping  in  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  nanowire,  Amato  et  al.[25]  show  band  offset 

variation  in  core-shell  structure  and  experimental  work  has  been  done  in  Ge-core/Si-shell 

nanowire qubits for hole spin relaxation by Yongjie et al.[26] These studies show that core-

shell nanowire structure is strong contender for future spintronics devices. 

 

II.   MODEL 

 

Jacoboni et al. first present Monte-Carlo simulation model for charge transport [27] and then 

spin  transport  in  a  quantum  wire  is  studied  by  Pramanik  et  al.  using  a  semi-classical 

approach. [28] Later Saikin et al. utilize kinetic transport equation, drift-diffusion and Monte-

Carlo  simulation  approaches  to  summarize  spin  dynamics  and  transport  in  semiconductor 

structures.  [29]  Monte  Carlo  simulation  approaches  are  extensively  used  for  transport  in 

nanowire  [30-32]  and  modeling  of  spin  FETs.  [33]  Recently  modeling  and  analysis  of  Si-

core/SiGe-shell  nanowire  has  been  done  by  Tang  et  al.  [34]  and  shows  greater  quantum 

mechanical effect and carrier confinement in core-shell structure compared to semiconductor 

alloy  nanowire. Hence  core-shell structure shows promising thermoelectric-related transport 

property.  In  this  article,  we  take  core-shell  structure  with  silicon  as  core  material  in  Si-

Core/Ge-Shell  nanowire,  germanium  as  core  material  in  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire  and 

studied spin transport property by using semi-classical Monte-Carlo simulation. In the present 

article  we  only  discuss  key  modification  and  necessary  feature  of  Monte-Carlo  simulation. 

For simplicity we approximate the cross section of core-shell nanowire as square as shown in 

Fig.1.The coordinate system is chosen where X is along the length of the core-shell structure, 

Y is along the width of the core-shell structure and Z is along the thickness of the core-shell 

structure.  In  the  1-D  system  electrons  are  restricted  in  the  Y  direction  and  the  Z  direction. 

Both  the  materials  e.g.  Silicon  and  Germanium  possess  bulk  inversion  symmetry.  [35,  36] 

Hence, bulk inversion asymmetry or Dresselhaus spin-orbital interaction is absent in both Si 

and Ge. Therefore Dresselhaus spin-orbital interaction is also absent in Si-Core/Ge-Shell and 

Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire  system.  The  transverse  electric  field  which  breaks  structural 

inversion asymmetry results in Rasbha spin orbit interaction. Spin polarization hence occurs 

in  core-shell  system  along  the  channel  due  to  Rasbha  spin  orbit  coupling  via  D'yakonov-

Perel (DP) relaxation. [37, 38]

Precession vector   ⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗    has only Rasbha component which is given by

Where      is the spin orbit splitting,   is electron charge, ⃗⃗is transverse electric field,  is the 
band gap and    is effective mass of electron. 

Using Eq. (2) in Eq. (1), with spin vector   ⃗⃗⃗⃗expressed as 

 ⃗      ⃗      ⃗      ⃗                                                           

We get components of spin vector  ⃗⃗⃗, expressed as 

  ⃗ 
  

   

 
 

     ⃗

considered      .The non-parabolicity approximation of the band is accounted by following 

energy-wave vector relation: [41] 

                                            

    
                                                                

 

Where  , is a non-parabolicity parameter and is given by the following expression,

We have assumed that phonons of core region are confined in core and similar assumption is 

considered  for  shell  region  also.  In  our  simulation,  we  have  considered  surface  roughness 

scattering,  optical  phonon  scattering,  spin  flip  scattering,  ionized  impurity  scattering  and 

acoustic phonon scattering mechanism. [42-46] 

 

III. SIMULATION FRAME WORK  

 

Spin polarized electronic transport in the core/shell nanowire structure is simulated based on 

models  described  in  the  section  II.  The  total  core-shell  nanowire  system  cross  section  area 

is10  nm   10  nm  and  length  is  10  um.  In  the  core/shell  nanowire  structure  we  applied 

transverse  electric  field  of  100  kV/cm  and  this  effective  electric  field  is  responsible  for 

Rasbha spin orbit coupling as it acts as symmetry breaking field. In our model we have taken 

four  lower  valleys  and  the  energy  levels  of  subbands  are  calculated  by  method  of  finite 

differences.[45] Reasonable value of driving electric field is chosen to restrict the majority of 

electrons  in  four  subbands.  The  cross-sectional  dimensions  of  the  nanowire  are  also 

considerably small, such that the higher subbands will be at high energy levels and thus can 

be safely considered to be unpopulated. 

The  material parameters for  Si and  Ge are taken from Jacoboni et al. [27] and  are  given in

The simulations are run for 1 million time steps with time steps of 0.2 femto-seconds so that 

electrons will reach their steady state condition. Data is recorded for last 50,000 steps and for 

all  the  components  of  spin  vector  ⃗⃗⃗    ⃗      ⃗  ensemble  average  is  computed  according  to 
the following expression, [47]

Spin  dephasing  length  is  expressed  by  distance  travelled  by  electron  from  the  point  of 

injection  to  the  point  where   ⃗  falls  to  one  upon  exponential  times  of  its  initial  value  at 

injection  point.  Z-spin  polarized  electrons  are  injected  with  100%  initial  polarization  hence 

initial value of    ⃗         is one. 

 

IV. RESULTS 

 

A.  Variation  in  magnitude  of  ensemble  averaged  spin  vector     and  spin  dephasing  length 

variation with core diameter in Si-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire: 

Here we investigate the spin dephasing length for various core diameters with the total core-

shell diameter  fixed for transverse effective electric field  of 100kV/cm at room temperature 

(300K). From Figures 2-5, we show variation in magnitude of ensemble averaged spin vector 

with core diameter in Si-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire.

In  Figures  3  and  5,  we  show  the  variation  of  spin  dephasing  length  with  varying  core 

diameter  and  it  clearly  indicates  that  spin  dephasing  length  decreases  with  increase  in  Ge-

core  diameter  in  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire  and  spin  dephasing  length  increases  with 

increase  in  Si-core  diameter  in  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  nanowire.  Difference  primarily  lies  in 

different band profiles obtained by different material combinations in Core/shell structure and 

hence  carriers  are  confined  according  to  Core/shell  structure.  The  dimensions  of  the  core-

shell  nanowire  system  govern  the  quantum  confinement  effects.  The  thickness  of  core  and 

shell  region  is  critical  in  determination  of  band  structure  and  subband  energy  levels.  In  our 

Si-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell system there is a band offset at the interface between 

core and shell as shown in the Figure 6. When band-gap of core region is smaller than that of 

shell region, core acts as a potential well. When the core diameter is very small, the effect of 

quantum confinement is more significant. The energy of carriers confined in the core region 

becomes very high.

The  subband  energy  levels  exceed  the  band  offset  at  interface.  Most  of  the  carriers  have 

higher probability of being found in shell region. However, as we increase the core diameter 

keeping  total  nanowire  diameter  constant,  the  subband  energy  levels  get  lowered  due  to 

reduced  quantum  confinement  effects.  In  this  case,  most  of  the  carriers  are  confined  to  the 

core region. This is reflected in Figures 3 to 5 showing the variation of spin dephasing length 

with core diameter. In our simulations, we observed that for value of core diameter of 1 nm, 

in  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire  almost  all  carriers  were  confined  to  shell  region.  Shell  is 

composed  of  Silicon  which  exhibits  higher  spin  dephasing  length  than  Germanium  and  so 

spin dephasing length is high for these values of core diameter and as core diameter increases 

from this value confinement is reduced and carriers start distributing in core region and spin 

dephasing length decreases. For core diameters above 3 nm, spin dephasing length decreases 

by 80% and most of the carriers were trapped in the core region. Core region is composed of 

Germanium which exhibits lower spin dephasing length compared to Silicon and so the spin 

dephasing length is quite low in that region. On the other hand in Si-Core/Ge-Shell nanowire 

increment in Si-Core diameter increases the spin dephasing length as more and more carriers 

are confined in Si-Core regions and silicon has high value of spin dephasing length compared 

to  germanium.  Above  8  nm  of  Si-Core  diameter  almost  all  the  carriers  are  confined  in  Si-

Core region and this gives rise to higher spin dephasing length. Whereas for the intermediate 

values, it was observed that the distribution of carriers was a bit more uniform and the value 

of spin dephasing length is in mid-range.

B.  Variation  in  magnitude  of  ensemble  averaged  spin  vector     and  spin  dephasing  length 

variation with applied electric field in Si-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire: 

 

Figures 7-10 show the variation in magnitude of ensemble averaged spin vector     and Spin 

dephasing  length  variation  with  applied  electric  field  in  core  diameter  of  4  nm  for  Si-

Core/Ge-Shell  and  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire.  We  observed  that  spin  dephasing  length 

depends weakly on electric field and the variation in itself is non-monotonic in nature. When 

increment  in  drift  velocity  dominates  the  increase  in  scattering  rates,  the  spin  penetrates 

deeper  in  the  channel,  giving  us  higher  values  of  spin  dephasing  lengths.  However,  when 

scattering  rates  dominate  drift  velocity,  spin  dephasing  is  faster.  The  overall  effect  is 

governed  by  the  prevailing  effect  of  the  scattering  rate  and  drift  velocity.  Scattering  rates 

saturate  at  higher  field  value.  It  remains  nearly  constant  with  only  slight  variation.  Driving 

electric fields are selected so that drift velocity does not get saturated. Thus in high electric 

field region spin dephases slower due to dominance of drift velocity over scattering rates.

C.  Variation  in  magnitude  of  ensemble  averaged  spin  vector     and  Spin  dephasing  length 

variation with Temperature in Si-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire: 

 

Acoustic phonon scattering for Si-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire depends on 

temperature  as  shown  in  equation  10.  Increase  in  temperature  causes  increase  in  acoustic 

phonon scattering which results in randomization of  k and   . As a result dephasing occurs 

more quickly and therefore spin dephasing length decreases with increase in temperature.

Figures 11-14 show the variation in magnitude of ensemble averaged spin vector    and spin 

dephasing length variation with Temperature for core diameter of 4nm at applied transverse 

electric  field  of  100  kV/cm.  It  clearly  shows  that  the  spin  dephasing  length  decreases 

monotonically with increase in temperature. 

 

V. CONCULSION 

 

In  this  article,  we  studied  spin  polarized  electronic  transport  in  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  and  Ge-

Core/Si-Shell  nanowire.  Our  study  revealed  that  spin  dephasing  length  depends  on 

germanium  core  diameter  in  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  and  on  silicon  core  diameter  in  Si-Core/Ge-

Shell nanowire structure. We found that spin dephasing length increases with increase in Si-

core  diameter  in  Si-Core/Ge-Shell  nanowire  and  spin  dephasing  length  decreases  with 

increase  in  Ge-core  diameter  in  Ge-Core/Si-Shell  nanowire.  Effect  of  temperature  on  spin 

dephasing  length  is  also  investigated  for  core  diameter  of  4  nm.  We  found  that  Spin 

dephasing  length  is  strongly  dependent  on  temperature  and  it  decreases  monotonically  with 

increase  in  temperature.  Finally,  we  studied  the  variation  in  spin  dephasing  length  with 

varying externally applied transverse electric field ranging from 20 kV/cm to100 kV/cm. In 

the electric field dependence study we found that spin dephasing length is weakly dependent 

upon applied electric field in Si-Core/Ge-Shell and Ge-Core/Si-Shell nanowire structure.
