The electrons forming a Cooper pair in a superconductor can be spatially separated preserving
their spin entanglement by means of quantum dots coupled to both the superconductor and inde-
pendent normal leads. We investigate the thermoelectric properties of such a Cooper pair splitter
and demonstrate that cooling of a reservoir is an indication of non-local correlations induced by
the entangled electron pairs. Moreover, we show that the device can be operated as a non-local
thermoelectric heat engine. Both as a refrigerator and as a heat engine, the Cooper pair splitter
reaches efficiencies close to the thermodynamic bounds. As such, our work introduces an experi-
mentally accessible heat engine and a refrigerator driven by entangled electron pairs in which the
role of quantum correlations can be tested.

Introduction. --  Hybrid nanostructures with supercon-
ducting or normal electrodes connected by quantum wires
provide a unique playground to test the interplay be-
tween transport and electron correlations1. Among these
types of devices, Cooper pair splitters have received spe-
cial attention due to their potential use as a source of
non-locally entangled electron pairs2 -- 4. A typical device
consists of a central superconducting lead coupled to two
normal ones through quantum dots, a geometry which
has been successfully implemented using semiconducting
nanowires5 -- 8, carbon nanotubes9,10 or graphene11.
In
this setup the Coulomb repulsion in the quantum dots
forces the incoming electron pairs from the superconduc-
tor to separate into different normal electrodes, while lo-
cal Andreev processes in which the two electrons from the
pair are transferred to the same normal lead are strongly
suppressed2. The Cooper pair splitting (CPS) process
can be viewed as the time reverse of a crossed Andreev
reflection in which an incoming electron from a given nor-
mal lead is reflected as a hole in the opposite lead12,13.
Positive correlation between the currents through the two
normal contacts has been presented as a signature of the
splitting process5,9,10.

Conventional transport measurements, including noise
correlations14 -- 16, could allow for a complete characteriza-
tion of the underlying microscopic processes17 and, even-
tually, entanglement detection18. However, the thermal
properties of Cooper pair splitters provide another per-
spective to the problem which still needs to be explored,
with the exception of thermoelectrically induced CPS19.
While these setups could have their own interest as mul-
titerminal thermoelectric devices20, in which the separa-
tion of heat and charge currents could be achieved21,22,
we rather focus on the thermoelectric properties which
may appear as signatures of the presence of Cooper pair
splitting. We show that, by virtue of these quantum
correlated processes, heat can flow from a cold normal
lead to a hotter one. This mechanism is different from

that used in systems based on Peltier cooling23 or heat
drag24, and from absorption refrigerators25 -- 28 or heat
pumps29,30, since no voltage bias is applied between the
two leads, and energy is conserved.

The basic idea is illustrated in Fig. 1. There are two
elementary processes which contribute to transport when
bias voltage and temperatures are much smaller than the
dot charging energies and the superconducting gap: the
already described CPS processes [Fig. 1(a)] and elastic
cotunneling (EC) processes in which an electron is trans-
ferred between the normal leads without changing the
charge of the superconductor [Fig. 1(b)]. Let us consider
the situation depicted in Fig. 1(c) in which the left elec-
trode temperature is larger than the right one (TL>TR)
but their chemical potentials are equal and below the
chemical potential of the superconductor (µS>µL=µR).
if the dot levels εL,R are tuned to be opposite
Then,
and εR<µR, the CPS processes inject electrons below the
Fermi energy in the right lead (and over it in the left one),
hence contributing to cooling the right and heating the
left lead. As we discuss in detail below, although EC
tends to destroy this effect, it remains robust for a broad
range of parameters. Therefore, our proposal should be

Model. --  We consider a quantum dot based Cooper
pair splitter: two quantum dots serve as the links between
a superconductor and two normal leads, as sketched in
Fig. 1. We assume that the superconducting gap ∆ and
local Coulomb interactions U0 are large so that double
occupancy of a single dot can be neglected (typical ex-
periments5 -- 7,10 are performed at T ∼ 20 − 50 mK, with
∆ ∼ 100−200 µeV and U0 > 1 meV). Thus our model
Hamiltonian of the system can be written as

leads can be incorporated to lowest order in perturbation
theory. This is characterized by tunneling rates ΓL/R (cid:28)

Note that within our approximations, the evolution of the

from the populations pi in the eigenstate basis. A crucial
aspect in this device is that the coupling to the super-
conductor injects particles but conserves energy in the
normal subsystem, i.e., IL + IR (cid:54)= 0 and
(IlVl + Jl) = 0.

Only when τCPS = 0 do we have IL + IR = 0.

CPS cooling. --  We now demonstrate the cooling ef-
fect of CPS processes with a simple configuration that
can be described analytically. We consider the case with
antisymmetric energy levels ε ≡ εL = −εR where CPS
is most effective. For simplicity, we first restrict to the
situation with τEC = 0, where the odd states do not hy-
bridize. In the region with ε (cid:29) τCPS (cid:29) kBTL ≥ kBTR
and eVL = eVR = eV < 0, transport is dominated by the
states e,−(cid:105) and 0, σ(cid:105). This is the configuration sketched
in Fig. 1(c) and marked by a green arrow in Fig. 2(a). The
opposite configuration with ε < 0, eV > 0 can be treated
equivalently. Only two transitions (and their reversed)
are hence relevant: starting from the doubly occupied
state, one electron can tunnel to the left lead with a rate
(ΓL/4)[1− fL(x+)], and the remaining one tunnels to the
right one with rate (ΓR/2)[1 − fR(x−)]. For the reversed
transitions, one has to replace 1−f (x±)→f (x±). Here
U 2+4τCPS2−U . Then,
x± = Ωe−−ε±eV and 2Ωe− ≡
the initial state is restored by the splitting of a Cooper
pair. Solving the master equation for the occupation of
these two states, one arrives at the heat currents

JR = x−

(10)

and JL = −(x+/x−)JR. Note that transitions in the
left and right barriers occur at different energies split by
x+ − x− = 2eV . For Ωe−−ε < eV < ε−Ωe−, heat is
extracted from the right terminal (JR>0) and is absorbed
by the left one (JL<0). Hence, if TL>TR, heat flows from
the cold to the hot terminal in this regime. Such a CPS-
assisted cooling effect is different from other quantum
dot based refrigerators that exploit a voltage gradient
between the two terminals or the energy exchange with
an additional thermal bath28,39.

One can also easily check that the charge currents fulfill
IL = IR = (e/x−)JR. They have the same sign, as ex-
pected for CPS processes. The proportionality between
Il and Jl achieves a tight-coupling limit, at which ther-
moelectric processes attain high efficiencies40, as will be
discussed later.

The behaviour of the heat current JR as a function of
the different parameters is illustrated in Figs. 2(a) -- (e).

3

There the dot chemical potentials are dominated by the
coherent hybridization due to τCPS, see Eq. (3). The pos-
itive eV induces the absorption of two electrons from the
left and right leads and their recombination as a Cooper
pair, mainly through the sequence e,−(cid:105) → 0σ(cid:105) → e,−(cid:105).
In the first transition, an amount of heat x− is extracted
from the right terminal. Then, −x+ is absorbed by the
left one as heat. Hence, cooling is driven by a purely
quantum mechanical process in this regime. Contrary to
the previous case, this regime is more sensitive to EC and
JR becomes negative as α exceeds 0.5, cf. Figs. 2(b) and
(c).

Note also that for eV > 0 and ε ≈ 0 heat currents are
suppressed due to the occupation of the triplet states,
which leads to a spin blockade31 of heat currents.

Comparison to a incoherent setup. --  To emphasize the
essential role of quantum correlations, it is useful to com-
pare our case with a similar system of two indepen-
dent quantum dots coupled to a fictitious third normal
electronic reservoir, C, whose temperature TC adapts to
the condition of no energy injection into the system41,
cf. Eq. (9). Such a geometry has been previously in-
vestigated for cryogenic purposes43 -- 45. For simplicity,
let us assume U =0 and ε = εL = −εR, and that all
tunneling rates are equal and given by γ. Then, cool-
ing occurs in the regions with eV < −ε where J∗R =
(ε + eV )γ[fR(ε + eV )− fL(ε− eV )]/4, see Fig. 2(f). How-
ever, cooling in this setup is only possible due to an addi-
tional condition, namely that C must become the hottest
reservoir: TC ≥ TL ≥ TR. Furthermore, TC depends on
the voltage and level configuration to satisfy Eq. (9). In
a realistic configuration with a well defined TC, cooling
under these conditions is only possible for particular con-
figurations  -- an example is marked with dotted lines in
Fig. 2(d). In contrast, in the coherent case CPS warrants
energy conservation for every configuration. Note also by
comparing Figs. 2(a) and (d), that in the coherent case
cooling is achieved for regions with ε and eV having the
same sign (for ε < Ωe−, region (cid:46)), something that is
not possible in the system with no quantum correlations.
The role of spin correlations is also evident in the absence
of a spin blockade in the incoherent case, leading to the
electron-hole symmetric Fig. 2(f).

Heat engine. --  As the two dots are not directly cou-
pled, the superconductor also mediates a non-local ther-
moelectric effect. A charge current flows in one terminal
by increasing the temperature of the other one19. The
non-conservation of charge due to CPS strongly influ-
ences the system response. For instance, if τEC=0, the
same number of electrons are injected in both leads, so
no thermovoltage will develop between them. We study
two relevant configurations to operate the Cooper pair
splitter as a heat engine, assuming terminal L is hot,
TL = TR + ∆T : (i) short circuit, where L is grounded
(VL=0), and (ii) open circuit, where L acts as a voltage
probe, i.e., a floating VL develops such that it injects heat
but not charge (IL = 0).

Let us first consider the short circuit configuration (i).
Transport strongly depends on whether CPS or EC pro-

and applied bias voltage V = VL = VR. Cooling occurs in

2 µeV, τEC = 0, and ∆T = 0 except when explicitly stated.
(f) Heat current for the incoherent setup with two quantum
dots coupled to a thermal reservoir whose temperature TC
adapts to fulfill Eq. (9), with γ = Γ/3. Dotted lines mark the
configurations with cooling at a fixed TC = 5T /4.

Let us concentrate on the case with ε > 0 (the opposite
case can be understood with similar arguments). We can
distinguish two regions where cooling occurs, [marked by
(cid:46) and ◦ in Fig. 2(a)] depending on the relative value of ε
and Ωe−. The case for ε > Ωe−, eV < 0 ((cid:46)) can be under-
stood in terms of the analytical model presented above.
In this regime, the energy of the odd states dominates
the heat currents, so CPS cooling is robust against the
contribution of EC processes.
It also survives for rela-
tively high temperature gradients, cf. Figs. 2(d) and (e).
Although the magnitude of the cooling power can be en-
hanced by increasing the base temperature, we have cho-
sen to illustrate the effect using conservative parameters
that warrant the validity of our simplified description.

The case for the region ε < Ωe−, eV > 0 (◦) is different.

cesses dominate, as it is shown in Fig. 3. The case
with dominant EC exhibits a typical double quantum
dot response42, where transport in the center of the sta-
bility diagram is dominated by interdot tunneling, cf.
Fig. 3(a). The current shows a characteristic double oscil-
lation around the points where the number of particles of
the double dot changes as εL = εR increases, see Fig. 3(d).
Differently, the case with dominant CPS exhibits an
inverted stability diagram, where the largest oscillations
occur along the condition εL = −εR, see Figs. 3(c,f).
For this condition, the two current oscillations result
from transitions between e,−(cid:105) and the corresponding
odd state o, σ,±(cid:105) ≈ σ, 0(cid:105),0, σ(cid:105).
Available experiments suggest that both CPS and EC
contributions might be of the same order5 -- 7,9 -- 11, which
gives a mixed thermoelectric effect, cf. Fig. 3(b). This
is relevant for the open circuit configuration (ii). As dis-
cussed above, if τEC=0 or τCPS=0 we have IR=±IL. In
both cases the system delivers no power, since we im-
pose IL=0 and hence also IR=0. Consequently, the opti-
mal configuration for an open circuit engine requires that
both EC and CPS contributions are finite and of the same
order, see below.

Efficiencies. --  We now discuss the performance of the
system as a refrigerator and as a heat engine. This is
done in terms of the cooling coefficient of performance
COP = JR/P for the refrigerator, and of the thermo-
electric efficiency η = −P /JR, for the heat engine, where
l IlVl is the power. By thermodynamic consider-
ations, one can show that both parameters are bounded
by COP0 = TR/∆T and ηC = 1 − TR/TL, respectively.
For cooling, the COP gets arbitrarily close to the opti-
mal value when only CPS contributes, independently of
the temperature gradient, as shown in Fig. 4(a). A finite
∆T also increases the voltage at which the optimal per-
formance is obtained. Note that COP diverges for ∆T =0.

gine configurations, with different relative contribution of the
EC and CPS processes, α=τEC/τCPS. (a) Coefficient of per-
formance at different ∆T parametrized by the optimal COP0.
(b) Generated power and (c) efficiency for short circuit (VL=0)
and open circuit (IL=0) configurations, with ∆T =TR/4. Note
that no power is generated in open circuit for the case α=0.
All other parameters as in Fig. 2(d).

The cooling power is robust against the presence of EC
and/or a finite temperature gradient, cf. Figs. 2(d) and
(e), but the COP becomes lower, around 0.3COP0, when
τEC ≈ τCPS.
For the heat engine, we again distinguish the open and
short circuit configurations. In both cases, ILVL = 0, so
power is only finite in the right terminal. Short circuit-
ing the left terminal achieves the largest generated power
when CPS dominates, cf. Fig. 4(b).
In this configura-
tion, the engine furthermore works close to the Carnot
bound, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Both the power and the
efficiency decrease with increasing τEC, with η≈0.4ηC for
τEC ≈ τCPS.
As discussed above, the open circuit gives no power
(or very tiny) if only one microscopic process is present.
Interestingly though, when both processes have similar
contributions, τEC≈τCPS, the power and the efficiency
are better than at short circuit. In this case, the highest
efficiency coincides with the maximum power extraction.
Conclusions. --  We have analyzed the thermoelectric
properties of a Cooper pair splitter, identifying configu-
rations where the reversed heat current from a cold to
a hot reservoir with the same chemical potential is an
indication of correlations mediated by Cooper pair split-
ting. These microscopic processes also play a key role
in the dual operation of the system as a heat engine.
The Cooper pair splitter is thus an example of a tun-
able device that utilizes quantum correlations to perform
thermodynamic operations46 -- 51 with high efficiencies.

Finally,

let us mention that the predicted cooling
power, of the order of fractions of fW for experimentally
relevant configurations, is within the achieved resolution
in recent measurements of Coulomb blockaded heat cur-
rents44,52 -- 54.
