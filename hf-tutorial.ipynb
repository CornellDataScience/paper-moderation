    "- HuggingFace is an online platform with pre-trained models and datasets which is very popular in teh machine learning community.\n",
    "- Any ML model worth its weight (matrices) is usually submitted to HuggingFace for anyone to download and use out of the box\n",
    "- HuggingFace also has a very intuitive interface for creating datasets, and fine-tuning and running ML models (i.e. Pipelines)\n",
    "  - Much easier to learn than PyTorch (in my opinion)\n",
    "- Allows you to abstract away the details of model architectures, and experiment with different types of models\n",
    "- You can put it on your resume ;)"
