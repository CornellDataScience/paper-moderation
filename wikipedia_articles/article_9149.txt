The Xiang Army and Huai Army combined to become the Green Standard Army in 1862 and for the third time they surrounded and attacked Nanjing, successfully ending the civil war in July 1864.


== Commentary ==
The Jiangnan DaYing had trouble making payroll for its forces, and these forces were insufficient to fight against the British and French forces in northern China during the Second Opium War.
The leaders intrigued against each other: Xiang Rong (向榮) and Her Chyun in the first Jiangnan DaYing Her Chyun group, and the He Guiqing and Zeng Guofan groups disputed inner officials' system, which allowed the Taiping Rebellion to gain momentum.
Her Chyun could use the Brigadier General's works but he belittled the Taiping Rebellion, He Guiqing's cowardice and Zeng Guofan's selfishness, which were the three reasons for their loss.
