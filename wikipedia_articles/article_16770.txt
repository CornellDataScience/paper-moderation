Paranoid Visions are a punk rock band from Dublin, Ireland who formed in 1982. They broke up in 1992, had reunion shows and eventually decided to reunite.
The band ran their own label, F.O.A.D. (Fuck Off And Die), during the 1980s and 1990s. The label was based in Dublin and run by guitarist, P.J. as is the bulk of their current administration to date.
In 1987, the band started the FOAD2U2 campaign (meaning fuck off and die to U2). These letters could be seen sprayed all over Dublin at the time. Their EP, I Will Wallow is a parody of U2's album, Boy, and their single "I Will Follow". The band went on hiatus in the early 1990s reforming for shows in 1996 with the Sex Pistols on the Filthy Lucre Tour and The Damned on their 25th anniversary tour of 2001. In 2005, Toxic Records released the compilation album Outside In, resulting in the band reforming for a few shows in support of the release. The reformation led to a creative burst and resulted in the Missing in Action EP. The critical and commercial success of the record continued the creative vein and between 2005 and 2017 the band released five new albums and 12 singles. The January 2009 release Beware of the God. was voted number 107 in the list of the most important Irish albums in Hot Press magazine, whilst the singles "Politician", "Treasure on the Wasteland" and "Outsider Artist" (featuring TV Smith) all hit the Irish top 10.
In 2013, the band formed an unlikely alliance with Crass vocalist Steve Ignorant, which started out life as a single track and led on to regular live performances, two albums and two singles. The band alongside Ignorant have played some of the biggest alternative festivals in the world including Chicago's Riot Fest, Canada's Amnesia Festival and the annual appearance at the UK's Rebellion Festival. At the latter, the band performed a set featuring Crass songs for the first time in seven years, alongside tracks by Flux of Pink Indians, Poison Girls, DIRT and Conflict, as well as their own material. The 2016 album, Now and Then...! featuring Steve Ignorant, entered the Irish charts at number 6.
