== History ==

The city is named after Har Sahai (1725 – 1750), who was the direct descendant of the fourth Sikh guru, the Guru Ram Das, in the eighth generation. The Pothimala building was built in 1705 and the locality of Guru Har Sahai was founded in 1745 by Har Sahai's father, Guru Jiwan Mal (born 1694), who was a direct descendant of the fourth Sikh guru, Ram Das, in the seventh generation. Guru Har Sahai was also the eighth Gaddi Nashin (custodian) of the pothimala, i.e. pothi (holy book) and mala (rosary), of the first guru of the Sikhs – Guru Nanak Dev. The lineage descends from Prithi Chand, elder brother of Guru Arjan and founder of the heretical Miharvan sect of Sikhism. The Sodhi clan of Sikhs consider hereditary appointed direct descendants of fourth Sikh guru, Ram Das Sodhi, as their guru or spiritual leader, whom they refer to as Gaddi Nashin. In 2010, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) begin the effort to restore the pothimala, the Pothimala building (including its 18th century murals), both of which are the property of the present Gaddi Nashin, 17th successor custodian Guru Yuvraj Singh.

The Hargopal subsect of the Meharban sect of Sikhism is based out of Pothimala in Guru Har Sahai. They maintain a following to this day amongst the locals and remain held in reverence, being direct descendants of the Sikh gurus and custodian of rare Sikh relics of the gurus.
