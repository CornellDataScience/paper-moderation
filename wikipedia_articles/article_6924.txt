The Tour of Missouri was a professional road bicycle racing stage race in Missouri that started on September 11, 2007 with six days of racing. The organizers, who also run the Tour de Georgia and the Amgen Tour of California, billed it as the third highest profile race in the United States.
The 2009 Tour of Missouri took place September 7â€“13, 2009 as part of 2008-2009 UCI America Tour and the 2009 USA Cycling Professional Tour.  Missouri state officials intended to support the Tour for three years, with the intention of making it an annual event. However, the 2009 Tour was almost canceled when its funds were provisionally cut from the state's tourism budget. Funds were restored when breach-of-contract fees to teams threatened to total more than the $1.5 million that it would cost the state to finance the race.
