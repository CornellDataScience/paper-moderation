The city of Kivlovodsk was formed in 1803 as a military fort to protect visitors to the medicinal springs, and the park itself was begun in 1827 when soldiers planted a promenade of Linden trees.  The urban park was elevated to the status of national park in 2016, with the objectives of preserving the natural environment, preserving historical and cultural sites, providing for environmental education, and regulating tourism and recreation.

As an urban park, the emphasis is on broad public spaces (promenades, gazebos, gardens), long walking paths, and scenic observation decks on the hilltops.  The lower park, in town, features a visitor center with museum and nature exhibits, and a "drinking gallery" where visitors can sample three different types of mineral waters.  The middle park features exercise facilities, hiking paths, and memorial gardens.  The upper park features a cable car, and hiking trails to various hilltop observation decks.  There are cafes and restaurants in the park, and hotels in the surrounding town.
