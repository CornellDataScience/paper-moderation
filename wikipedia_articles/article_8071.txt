== History ==
The private Kyushu Railway, in building a line to Nagasaki, had opened a track southwards from Tosu to Saga and Takeo (today Takeo-Onsen) by 1895. By 1897, the track had reached Haiki. In the next phase of expansion, the track was extended towards Ōmura which opened as the new terminus on 20 January 1898. Sonogi was opened on the same day as an intermediate station between Haiki and Ōmura. When the Kyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1907, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. On 12 October 1909, track from Tosu through Haiki to Nagasaki was designated the Nagasaki Main Line. On 1 December 1934, another route was given the designation Nagasaki Main Line and the track from Haiki, through Sonogi to Isahaya was designated the Ōmura Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu.
