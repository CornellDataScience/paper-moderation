The Haima Freema (普力马) is a Compact MPV car that is manufactured by the Chinese manufacturer Haima. Its first generation ran from 2004 to 2011 and second generation ran from 2011 to 2014.
Haima was founded in the 1990s as Hainan Mazda Motor, a joint venture partnership between the Chinese province of Hainan and Mazda that aimed to build Mazdas in China for the local market. In that composition, the company continued to exist until the early 2000s, when the Chinese FAW Group took over Mazda's 49 percent share of the company and formed Haima. However, this has no effect to Haima continuing to use dated Mazda platforms and technology, which led to the first generation Haima Freema model being sold as a rebadge of the Mazda Premacy and the second generation Freema model still utilizing the same platform.
Haima converted 12 copies of the first generation Freema into electric vehicles as part of a field test, and later launched the Freema EV in 2011. Production continued after the second generation gasoline-powered Freema was discontinued.


== First generation (2004–2011) ==

The first generation Haima Freema is essentially a rebadged first generation Mazda Premacy.
The Freema model sold between 2004 and 2011 only has one source of power on the specifications options, a 1.8 liter engine that produces 122 hp powering the front wheels via a five-speed manual transmission.


== Second generation (2011–2014) ==

Based on the same structure as the first generation Freema, the second generation Freema debuted in 2011 with prices starting at 83,800 yuan and ending at 109,800 yuan. The second generation Freema is powered by engines including a 120 hp 1.6 liter gasoline engine and a 122 hp 1.8 liter gasoline engine, both engines mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox or a CVT.
Dimension wise, the second generation Haima Freema was given an extended wheelbase extended from the standard first generation Freema and Mazda Premacy. The extended longer wheelbase made it possible for Haima to offer the second generation Freema as an optional seven-seater.
