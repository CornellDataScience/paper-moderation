== Early life and education ==
Perdpiriyawong was born in Lat Krabang district, Bangkok, and is of Chinese descent. Due to their parents' jobs, he and his older brother grew up with their grandparents.

== Career ==
Perdpiriyawong was first contacted through Facebook by a manager who asked him if he wanted to work in the entertainment industry. Although he had never been interested in it, he asked his parents for advice and decided to give it a try. When a subsequent acting project fell through, he signed with Domundi and starred in the reality-variety show DMD Reality in 2021. He debuted in 2022 in Cutie Pie, playing Kuea Keerati opposite Pruk Panich: the success of the BL romance series shot him to stardom overnight, both in Thailand and abroad, and Howe Magazine included him in the list of the 50 most influential people of the year. He reprised his role in 2023 both in the sequel Cutie Pie 2 You and the spin-off Naughty Babe. In the meantime, Perdpiriyawong starred in the series Mission Fan-Possible and the movie After Sundown.
Aside from acting, Perdpiriyawong pursued a singing career: after lending his voice to the soundtrack of Cutie Pie, in September 2022 he sang "True Love" for the Thai series To Sir, With Love, writing the Chinese lyrics. For his 21st birthday, he held the NuNew Magic Day fanmeet/concert, performing in front of 3,000 fans. In July 2023, he released his first single titled "Anything", ranking 12th on the Billboard Global's World Digital Song Sales Chart. On September 30 and October 1, 2023, Perdpiriyawong and Pruk Panich held a sold-out joint concert at Thunder Dome, Muang Thong Thani: both shows were followed by 4,000 people onsite and over 15,000 online. On November 4 and 5, he performed at Peck-Aof-Ice InFriendnity Concert as a special guest.
In 2024, he released several singles, including international collaborations like "Blooming Just For You" with South Korean singer Paul Kim and the theme song for Nippon Haku Bangkok festival, "Dream 2024 (Paint the Future)", with Kokoro Kohatsu from the Japanese band Psychic Fever from Exile Tribe. On August 10 and 11, he held his first concert titled Dream Catcher at the Impact Arena, Muang Thong Thani, selling out more than 20,000 tickets for both days.
On November 20, 2024 he released his first Japanese solo single, "First Date at Shibuya", under Sony Music Entertainment Japan, which was followed by a concert on December 6. The single debuted at #15 on the Oricon Daily Singles Chart of December 3, rising to #5 the next day.
