== Club career ==


=== Early career ===
Bahebeck was born in the commune of Saint-Denis in the Île-de-France region. He is the younger brother of Red Star Saint-Ouen midfielder Rosère Manguélé. Manguélé previously played professionally with Châteauroux. Bahebeck began his football career in September 2000 at the age of seven playing for local club Club Sportif Municipal de Persan in the Val d'Oise commune of Persan. He spent almost three years training at the club before signing his first license with nearby club Union Sportive Persan in October 2003. While training at Persan, Bahebeck was supervised by club coach Denis Diaz.
In 2006, while playing with Persan, Bahebeck was spotted by Paris Saint-Germain officials who offered him a trial at the club. While attending the club's detection camp, he participated in a local tournament held in Sens that was composed of professional teams and responded by scoring "four or five goals" in the competition. Despite the performance, Bahebeck remained at Persan after it was suggested by his club coaches that he remain in the Val d'Oise department to be with his family and his team for at least one more year. He was later enticed by both Marseille and Bordeaux, but remained keen on joining Paris Saint-Germain stating it was his preference.

Bahebeck began his Paris Saint-Germain career in the club's youth academy at the Camp des Loges. He was placed on the club's under-14 team and immediately developed a reputation of a serial goalscorer.

From October to January, he scored five goals in seven appearances, which included both goals in a 2–1 victory over the reserve team of Nancy and the game-winning goal in a win over Jura Sud. As a result of his performances during the campaign, Bahebeck was linked with moves to English clubs Manchester City and Chelsea who sought to acquire the player on a free transfer as he did not have a professional contract at the time.
For his performances with the reserve team, Bahebeck was also rewarded with a call up to the club's senior team by Kombouaré and trained with the team during the winter break in Morocco.

He made his professional debut in the match appearing as a substitute late in the second half. The match eventually went into extra time drawn at 0–0 and, in the 108th minute, Bahebeck scored the game-winning goal in a 2–0 victory. Following the season, on 23 June 2011, Bahebeck signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Paris Saint-Germain.
