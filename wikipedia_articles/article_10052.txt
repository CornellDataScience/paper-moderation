Sha la la Summer Time (Sha la laâ˜†Summer Time) is the 17th single of Japanese boy band Kis-My-Ft2, released on August 24, 2016.
This is their 17th single and is a bright summer song, a commercial song for Kowa "Unakowa", and "Dream  Stage" on the regular disc is the theme song for Fuji TV's "Moshi Mo Tours". Each of the three formats also includes duo or trio song as a coupling. The first limited edition A features songs by Hiromitsu Kitayama, Wataru Yokoo and Toshiya Miyata, the first limited edition B features Takashi Nikaido and Kento Senga, and the regular edition features Taisuke Fujigaya and Yuta Tamamori.
For the first time in the three and a half years since "Fate Girl," the music video is fully devoted to roller-skating action. The setting is a 1980's drivers' cafe where the band members stop by to play at the beach, and the stage is set in the image of a "late summer night".
In addition to the usual roller skating performance music video included on the first disc A, this is the first time Kis-My-Ft2 has attempted a "spin-off music video" to bring the summer to a close with a video. The stage is set at the "Kis-My Summer" launch site. A mysterious creature appears. The Last Scream that roll up to the members enjoying the show are also part of the fun.
During breaks in the long shoot, the members used the bar counter on the set and began an impromptu improvisational play between the bar's mom and the customers.
