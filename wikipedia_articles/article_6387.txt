In his first fight on the show, Graves faced Kamaru Usman. He lost the closely contested bout via majority decision.
In his second fight on the show, Graves faced off against Jason Jackson. After nearly being finished in the fight's opening moments (when he was dropped by a groin strike and subsequent follow up punches), he won the fight via submission in the first round.


=== Ultimate Fighting Championship ===
Graves made his official debut for the promotion on July 12, 2015, at The Ultimate Fighter 21 Finale where he faced fellow castmate Vicente Luque. He won the fight via unanimous decision.
Graves was expected to face Danny Roberts on December 10, 2015, at UFC Fight Night 80. However, Graves was forced out of the bout with an injury and replaced by Nathan Coy.
Graves next faced Randy Brown on April 16, 2016, at UFC on Fox 19. He won the fight via submission in the second round.
Graves next faced Bojan Veličković on July 30, 2016, at UFC 201. The bout was declared a majority draw (30-27, 28-28, 28-28).
Graves was expected to face Sérgio Moraes on November 19, 2016, at UFC Fight Night 100. However, Graves was removed from the fight on October 3 after he was arrested on a misdemeanor battery charge and was replaced by Zak Ottow. In turn, he was released from the promotion in April 2017.

After the brief stint in the Russian promotion, Graves signed with Titan FC again where he faced Gegg Ellis at Titan FC 51 on December 28, 2018. He won the fight via unanimous decision.
Next he faced Jared Gooden for the interim Titan Welterweight Championship at Titan FC 52 on March 15, 2019. Graves won the fight via unanimous decision, becoming the Titan FC interim Welterweight Champion as was subsequently promoted to undisputed Welterweight Champion as Uros Jurisic was stripped of the title.
Graves was expected to make his first title defense against Kamal Magomedov at Titan FC 57, but withdrew from the bout due to an injury. Magomedov fought Italo Goncalves for the interim Welterweight Championship instead and won the title via submission. Graves was scheduled to face Magomedov in a title unification bout at Titan FC 59 on February 28, 2020, but Magomed withdrew from the bout. Graves then headlined Titan FC 59 against Yuri Villefort. Graves successfully defended his title by knocking out Villefort in the fourth round.
Graves faced Oton Jasse at Titan FC 65 on November 22, 2020. At weigh-ins, Graves missed weight by 2 pounds and was therefore stripped of the title. He won the bout via guillotine choke in the first round.
In October 2021, news about Graves tweeting threats to mixed martial arts reporter Amy Kaplan and UFC president Dana White emerged. Simultaneously, Titan FC COO Lex McMahon revealed that Graves had not been under contract with the organization for a while.
