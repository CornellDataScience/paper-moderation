Follow Thru is a musical comedy with book by B. G. DeSylva and Laurence Schwab, lyrics by B. G. DeSylva and Lew Brown, and music by Ray Henderson.
Produced by Laurence Schwab and Frank Mandel, the Broadway production opened on January 9, 1929 at the Chanin's 46th St. Theatre and ran through December 21, 1929 for a total run of 401 performances. The show was directed by Edgar MacGregor, choreographed by Bobby Connolly, and used set designs by Donald Oenslager. The cast included Lilian Bond,  Jack Haley, Zelma O’Neal, John Barker and Eleanor Powell.
Called “a musical slice of country club life”, the plot involved a golf match at a country club. This was the first Broadway success for Eleanor Powell. The show produced several songs that are now standards, including “Button Up Your Overcoat”, “My Lucky Star”, and “I Want to be Bad”.
