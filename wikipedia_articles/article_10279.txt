Verbena, also known as Summerfield,  is an unincorporated community in southeastern Chilton County, Alabama, United States.  Named for the indigenous flower, Verbena developed into a popular resort location for the more affluent citizenry of Montgomery, the state's capital, during the yellow fever outbreaks of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Many stately homes, some of which have undergone recent renovation and restoration, line the streets of the town as a reminder of this historic past.
The town was built beside the railroad currently owned by CSX Transportation.  In its heyday, Verbena had two hotels, a bank, a post office, and a general store.  Many of those buildings are gone or boarded up today, but the Verbena United Methodist Church still stands on County Road 59 near the town's center.
According to the U.S. Census in 1890, Verbena showed a population of 756, making it the largest community in Chilton County at that time.
