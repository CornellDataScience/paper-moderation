In the 1980s and 1990s he drew many covers for Gladstone Publishing's Disney magazines.

== Biography ==
Daan Jippes started his comics career in the Netherlands, where his work was published in the comics magazine Pep in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He rose to national recognition with his comics album Bernard Voorzichtig: Twee Voor Thee. In the mid seventies he started working for the Dutch Donald Duck magazine, where his interpretation of the ducks and Mickey Mouse drew the attention of the Disney Studios in Burbank, California. Subsequently he was hired and worked for the Disney company; initially for the comic strip and merchandising department, later for the animation department as a designer and storyboarder, contributing to such films as The Rescuers Down Under, The Prince and the Pauper, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Aside from his work at Disney, he also worked as a storyboard supervisor on Amblimation's Balto and provided covers in Disney style for the comic books of Gladstone Publishing.
Back in the Netherlands, in 2006 Jippes started a new album series, based on the detective stories by Havank, drawn in a Marcinelle style similar to Franquin. Two albums have been published. In 2013 Jippes stated in an interview: "that project's dead in the water. Though I've finished writing a third story I lack the time and funding to start drawing and coloring those 44-plus pages."
