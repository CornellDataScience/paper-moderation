Dic Siôn Dafydd ([dɪk ʃoːn ˈdavɨ̞ð], "Dick [son of] John [son of] David") is a satirical stereotype of an Anglophile Welsh person who deliberately turns their back on the Welsh people, their culture and the Welsh language. A Dic Siôn Dafydd instead embraces the concept of Englishness, English culture and the English language. It is traditionally used as an insult.


== History and symbolism ==
Jac Glan-y-gors created a satirical portrait of 'Dic Siôn Dafydd' as a stereotypical Welshman who has consciously decided to forget his roots and turn his back on his nation, culture and language, influenced by a will to succeed in England. The 18th-century ballad describes Dic Siôn Dafydd as a pompous character that has grown up speaking Welsh but insists on speaking English even to his Welsh-speaking mother.
Dic Siôn Dafydd is also known to be used as a term for abuse or as an insult that has political connotations. It refers to someone from Wales who betrays their nation for their own financial or political gain, or simply having turned their back on their country. More recently it has been used as an insult for Welsh people who become part of the upper levels of the British establishment but forget their Welsh roots. The character has been described as a Welsh person speaking only English, who is an anglophile and/or anglicised, self-loathing of Wales or its identity, refuses to speak Welsh, or is simply a "traitor".
