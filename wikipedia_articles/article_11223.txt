== Broadcast ==
The second series was scheduled originally to be broadcast in January 1969. Instead, the BBC decided to repeat the first series in January 1969 because they believed many people had missed the series when it had started in the summer of 1968. Consequently, "A Stripe for Frazer" was originally planned for transmission on 27 January 1969, but was delayed until 29 March 1969. It was repeated on 5 September 1969.


== Radio episode ==
The radio version of this episode was adapted by Michael Knowles and Harold Snoad and was first broadcast on 18 March 1974.
