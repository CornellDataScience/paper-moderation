Thalheim an der Thur is a municipality in the district of Andelfingen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.


== History ==
Thalheim an der Thur is first mentioned in 1166 as Torlinchovin.  In 1257 it was mentioned as Torlinkon.  Until 1878 it was Dorlikon.  The name may have originated from the Alamanni name Torilo which originated in the 7th century.  However, as this name could easily be taken to mean "Fools' Village" (from the nowadays old-fashioned expression Tor, German for "fool"), the community was granted a name change to Thalheim an der Thur in 1878. The original name is still used in the area.
