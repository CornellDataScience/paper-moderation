The 2024–25 UEFA Conference League league phase began on 2 October and will end on 19 December 2024. A total of 36 teams are competing in the league phase to decide the 24 places in the knockout phase of the 2024–25 UEFA Conference League.
Borac Banja Luka, Celje, Cercle Brugge, 1. FC Heidenheim, Jagiellonia Białystok, Larne, Noah, Pafos, Petrocub Hîncești, The New Saints and Víkingur Reykjavík made their debut appearances in a major UEFA competition group or league phase. Noah became the first club in Conference League history to successfully navigate all four rounds of qualification, while The New Saints and Larne were the first teams from the Welsh and Northern Irish associations, respectively, to play in a major UEFA competition group or league stage. A total of 29 national associations are represented in the league phase.
This is the first season with the single-league format, which replaces the group format used until the previous season. With the format change, the number of matches prior to the knockout phase will increase from 96 to 108. Vitória de Guimarães' Samu was the first-ever goalscorer of the competition's league phase.


== Format ==
Each team will play six matches, three at home and three away, against six different opponents, with all 36 teams ranked in a single league table. Teams were separated into six pots based on their 2024 UEFA club coefficients, and each team will play one team from each of the six pots. The top eight ranked teams will receive a bye to the round of 16. The teams ranked from 9th to 24th will contest the knockout phase play-offs, with the teams ranked from 9th to 16th seeded for the draw. Teams ranked from 25th to 36th are eliminated from the competition.


=== Tiebreakers ===
Teams will be ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are equal on points upon completion of the league phase, the following tiebreaking criteria are applied, in the order given, to determine their rankings:

Goal difference;
Goals scored;
Away goals scored;
Wins;
Away wins;
Higher number of points obtained collectively by league phase opponents;
Superior collective goal difference of league phase opponents;
Higher number of goals scored collectively by league phase opponents;
Lower disciplinary points total (direct red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points);
UEFA club coefficient.
During the league phase, criteria 1 to 5 will be used to rank teams who have equal number of points. Should any teams be equal on points and tied on the first five criteria, they will be considered equal in position and sorted alphabetically. Criteria 6 to 10 will only be used to break ties upon completion of all matches.


== Teams and seeding ==
The 36 teams were divided into six pots of six teams each, with teams allocated to pots based on their 2024 UEFA club coefficients. The participants include:

24 winners of the play-off round (5 from the Champions Path, 19 from the Main Path)
12 losers of the Europa League play-off round

Notes


== Draw ==
The draw for the league phase pairings was held at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 30 August 2024, 14:30 CEST. All 36 teams were manually drawn using physical balls. For every team manually drawn, automated software digitally drew their opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones were away. Each team will face one opponent from each of the six pots, three of which they will face at home and three away. For the purposes of determining match venues, adjacent pots were paired (Pot 1 with 2, 3 with 4, and 5 with 6) so that, for each pot pairing, teams faced one opponent at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association. The draw started with Pot 1, assigning opponents to all teams, one after the other, and continued with the other pots in ascending order until all teams were assigned their opponents.
The switch to a primarily computer-based draw was made due to issues with the complexity and duration required by a manual draw. The draw software, developed by AE Live, guaranteed total randomness within the framework of the draw conditions and prevented any deadlock situations. The software was reviewed by external auditor Ernst & Young, which also provided review and control of the manual and digital draw operations on-site.
The venue for each club's fixtures is shown in brackets below (H: home; A: away).
