I Can See Your Voice is an American television mystery music game show series based on the South Korean program of the same title. It premiered on Fox on September 23, 2020, and has aired for three seasons.


== Gameplay ==


=== Format ===
Presented with a group of six "mystery singers", a guest artist and contestant(s) must attempt to eliminate bad singers from the group without ever hearing them sing, assisted by clues and a celebrity panel over the course of several rounds. At the end of a game, the last remaining mystery singer is revealed as either good or bad by means of a duet between them and one of the guest artists.
The contestant must eliminate one mystery singer at the end of each round, receiving a petty cash if they eliminate a bad singer. At the end of a game, the contestant may either end the game and keep the money they had won in previous rounds, or risk it for a chance to win $100,000 by correctly guessing whether the last remaining mystery singer is good or bad.


=== Rounds ===


==== Lip sync rounds ====
Each mystery singer performs a lip sync to a song; good singers mime to a recording of their own, while bad singers mime to a recording by someone else. At the conclusion of performances, the contestant(s) eliminate one mystery singer from each group.
Optionally, the contestant(s) may use the Golden Mic once during the game, in which they may hear additional clues and observations from a celebrity guest off-stage.

== Background ==


=== Production and development ===
Fox first announced for a local adaptation of I Can See Your Voice during the Television Critics Association January 2020 press tour, with Ken Jeong (who serves as a panelist on The Masked Singer, a local adaptation of another South Korean program) hosting the pilot episode; this was acquired by Fox for the rights to produce the said show a month later.
The show's staff is managed by (the host himself) Jeong as a co-executive producer alongside with Craig Plestis (also the same role as The Masked Singer), and James McKinlay; this was later assigned by Daniel Martin (for the third season, also as a showrunner).


=== Filming ===
Filming of the show took place at various locations, such as the Television City Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles (from first to second season); and Trilith Studios in Fayetteville (for the third season).
Usually, the program films standalone episodes and are not arranged in order, which would then randomly air during its designated season. This occurred in the first season when it completed a pilot episode before production was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and later resumed by Fox in August 2020 under implementing health and safety protocols, becoming one of the network's first non-scripted programs to do so.


== Broadcast history and release ==
I Can See Your Voice debuted on September 23, 2020, following The Masked Singer's fourth season premiere.
