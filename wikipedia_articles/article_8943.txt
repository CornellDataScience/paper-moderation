The Kikkawa clan (吉川氏, Kikkawa-shi) was a prominent samurai clan of Japan's Sengoku period. The most famous member of the clan is likely Kikkawa Motoharu (1530-1586), one of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's generals, who was adopted into the family. Along with the Kobayakawa clan, the Kikkawa played an important role in Hideyoshi's Kyūshū Campaign (1586-7), and later became daimyō in Izumo Province and Iwakuni after that.


== Origins ==
The founder of the clan, Kikkawa Tsuneyoshi (吉川経義), was a son of Irie Kageyoshi (入江景義). The Irie clan descends through the Kudō clan from the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan. 
The family takes the name from a place called Kikkawa in Irie no sho domain, in Suruga province. Tsuneyoshi distinguished himself in the search and seizure of Kajiwara Kagetoki and gained a territory in Fukui no sho, in Harima Province. He then distinguished himself in the Jokyu War and became the jito of Oasa no sho in Aki Province.
In 1550, Kikkawa Okitsune was murdered by a conspiracy of Mori Motonari, and the main branch of the Kikkawa clan was destroyed. Motoharu, the second son of Mori Motonari received Okitsune's name and estates.
