Melchie Daëlle Dumornay (born 17 August 2003), also known as Corventina, is a Haitian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Première Ligue club Lyon and the Haiti national team.
Considered as one of the most promising talents of her generation in women's football, in 2022 Dumornay won Goal's NXGN award as the best teenage player in the world.


== Club career ==


=== Early life and AS Tigresses ===
Dumornay was born in Mirebalais, where she was raised by a single mother together with her three brothers and two cousins. Shortly after she started playing football with older boys in the commune's streets, she joined her first women's football club, AS Mirebalais. Having been impressed by Dumornay's talent, the club's coach, Jean-Claude Josaphat, brought her to Camp Nous, the federation-owned training center for all of the Haitian youth national teams, when she was only 10 years old.
A few years later, Dumornay joined fellow Haitian club AS Tigresses, where she came through the youth ranks. In the final of the 2018 Haitian Women’s Soccer Championship, she scored all of the five goals that helped Tigresses gain a 5–2 win over Anacaona SC and win the national title. Having scored 25 goals in nine matches, despite being just 15 years old, she also became the league’s top scorer and received the Best Player award.
In the same year, Dumornay was noticed by Reims' manager, Amandine Miquel, while performing at the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in France, as the club eventually kept scouting her. Meanwhile, she was also offered a trial by fellow French club Lyon. However, neither of the two clubs were able to sign the player because of her non-EU and underage status at the time, as well as the effects of the Haitian crisis.
In May 2021, Dumornay reached another league final with Tigresses, although the team eventually lost the title to Exafoot: she scored her side's only goal in a 2–1 defeat.


=== Reims ===
After attracting the interest of several high-profile clubs all around the world, on 9 September 2021, Dumornay officially joined Reims on a permanent deal, signing her first professional contract with the French club. In the process, she re-united with fellow Haitian footballer Kethna Louis.
On 2 October of the same year, she made her professional debut for Reims, coming on as a substitute at half-time of a Division 1 Féminine match against Issy: in the same occasion, she provided two assists for Kessya Bussy, thus helping her side gain a 3–1 win. One week later, on 9 October, she made her first start against Bordeaux, scoring a brace and serving an assist in a 5–2 victory.
In the following season, Dumornay was awarded as Division 1 Féminine Player of the Month in December 2022.


=== Lyon ===
On 16 January 2023, it was officially announced that Dumornay would join Division 1 Féminine title holders Lyon on a permanent deal starting from 1 July 2023, as she signed a contract until June 2026 with the club for 25000 per month.


== International career ==


=== Youth national teams ===
Dumornay represented Haiti at various youth international levels.
After taking part in the 2016 CONCACAF Girls' U-15 Championship, aged only 12, she took part in three different tournaments throughout 2018. Firstly, she played in the 2018 CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship, where Haiti finished third and became the first-ever Caribbean national team to qualify for a FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. Secondly, she was called-up for the 2018 CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championship, where she helped the Haitian team reach a fourth-place finish and received the Golden Ball. Finally, in August of the same year, she was included in the Haitian squad that took part in the 2018 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.
In 2020, she was involved once again in the CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship, where she eventually received the Golden Boot, having scored 14 goals in six games, a new record for the competition.


=== Haiti senior national team ===
On 29 January 2020, Dumornay made her debut with the Haitian senior national team, starting and playing full 90 minutes in a 4–0 Olympic qualifier loss against the United States.
On 9 April 2022, she scored twice in a 0–21 win over the British Virgin Islands, in the 2022 CONCACAF W Championship qualifiers, which became Les Grenadières' biggest victory ever in an official international match.
In July 2022, she was included in the Haitian squad that took part in the CONCACAF W Championship in Mexico: she was eventually named as the Best Young Player and included in the tournament's Best XI, having helped Haiti qualify for the inter-confederation play-offs for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.
On 21 February 2023, Dumornay scored a brace in the inter-confederation play-off final against Chile, thus helping her nation gain a 2–1 win and qualify for its first ever FIFA Women's World Cup.
In July of the same year, she was officially included in the final Haitian squad for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand; Les Grenadières eventually exited the competition in the group stage.


== Personal life ==
In the early phases of her career, Dumornay was nicknamed Piti (the Haitian Creole term for "small") due to her diminutive stature. She is also known as Corventina, a nickname that was first given to her by her older brother.
In November 2022, she signed a long-term sponsorship deal with Adidas.
