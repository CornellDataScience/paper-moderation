== History ==

== Activity ==


=== 'No Exam with Hunger' campaign ===

The first campaign that Student's Union held is the 'No Exam with Hunger' campaign on 2 February 2020, against price rises made to dining hall and transportation. While raises were being made to university dining halls, high school canteens and transportation, the raise declared by Istanbul University caused a reaction countrywide. The protests that took place in the university got supported by opposition figures and intellectuals. While rectorate's stepping back on 6 January was a progress for students, the suicide of university student Sibel Ünli due to poverty and lack of livelihood caused indignation in the country.
Students' Union, after all of those events, started a signature campaign on 2 February 2020, via Change.org, against to life expenses of students. Union members that had started to open stands all over the country have asked for all dining expenses to be fixed to 1,5 TL. Students also demanded that municipalities should distribute soup in the mornings in front of the universities, withdrawing the raises made to transportation in Istanbul and fixation of such costs to an acceptable level in other cities.


=== COVID-19 pandemic and distance learning ===
After the COVID-19 pandemic starting in the country, while students were getting online education from EbaTV of primary, junior high and high school level, university students were getting the type of education their schools have decides themselves.

The reaction of Students' Union about that was started with the closure of student dormitories by government. By that unplanned decision, the students were forced to return their homes, and were filled in bus terminals uncontrollably due to the lack of planning. At the same time, the arrival of people coming from foreign countries to the dormitories which were being used for quarantine was also among concerns.
Students' Union spread the decision of rectorate to close dormitories and demanded planning to related officials. Many rectorates starting with METU withdrew their decisions to some degree.
Students' Union committed several actions during the pandemic. Alongside of "stay home" calls, they have done statements about staying safe during COVID-19 and kept their protests regarding dormitory debts, free internet and helping students whose dormitory scholarship are cancelled.
