In mathematics, the twisted Poincaré duality is a theorem removing the restriction on Poincaré duality to oriented manifolds. The existence of a global orientation is replaced by carrying along local information, by means of a local coefficient system.


== Twisted Poincaré duality for de Rham cohomology ==
Another version of the theorem with real coefficients features de Rham cohomology with values in the orientation bundle. This is the flat real line bundle denoted 
  
    
      
        o
        (
        M
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle o(M)}
  
, that is trivialized by coordinate charts of the manifold 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
  
, with transition maps the sign of the Jacobian determinant of the charts transition maps.  As a flat line bundle, it has a de Rham cohomology, denoted by

  
    
      
        
          H
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        M
        ;
        
          
            R
          
          
            w
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{*}(M;\mathbb {R} ^{w})}
  
 or 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        M
        ;
        o
        (
        M
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{*}(M;o(M))}
  
.
For M a compact manifold, the top degree cohomology is equipped with a so-called trace morphism

  
    
      
        θ
        :
        
          H
          
            d
          
        
        (
        M
        ;
        o
        (
        M
        )
        )
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta \colon H^{d}(M;o(M))\to \mathbb {R} }
  
,
that is to be interpreted as integration on M, i.e., evaluating against the fundamental class.
Poincaré duality for differential forms is then the conjunction, for M connected, of the following two statements:

The trace morphism is a linear isomorphism.
The cup product, or exterior product of differential forms

  
    
      
        ∪
        :
        
          H
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        M
        ;
        
          R
        
        )
        ⊗
        
          H
          
            d
            −
            ∗
          
        
        (
        M
        ,
        o
        (
        M
        )
        )
        →
        
          H
          
            d
          
        
        (
        M
        ,
        o
        (
        M
        )
        )
        ≃
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cup \colon H^{*}(M;\mathbb {R} )\otimes H^{d-*}(M,o(M))\to H^{d}(M,o(M))\simeq \mathbb {R} }
  

is non-degenerate.
The oriented Poincaré duality is contained in this statement, as understood from the fact that the orientation bundle o(M) is trivial if the manifold is oriented, an orientation being a global trivialization, i.e., a nowhere vanishing parallel section.
