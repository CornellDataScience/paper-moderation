== History ==


=== 2008-2022: Hoa hậu Hoàn vũ Việt Nam ===
In 2008, Công ty Cổ phần Hoàn vũ Nha Trang was granted the national license from the Miss Universe Organization to host the Miss Universe Vietnam competition under the Vietnamese name Hoa hậu Hoàn vũ Việt Nam.
The first official Miss Universe Vietnam contest was held the Vinpearl Land resort in Nha Trang on May 31, 2008, with 20 contestants participating. The final included four competitions: evening gown, swimsuit, áo dài, and interview. The winner, Nguyễn Thùy Lâm, was host delegate for the Miss Universe 2008 pageant held July 14, 2008, also in Nha Trang.
There was no Miss Universe Vietnam held from 2009 to 2014, so the winner or runners-up of either Miss Universe Vietnam or any other national pageant could be appointed as Miss Universe Vietnam.
Miss Universe Vietnam 2015 was held on October 3, 2015, at Crown Convention Center in Nha Trang, Vietnam, and organised by Công ty Cổ phần Hoàn vũ Sài Gòn (Unicorp).
From 2017, the pageant was accompanied by a reality television series called I Am Miss Universe Vietnam, in which contestants are put through different challenges and training programs in each weekly episode.
Until 2022, the pageant used to select the country's representative to the Miss Universe but ultimately changed to the current English name after losing the license in 2023. Now the pageant is renamed Miss Cosmo Vietnam.


=== 2023-present ===
In 2023, the Vietnamese Miss Universe franchise was granted to a new license holder. However, Hoa hậu Hoàn vũ Việt Nam continued to be held as a standalone pageant under the new title - Miss Cosmo Vietnam. The winner of Hoa hậu Hoàn vũ Việt Nam would no longer be Miss Universe Vietnam and the new Miss Universe Vietnam competition would abandoned its Vietnamese name.
