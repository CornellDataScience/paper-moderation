The 2011–12 National League 1 is the third season of the third division of the English domestic rugby union competitions since the professionalised format of the second division was introduced. Birmingham & Solihull find themselves playing in this league following their relegation from the 2010–11 RFU Championship in the play-offs, whilst other newcomers to the league in this season are Ealing Trailfinders and Jersey, and Fylde, who won promotion to the league from the 2010–11 National League 2 South and 2010–11 National League 2 North respectively.
The league title was contested by two of the newly promoted sides with Jersey finishing the season ahead of rivals Ealing Trailfinders, despite a 5-point deduction.  By winning the league Jersey secured their third promotion in as many seasons, moving up to the 2012–13 RFU Championship.  They were also easily the most popular team in the division with over 33,000 fans attending the 15 home games held at St Peter - a National League 1 record.  At the opposite end of the table, Birmingham & Solihull and Stourbridge were relegated to the 2012–13 National League 2 North while Barking dropped down to the 2012–13 National League 2 South having been league runners up the previous season.
