Ferris, also spelled Ferriss, is both a given name and a family name. It is related to the name Fergus in Ireland, and the name Ferrers in England. In Ireland, the Ferris family of County Kerry derives its surname from the patronymic Ó Fearghusa. It is also the English spelling of the similar Arabic derived names (Faris, Farris, Feras, Firas).
