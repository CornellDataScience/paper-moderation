Since then Jyoshna has gone on as a solo artist and recorded many stunning albums.
Jyoshna is always looking for new ways to express and explore music and spirituality from both western and eastern prospective, fusing sounds of traditional Indian music with western sensibility, Taonga Puoro and singer/songwriter styles.
Jyoshna's music has taken her to many countries of the world and at each place she has collaborated with local musicians: in India with the Mahato Kiirtan group and the Rarhi Chhau dance musicians; in London with the RAWA group; in Vermont USA with local musicians Tina Tourin and friends and in Brazil with Matrika (Cecilia Valentim, Sergio Leone, and Ramon Soza and friends). Her music has featured on Brazilian TV, NRK Norwegian and NZ TV. As an original composer, Jyoshna has authored many albums of both her own, as well as ethnographic material, including Red Earth Song (1996), Magnificence (2001) and Unity Hours I (2008), Unity Hours II (2010), Unity Hours III (2019), Unity Hours (2022). Jyoshna has composed music for the New Zealand feature film Stars in Her Eyes (2016, Dir. by Athina Tsoulis) and completed a new album called Dharma Cakra, Sanskrit songs for Meditation. Jyoshna is presently working as an itinerant lecturer, music teacher and composer at Bethells Beach in Auckland. Her other passion is ethnomusicology, and in 2010 she completed her PhD in music, at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London on "Marai Kirtan and the Performance of Ecstasy in the Purulia District of West Bengal, India".
Jyoshna's research focuses on the 'praise music of West Bengal (Rarh), India, as well as Maori and indigenous people's music. She also has her own collection of audio visual material housed at the World Music Archives, British Library (C1211).


== Kirtan ==
As a musician and ethnomusicologist of eastern devotional singing, kirtan plays a major role in La Trobe's musical and academic career. Many of her music compositions are pada kirtan or 'devotional songs' and nama kirtan or "chanting the name of God". Her research into the background of kirtan led her to Rarh, India, the homeland of the Giita Govinda by Jayadeva (11th century) where she spent 2005–2010 documenting the traditional kirtan performances. Her own kirtan compositions are a blend of western singer/songwriter genres and Rarh devotional music.


== Rarhology ==
Dr Jyoshna La Trobe's pioneering research work on the music culture of Rarh (1996–2010) is documented in her Masters Thesis Red Earth: the Music Culture of Rarh (University of Auckland) and her PhD Red Earth Song: marai kirtan and the performance of Ecstasy at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London. Over 120 hours of audio visual material is deposited in the British Library World music Sound Archives in her catalogue called the La Trobe Rarhi Music Collection. Music genres of Rarh covered in the PhD include: jhumur 'folk songs', Baul 'mystic songs', nacini nach 'dancing girls dance' and the Chhau 'masked martial dance of the ancient warrior' as well as a musical analysis and transcriptions of marai kirtan 'praise music' performance. Video footage also includes Prabhat Samgiita ('songs of the new dawn'), composed by P. R. Sarkar.
