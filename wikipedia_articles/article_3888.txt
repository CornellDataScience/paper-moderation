The 2024–25 CONCACAF Nations League Play-in is the post group stage round of Leagues A and C of the 2024–25 edition of the CONCACAF Nations League, the fourth season of the international football competition involving the men's national teams of the 41 member associations of CONCACAF. It will be held from 14 to 19 November 2024.
The play-in round will serve as a qualifier for the Gold Cup prelims, the pre-Gold Cup competition that will determines the final teams to qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup.


== Format ==
The play-in round will be contested by the two bottom teams from each group of League A (teams ranked 5th and 6th) and the top four teams from League C (three group winners and the best team among the group runners-up). These eight teams were divided into four ties.
Each tie is played on a home-and-away two-legged basis, with the teams from League A hosting the second legs. If the aggregate score is level at the end of the second leg the away goals rule would be applied. If away goals were also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time would be played without taking into account the away goals rule during this time. If still tied after extra time, the tie would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.
Winners will qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification.
