== Education ==
Erickson moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she earned her BFA in Crafts with a concentration in Ceramics and Art Education K-12 Pre-Certification at The University of the Arts (1996–2000).

Upon her return from Finland, Erickson continued her work as a resident artist at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for three years.  During this time, she also taught at The University of the Arts, Rowan University, Arcadia University, and various art centers in and around the city.

Erickson's work has been shown internationally and is represented in collections around the world.  She has earned numerous awards, including first place for the Horizon Award presented by the Museum of Art and Design in New York and honorable mentions at the Korea Biennale International 2007 & 2009 Exhibitions. The Horizon Awards acknowledge the achievements of young and emerging artists and designers. "Erickson's work represents the excitement that is now infusing functional ceramics," said Tony Hepburn, head of Ceramics at Cranbrook. "It is simply the hybridizing of craft and design. Upbeat, innovative, employing new technologies and allowing this new world to help us rethink how we think about the objects we use."
She was awarded an Independence Fellowship for a summer 2009 residency at The International Ceramic Research Center in Denmark.
