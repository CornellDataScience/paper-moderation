== Smithsonian career ==
Kurin worked on contract as a program manager for the Smithsonian's Festival of American Folklife for the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976. He conducted research for the Smithsonian in India and Pakistan from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s, and served as the program manager for the Smithsonian's Festival of India in 1984â€“85. He worked closely with Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley, Ralph Rinzler and Jeffrey Lariche and Indian designer Rajeev Sethi in organizing Aditi: A Celebration of Life, a major exhibition of the traditional Indian life cycle that included scores of musicians and artisans in the National Museum of Natural History, and curating Mela: An Indian Fair for the Festival of American Folklife outdoors on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. He became deputy director of the Smithsonian's Office of Folklife Programs in 1985, then its acting director in 1988.
In 1990 he was appointed director of the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage by Secretary Robert McCormack Adams, a position he held until 2009. As director, he was responsible for the Smithsonian Folklife Festival on the National Mall, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, and other cultural educational programs. Kurin, working with festival director Diana Parker and Center deputy director Richard Kennedy, arranged for dozens of programs at the festival, among the highlights a program on Massachusetts in 1988, Hawaii in 1989, White House workers, Maroon and New Mexico programs in 1992, Iowa in 1996, Wisconsin in 1998, the Mississippi Delta in 1999, Tibetan culture with the Dalai Lama in 2000, New York City in 2001, and the Silk Road with Yo-Yo Ma and more than 500 other artists from 28 countries in 2002 supported by funds from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. He worked closely with Samuel Sidibe of Mali for the 2003 Festival; Haitian colleagues Geri Benoit, Patrick Delatour, Patrick Villaire and Olsen Jean Julian from Haiti for the 2004 Festival; cultural leaders in Northern Ireland in 2007; and Jigme Thinley, who became the first Prime Minister of Bhutan, for the 2008 Festival.
In 1987 Kurin worked with Ralph Rinzler on the acquisition of Folkways from Moses Asch and family. This included the production of a benefit album to raise funds for the acquisition. The album Folkways: A Vision Shared featured Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, U2 and others. Produced by Columbia Records with Don Devito and Harold Levanthal, it won a Grammy Award for best traditional folk album.
Kurin worked with fellow anthropologist Tony Seeger as the first director of Smithsonian Folkways Recordings and enlisted Grateful Dead drummer and musicologist Mickey Hart to re-engineer the collection. Smithsonian Folkways went on to produce more than a dozen Grammy winning and nominated albums, including the Anthology of American Folk Song in 1997.
He garnered grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Paul Allen Foundation with John Kertzer to start Smithsonian Global Sounds, a digital music archive and distribution service.
Kurin continued to work with musicians like Yo-Yo Ma and Mickey Hart on other several other recording and educational projects.
Dorothy Height, the president of the National Council of Negro Women, enlisted Kurin to help organize the production of the first National Black Family Reunion on the National Mall in 1986. Aid continued for over two decades.
Kurin produced many of the Smithsonian's major public programs on the National Mall, such as the Smithsonian's Birthday Party in 1996, the National World War II Reunion for the opening of the National World War II Memorial, and the opening of the National Museum of the American Indian, both in 2004. Kurin produced public programs for Presidential Inaugurals in 1993, 1997, 2005, 2009, and 2013. He worked with the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games to produce a cultural festival in Centennial Park during the games in 1996, and with the White House to produce public programs for the celebration of the Millennium at the end of 1999.
Kurin was awarded the Smithsonian Secretary's Gold Medal for Exceptional Service in 1996.
Kurin, with support from the U.S. Department of State, was appointed by the Director-General of UNESCO to a distinguished international jury for the Masterpieces of Oral and Intangible Heritage program in 1999. In the same year, Kurin organized an international conference on Safeguarding Traditional Cultures with UNESCO at the Smithsonian. Kurin advised the U.S. Department of State on the development of an international treaty concerning traditional cultural heritage, and participated in an international experts group to help draft the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage which was approved by UNESCO in 2003 and has been ratified by more than 160 nations. Kurin led Smithsonian efforts to make the institution a Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Fellowship program site for three years for a project on theorizing cultural heritage. Kurin was appointed by Secretary of State Colin Powell to the U.S. Commission for UNESCO in 2005 and reappointed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2006. Kurin serves as the Smithsonian liaison to the White House Historical Association and the President's Committee for the Arts and the Humanities.
While director of the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, Kurin was appointed chair of the Smithsonian's 150th anniversary program committee by Secretary I. Michael Heyman. In 2004, Kurin was appointed acting director of Smithsonian National Programs by Secretary Lawrence Small, and two years later, director, overseeing the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, The Smithsonian Associates, Smithsonian Affiliates and other educational programs as well as the programmatic aspects of the Smithsonian Channel, a cable television partnership with Showtime.

In 2009, Secretary G. Wayne Clough made the appointment permanent. In addition to overseeing museums and programs, Kurin shares responsibilities for the Smithsonian's Libraries, Archives, Fellowships, Collections and International Programs with the Under Secretary for Science. In 2009, Kurin organized the Smithsonian 2.0 conference, pairing Smithsonian staff with leaders in web and digital media from academic, educational and business worlds.
In 2010, Kurin founded and organized the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project with the U.S. President's Committee for the Arts and the Humanities and other cultural organizations to help save that nation's heritage after the devastating earthquake. Funded by U.S.AID, The Broadway League, and other sponsors, the project sent more than 80 conservators to Haiti, trained more than 150 Haitians and saved some 35,000 artworks, artifacts, murals, sculptures, rare books and archives. Kurin later joined with colleagues to develop and support an advanced internship for Haitian conservators at Yale University, and with the Ben Stiller Foundation to establish and build a Cultural Conservation Center at Quisqueya University in Port-au-Prince in 2015. With Cultural Preservation Officer Cori Wegener, Kurin led Smithsonian efforts to save cultural heritage endangered by terrorism in Mali, Egypt, Iraq and Syria, and that threatened by natural disaster in the wake of Superstorm Sandy in New York and the 2015 earthquake in Nepal.
In 2015, David Skorton became Secretary of the Smithsonian and with the approval of the Board of Regents, the White House, and then Congress in 2016, reorganized its senior management, instituting the position of Provost. Kurin was appointed Acting Provost and Under Secretary for Museums, continuing to oversee all of the History, Art, and Culture museums and programs, but subsuming those formerly overseen by the Under Secretary for Science. Kurin became responsible for the National Air and Space Museum and its Stephen-Udvar Hazy Center, National Museum of Natural History, National Zoological Park and its Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
