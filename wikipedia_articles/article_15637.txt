Kelly Darryl Girtz (born November 12, 1971) is an American educator and politician currently serving as mayor of the unified government of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, having succeeded Nancy Denson in January 2019.  Before he was sworn in as mayor, Girtz maintained a long career as a teacher and school administrator in Northeast Georgia.


== Early life ==

Girtz was born on November 12, 1971, in Bath, Maine to Darryl Sylvester and Joanne (n√©e Kirsch) Girtz (now Claridge), while his father was stationed aboard the USS Dale.  The Dale was homeported in Newport, Rhode Island, where Girtz and his family then lived for a year before moving to Oakland, California for a year.  From 1974 to 1994, he was raised and resided in Norfolk, Virginia, where he graduated from Lake Taylor High School in 1989. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Old Dominion University in 1993.


== Educator ==
Girtz earned his Master of Arts in Teaching from Piedmont College.  From 1998 to 2014, he was a teacher and administrator in the Clarke County School District in Athens.  He then served as Regional Director for Student Services and Special Education for Foothills Charter High School, a public charter high school.


== Political career ==


=== County commissioner ===
In November 2006, Girtz was elected to serve as a member of the Athens-Clarke County commission, representing District 9.  He was re-elected unopposed in both 2010 and 2014.


=== Mayoral candidate ===
In May 2017, Girtz announced that he would run for mayor of Athens-Clarke County.  On May 22, 2018, he defeated fellow commissioner Harry Sims and local businessman Richie Knight, earning over 60 percent of the vote, to become mayor-elect.


=== Mayor ===

Girtz was sworn in as Mayor on January 8, 2019.  Former Clarke County School District Board of Education member Ovita Thornton was sworn in as Girtz's replacement for the District 9 commissioner seat. During the 2020 COV-ID 19 pandemic in the United States, Girtz urged Athens residents to continue sheltering in place, opposing Governor Brian Kemp's April 20 announcement that non-essential Georgia businesses, like gyms and hair salons, could re-open that week.
During the Black Lives Matter protests of late May/early June 2020, Mayor Girtz joined protesters in calling for the removal of a Confederate monument on Broad Street. The demand came after local law enforcement teargassed protesters at a March for a World Without Cops demonstration in front of the University of Georgia Arch on the night of May 31.
Girtz was re-elected in May 2022 with around 60 percent of the vote.
