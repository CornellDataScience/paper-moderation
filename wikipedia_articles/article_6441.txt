André Johan Joubert (born 15 April 1964 in Ladysmith) is a former South African rugby union player, widely known as "The Rolls-Royce of Fullbacks" for his pace, class, and seemingly effortless style. He was capped 34 times at fullback for the Springboks in the 1990s, and amassed 115 test points from 10 tries, 17 penalties and 7 conversions.


== 1995 Rugby World Cup ==
Joubert played a major role in the Springboks' success at the 1995 Rugby World Cup held in South Africa, most notably turning in an outstanding performance in the 15-12 win over the All Blacks in the final, despite playing with a broken hand. The quarterfinal almost proved to be the end of Joubert's World Cup when his hand was broken in contact with Western Samoa player George Harder. That same night he went for surgery and spent time in a decompression chamber.


== Domestic career ==
While a student at the University of the Free State, Joubert made his debut for the Free State in 1986. In 1992 he moved to Natal and continued to represent the union, that later was renamed the Sharks, until 1999.
Joubert was first choice fullback for the Sharks during the inaugural Super 12 competition in 1996, helping them reach the final against the Auckland Blues. Also, in 1996, he was man of the match against the then Transvaal, in the Currie Cup final as he scored two tries. Joubert won three Currie Cups: '92, '95 & '96.
He played his last competitive rugby match in the 1999 Currie Cup Final for the Sharks against the Gauteng Lions, a match which also saw the final appearances of Gary Teichmann and Ian McIntosh as captain and coach respectively. It was a sad farewell for three of Natal's favourite sons as the Lions lifted the cup with a convincing 32–9 victory.


== International career ==
He made his international debut, aged 25, in 1989 against a World XV in a game the Springboks won 20–19. His final international appearance came in 1997, playing a major role by assisting Percy Montgomery and others in scoring tries and demolishing Australia 61–22, the Wallabies in Pretoria.
