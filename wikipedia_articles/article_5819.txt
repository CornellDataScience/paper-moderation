The Florida Gators football program is a college football team that represents the University of Florida in the sport of American football. The Florida Gators compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Twenty-nine men have served as the Gators' head coach since the university first fielded a team in 1906, including five who served as interim coach for a portion of a season. Of these, Charlie Bachman, Ray Graves, Doug Dickey, and Steve Spurrier have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Florida's head coach has been named as the SEC's coach of the year on eight occasions.
Two Gators coaches have led the team to SEC championships: Steve Spurrier won six conference titles while Urban Meyer won two. They also led the Gators to their three national championships; one under Spurrier (in 1996) and two under Meyer (2006 and 2008). Spurrier is Florida's all-time leader in seasons coached (12), conference wins (87), overall wins (122), and winning percentage for coaches serving for two or more seasons (.817).
Since 2022, Florida's head coach has been Billy Napier.
