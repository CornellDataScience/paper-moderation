In 1818, the land that would become Shelbyville was ceded to the United States by the Miami tribe in the Treaty of St. Mary's. Also in 1818, the backwoodsman Jacob Whetzel and a party cut a trail through this "New Purchase" from the Whitewater River at Laurel due west to the White River at Waverly. This trail became known as Whetzel's Trace and was the first east–west road into the New Purchase of central Indiana. Whetzel's Trace was cut just 4 miles north of site of Shelbyville and proved important in the settlement of Shelby County.
Shelbyville was platted in 1822. Shelbyville was named in honor of Isaac Shelby, the first and fifth Governor of Kentucky and soldier in Lord Dunmore's War, the Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812. The town incorporated January 21, 1850.

But no public education was provided for Shelbyville's black residents.  In that year, the state of Indiana required communities to provide free public education for all Indiana children, similar to that already available in most Eastern states since the 1840s, but allowed the various towns / counties to choose whether they would be racially integrated as in the North or segregated as beginning to be done in the coming "Jim Crow" era  of the subsequent 1880s and after of a series of discrimination laws beginning in the South. In the Midwest region town of Shelbyville and its schools were for several decades since the beginning of the 20th century were racially integrated at the high school level, but segregated in the lower elementary grades until opened in 1949, five years before the landmark unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court in "Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas" in May 1954 to outlaw legal segregation.
