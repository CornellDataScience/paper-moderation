== Leadership ==
The Board's current chairman is Yidel Perlstein, and its district manager is Barry Spitzer.


=== Controversies ===
Perlstein, the first Hasidic Jew to fill the position, was elected in March 2012, unseating 19-year veteran Alex Dubrow. Perlstein's  win was controversial due to his having served only nine months out of the twelve required in order to qualify for a candidacy. Perlstein was vigorously supported by New York City Councilmember David G. Greenfield, his intervention being called "an unprecedented act of intimidation by an elected official" by board members.
During a taped phone conversation, Perlstein described how at a September 2015 breakfast meeting in Williamsburg, Brooklyn he convinced a New York City Police Department assistant chief to appeal to future Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill to keep a friendly promoted lieutenant at the 66th Precinct, a police station in Community Board 12. This went contrary to standard procedure of transferring promoted officers to other precincts in order to prevent animosity from peers, and corruption. The officer was later found to be connected to Alex Lichtenstein, a Shomrim leader who was convicted in 2017 of bribing police officers almost $1 million in order to receive 150 gun permits for resale to community members. The lieutenant was subsequently stripped of his badge and gun, and transferred.
