== Biography ==
Halperin was influenced by Lennie Tristano, and he got lessons with Tristano and Sal Mosca at a young age. He did his first recordings in 1986 with the Warne Marsh Quintet (Back Home at the label CrissCross). Since 1982, Halperin worked with bassist Dominic Duval and the first joint recordings were made until 2003.
In 1997 Halperin released his debut album under his own name on the label Zinnia, a Tristano-dedicated duet with Sal Mosca (Psalm). In 1998 he joined the Thomas Andersen Quintet (NorCD), and in 2001, he participated in a trio with bassist Don Messina and drummer Bill Chattin on Cadence Jazz Records. At this time he also worked at CIMP as a session musician with Duval and Jay Rosen.
In 2003 he released the album Joy And Gravitas, also on CIMP, with interpretations of jazz standards, i.e. "A Night in Tunisia", "Love for Sale", "My Funny Valentine", "Don't Explain", "Naima" and "Round Midnight!. This was followed by the duo album Monkinus by Halperin and Duval on the label CIMP. In 2009 Halperin and Duval recorded the music of Thelonious Monk on the album Monk Dreams, released on the Lithuanian label NoBusiness Records. In June 2009 they played at the Jazzfest Villach.
Halperin has also played with pianist Andreas Schmidt, Alex Hagen 'Stringproject', and in 2007, he recorded as a duo with guitarist Joe Giglio - "Sound Scape". In 2015 the album "Snow Tiger" was released, a collaboration with Swedish guitarist Pål Nyberg, with whom he toured extensively from 2015 to 2017.
