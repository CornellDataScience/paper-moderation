Venkat Arikatla of Greatandhra rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "Samajavaragamana is a family entertainer with both funny and romantic parts. However, Sree Vishnu has always been good at playing middle-class young roles. He has superb comic timing. After a long wait, he landed a role that was right in his wheelhouse, and he nailed it with ease. Reba Monika looks suited for the role.
