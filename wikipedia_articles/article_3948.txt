The Young Motion powered by Resa GP team is a Dutch motocross racing team that competes in the Motocross World Championship and the Dutch Masters of Motocross in the MX2 class. The team is owned by Young Motion, a video agency from the Netherlands, which aims to help young privateers to make the next step
Founded in 2022 to compete at the Grand Prix level under the name Powered by Young Motion, the team started their first season by supporting Glen Meier in MX2 and Jens Walvoort and Meico Vettik in the European championship. Vettik impressed with a podium result and 11th overall after missing 3 races, while Meier scored the first world championship points for the team.
In 2023 the team expanded and set up a partnership with Resa Racing, a Yamaha dealer, to take care of the technical aspects of the team. The teamname was changed to Young Motion powered by Resa to reflect this. Riders were GP veteran Petr Polak and Dutch rookies Raf Meuwissen and Mike Bolink. Meuwissen was replaced during the season by French rider Saad Soulimani. Polak scored 23 points while Mike Bolink finished 10th overall in the Dutch Masters.
For 2024 the team dropped the association with Yamaha while continuing the partnership with Resa Racing. The team signed three Scandinavian riders for the MX2 class in Sampo Rainio, Arvid Lüning and Filip Olsson. They will compete in the majority of the European Grand Prix, the Dutch Masters and the Swedish and Finnish championship. Lüning scored the team's best ever finish with a 14th in MX2 GP of Sardegna early in the season and followed that up with a 16th place finish in Latvia. At this GP Olsson scored his first points of the season.
