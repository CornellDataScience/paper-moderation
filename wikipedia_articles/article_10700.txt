The Ordre des Palmes Académiques (Order of Academic Palms) is an order of knighthood of France for academics and cultural and educational figures. The early Palmes académiques was instituted on 17 March 1808 and was only awarded to teachers or professors.  In 1850 the decoration was divided into two known classes:

Officier de l'Instruction Publique (Golden Palms)
Officier d'Académie (Silver Palms)
Since 1955 the Ordre des palmes académiques has comprised three grades:

Commandeur (Commander) — medallion worn on necklet
Officier (Officer) — medallion worn on ribbon with rosette on left breast
Chevalier (Knight) – medallion worn on ribbon on left breast
In 1866, the scope of the award was widened to include major contributions to French national education and culture made by anyone, including foreigners. It was also made available to any French expatriates making major contributions to the expansion of French culture throughout the world.
