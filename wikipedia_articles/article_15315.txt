He has been closely involved in the work of London's poetry group "Piccadilly Poets" and The Live Poet's Society in Bath.

In 2004 Bailey adjudicated the prestigious Sasakawa Prize for Haikai. His poetry and commentaries have appeared in a wide variety of publications. Originally trained as a psychologist he is now a self-supporting writer and lives in Swindon, Wiltshire, at the heart of his beloved North Wessex countryside.
