== History ==
The town was first settled prior to 1800. The area was known as "West Chateaugay," and was proposed to be the town of "Birney," but the name "Burke" was selected instead, presumably for Edmund Burke, the British statesman. The town of Burke was formed in 1844 from the town of Chateaugay.
Almanzo Wilder, often thought to be a native of nearby Malone, actually grew up on a farm in Burke. He was the husband of Little House on the Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder, who told his story in the novel Farmer Boy. The son of James and Angeline Day Wilder, he was born on his family's farm on February 13, 1857. In 1875, the family left to settle in Minnesota.
