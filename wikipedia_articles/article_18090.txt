== Biography ==
Born Christine Chu, she attended Deming University in Taipei and graduated with a bachelor's degree in accounting in 1979. She married Marcel Liang in 1984. Half a year after their marriage, Marcel left Taiwan to pursue his graduate degree at Emporia State University in Emporia, Kansas, while she remained in Taiwan, working for a jewelry store. Marcel received his MBA in 1986 and moved to the Silicon Valley to work for a motherboard manufacturer, where Liang joined him.
Initially she was employed by a retail firm that sold computer keyboards and cases, but decided to open her own business importing computer components from Asia and distributing them in the United States. She founded Asia Source Inc. in Sunnyvale, California, in 1987, using $16,000 in personal savings. In 1989 Marcel joined the company as Chairman and CEO. As the company branched into distribution of U.S.-made products, the business name was changed to ASI in 2001.
Liang credits her older brother, James Chu, founder of ViewSonic, with stocking ASI's initial inventory by selling her computer monitors and components at cost price. ASI imports and distributes monitors, disk drives, keyboards, motherboards, and floppy drives. Its clients are large computer companies and retailers, as well as value-added resellers who build computers for specific markets and needs.
