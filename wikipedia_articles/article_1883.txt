The Utah Aviation Hall of Fame was established in 1996 to honor and recognize individuals in the State of Utah who have contributed significantly to Utah aviation. These people have distinguished themselves through major contributions in advancing aviation or heroic accomplishments as civil or military aviators in and for the State of Utah.
It is the greater goal of this program is to foster public appreciation for the contributions of these individuals to the education of air power. Specifically, the continuing education and development of civil or general, commercial, and military aviation throughout the State.
The official recognition of the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame was proclaimed by the Governor in 1996. It Governor proclaimed the 32nd Flight (Pioneer), Order of Daedalians, the National Fraternity of Military Pilots, as the sponsor and custodial agency for the program.  Honorees are inducted each year around Memorial Day.
