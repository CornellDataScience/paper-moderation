During a match between DC United and Inter Miami on 18 September 2022, Fountas was accused of racially abusing defender Damion Lowe by calling him the n-word. He was later substituted, while MLS opened an official investigation into the incident. Inter Miami coach Phil Neville commented on the incident: "It was a racist comment. It was unacceptable. A word was used. I think it's unacceptable in society. A word was used, I think, the worst word in the world. And that's it, really." Fountas denied the allegation. MLS ultimately decided that the accusation by a Miami player who claimed to have heard Fountas saying something to Lowe (who apparently did not hear the comment himself) was "credible" but that it could not be verified.
On 21 July 2023, DC United announced the suspension of Fountas along with teammate Nigel Robertha for "possible violations of league policy." Although the reason for the suspension was not mentioned in the club's statement, The Athletic reported that Fountas flung a racial slur at Robertha during a training session and the latter responded by physically attacking Fountas. Subsequent reporting indicated that Robertha attacked Fountas with a foam roller in the locker room following their July 15 away game against the New England Revolution, with Robertha claiming that Fountas used the n-word while arguing on the field before being separated by Christian Benteke. With an investigation ongoing, the team and Fountas mutually agreed to terminate his contract.
