Afroholic... The Even Better Times is a double-disc hip hop album released by Afroman. Despite Afroman's six-album deal with Universal Records, Afroman recorded one album for Universal, The Good Times, and would release all future albums independently, beginning with this one. There are two versions of this album. The original version featured numerous parody songs. The reissue contained, among others, the song "Whack Rappers", which is a diss to many hip hop and R&B artists, including 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Kelis, Nas and P. Diddy. The album peaked at number 99 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 36 on the Independent Albums chart.


== Promotion ==
Afroman began promoting this album on his website afromanmusic.com in late March of 2004 with the main page saying "Welcome to Afroholics Anonymous, the official support group for Afroholics. Group Therapy is now in Session", as well as an image of the album cover. Around early April 2004, he began promoting that the album would be releasing on the 20th of that month.
