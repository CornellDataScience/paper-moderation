John Forbes Hogan (January 7, 1894 â€“ February 16, 1967) was an American architect from Providence, Rhode Island.
Hogan was born to Mary Josephine Forbes and Thomas Sebastian Hogan in Pawtucket in 1894.  In 1916 he earned a B.S. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and an M.S. the following year.  For 10 months after his latter graduation he traveled in Europe.  From 1919 to 1923 he was employed as a designer in the Providence office of architect George F. Hall, the successor to the better-known firm of Martin & Hall.  In 1923 he left Hall to open his own office in Providence.  He joined the AIA in 1924.
Hogan specialized in buildings for the Catholic church, designing many churches and institutions for the diocese.
