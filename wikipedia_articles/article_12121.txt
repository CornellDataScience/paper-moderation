Black Myth/Out in Space is a 2CD live album by American composer, bandleader and keyboardist Sun Ra recorded in 1970 in Donaueschingen and Berlin and released on the Motor Music label in 1998. Selections from the concerts were originally released in 1970 on MPS Records as It's After the End of the World but the rerelease complies both complete concerts adding more than 75 minutes of previously unissued recordings.


== Reception ==

In a review for Allmusic, Jason Ankeny states, "this two-disc set is far and away the definitive release of the material in question, compiling two 1970 festival appearances documenting Sun Ra at the peak of his considerable creative powers".
