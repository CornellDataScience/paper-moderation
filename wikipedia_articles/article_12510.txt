== Production ==


=== Background ===
The American professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) was founded in January 2019. The company then held its inaugural event, Double or Nothing, in May, followed by Fyter Fest in June. Fight for the Fallen was scheduled as AEW's third-ever event to be held on Saturday, July 13, 2019, at Daily's Place in Jacksonville, Florida; Daily's Place would later become AEW's home base. It was scheduled to be held as a charity event in which all of the gate proceeds would be donated to victims of gun violence, a reference to the event's title. The following month on July 3, it was announced that the special event would be sponsored by Farah & Farah, a personal injury law firm located in Jacksonville, and the proceeds from the gate would be donated to the Jacksonville Victim Assistance Advisory Council.
On July 9, AEW wrestler Chris Jericho was announced as appearing in a non-wrestling role at the event. Fight for the Fallen was streamed for free on the B/R Live streaming service in North America and was available through pay-per-view internationally.


=== Storylines ===
Fight for the Fallen comprised nine professional wrestling matches, including two on the pre-show, that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines, written by AEW's writers. Storylines were produced on The Young Bucks' YouTube series Being The Elite and Cody's Nightmare Family YouTube series The Road to Fight for the Fallen.
At Double or Nothing after Cody had defeated his brother Dustin Rhodes, he said that as an Executive Vice President of AEW, he had scheduled himself to have a tag team match against The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) at Fight for the Fallen. He said that he did not need just any partner, he needed his brother, to which Cody and Dustin embraced, confirming that The Young Bucks would face The Brotherhood (Cody and Dustin) at the event.
Just prior to the event, it was announced that The Dark Order (Evil Uno and Stu Grayson), Angélico and Jack Evans, and Jungle Boy and Luchasaurus would face off in a three-way tag team match at Fight for the Fallen with the winning team advancing to All Out on August 31 for an opportunity at a first round bye in the AEW World Tag Team Championship tournament.

== Reception ==
Jason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net described Fight for the Fallen as overall "a good show", although he thought that many matches suffered a bit for going long, and he felt that fatigue set in with a crowd that had been in the heat for over four hours.


== Aftermath ==
Fight for the Fallen would continue as an annual summer event for AEW, but held as special episodes of AEW's television programs Dynamite (2020–present), Rampage (2022–present), and Collision (2023–present).
