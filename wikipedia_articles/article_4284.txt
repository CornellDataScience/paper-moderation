== History ==
In 1992, the French entrepreneur François Pinault transferred his majority stake in Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR, renamed Kering in 2013) to his new company, Groupe Artémis, created as a family investment vehicle. Throughout the 1990s, he engaged in a series of prestigious acquisitions.
The 1993 Château Latour acquisition was the first of a series under the Artémis Domaines label. Artémis acquired the winery René Engel (Vosne-Romanée, renamed Domaine d'Eugénie) in 2006, the Château Grillet (Condrieu AOC) in 2011, 1/10 of an acre of the Grand Cru Le Montrachet vineyard from Château de Puligny-Montrachet in 2012, the Napa Valley Araujo Estate Wines (Calistoga, renamed Eisele Vineyard) in 2013, and the Clos du Tart in 2017.
Groupe Artémis has controlled the auction house Christie's since 1998. Artémis bought the news magazine Le Point in 1997, the Stade Rennais F.C. in 1998, the History-focused publisher Tallandier in 1999, the luxury cruise operator Ponant in 2015 and the Brittany-Japan fusion Breizh Café. The group launched the tech-focused investment fund Red River West in 2017. Groupe Artémis is an important shareholder in the couture houses Giambattista Valli since 2017 and Courrèges since 2018, and in the magazine Point de Vue (royal family news) since 2018.

Groupe Artémis acquired the Palazzo Grassi in Venice in 2005, which reopened in 2006 as the first exhibition site of the Pinault Collection, and the Punta della Dogana, also in Venice, in 2009. Both buildings were renovated and remodeled by the Japanese architect Ando Tadao. In August 2016, the Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo and Groupe Artémis jointly announced the relaunch of Bourse de Commerce, located in Paris, into a Pinault Collection-branded contemporary art museum. The new museum contains 32,000 square feet of exhibition floor remodeled by Tadao Ando. It opened in Autumn 2021.
In September 2023, it was announced Groupe Artémis had agreed to acquire a majority stake in Los Angeles-headquartered talent and sports agency, Creative Artists Agency from American private equity firm TPG.
