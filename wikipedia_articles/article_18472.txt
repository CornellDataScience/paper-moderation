== Early life ==
Jackson was born to Phil Jackson Sr. and the late Denise Jackson in Carol Stream, Illinois on April 22, 1996. Jackson was the youngest of three siblings. However, when Jackson was three years old, his mother, Denise, died from breast cancer. Jackson's father did remarry, and his stepmother is Veronica Jackson.
Jackson started playing football in second grade with the Carol Stream Youth Football Association Panthers because of Phil Jackson Jr., Justin's older brother, who began at the same time but in fourth grade. Phil Jackson Jr. ended up going to Northwest Missouri State, winning three Division II national championships. According to his father, Jackson dominated on the field in his youth.
Jackson attended Glenbard North High School, where he played high school football alongside his brother during sophomore year. Jackson did well in school, and in sports. He was a three-sport high school athlete with a nearly 5.0 grade point average. Jackson played football, basketball, and track in high school. Jackson holds the Glenbard North record for career rushing yards and ranks sixth all-time in IHSA history for career rushing yards (6,531 yards) and seventh all-time in rushing touchdowns with 85. As a junior in 2012, Jackson competed in the state finals against Mount Carmel high school. In that game he returned an interception over 79 yards for a touchdown; but was held to 65 yards rushing on 26 carries. Mount Carmel won the game 28–14.

He finished the 2013 season with 3,171 rushing yards in 11 games, the second most in a single season in IHSA history; the 3-seeded Panthers were upset in the second round of the playoffs by 6-seed and eventual 8A semifinalist Stevenson High School (Lincolnshire, Illinois), otherwise Jackson would have had up to three more games to rush for 155 yards for the Illinois single-season record. Jackson was also a member of the Honor Roll and French Honors Society.
