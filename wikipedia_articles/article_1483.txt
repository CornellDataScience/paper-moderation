== History ==


=== Background ===
Hadley was founded in 1920 by William A. Hadley.
When he lost his sight at the age of 55, William Hadley faced many challenges. A former high school teacher with a lifelong passion for reading, Hadley wanted to learn braille. He was frustrated, however in his search for a teacher, so he taught himself braille instead.


=== Founding ===
Hadley's dream was to share his newfound skills with others like him, empowering them to thrive as he had. Together with Dr. E.V.L. Brown, an ophthalmologist and neighbor, Hadley found a way to reach others through the mail.
The Hadley Correspondence School and the "braille by mail" curriculum were launched in 1920. The very first student, a woman in Kansas, had lost her sight later in life, too, and she wanted to continue reading. She mailed her lessons to Hadley, and he corrected and returned them along with notes of help and encouragement.
Dr. Brown was also critical to the founding and success of Hadley. He worked to build and manage an organization that could sustain itself while offering education free of charge. In 1922, Dr. Brown was appointed to be Hadley's first President of the board of trustees and would serve in this role until his death in 1953.


=== Emerging Technology ===
By the early 1960s, Hadley was exploring new approaches to distance learning, producing braille books and audio recordings from its building in downtown Winnetka, for distribution to a growing population of visually impaired people across the country. More recently, Hadley has added the production of videos that are available on its website.


== Hadley Today ==
In July 2020, Hadley revamped its online learning platform. The updated learning hub offers free workshops on a variety of practical topics. Workshops are delivered online or through the mail in audio or print. In addition, Hadley's call-in discussion groups offer live support from experts and a chance to connect and learn from peers.
