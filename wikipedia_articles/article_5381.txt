== History ==
William Henry Fitchett was secretary of a committee formed in 1879 to start a secondary school for girls.
MLC was founded on its current campus in Kew on 14 February 1882 as a modern school of the first order, with buildings that formed a collegiate institution for girls unsurpassed in the colonies. It was the first Australian girls' school established by the Wesleyan Methodists and Fitchett was the first principal. The goal of its founders was to provide a high-class Christian education for girls, comparable with that provided elsewhere for boys. As the first Australian girls' school established by the Wesleyan Methodists, MLC attracted boarders from all Australian colonies.
In 1990, MLC became the first school in the world to introduce laptop computers for all students from Year 5 to Year 12. In 1991, MLC Marshmead opened, providing Year 9 students with an eight-week residential experience with a focus on outdoor education.
In 2001, The Sun-Herald reported a 1988 study which ranked MLC third in Australia's top ten girls' schools, based on the number of its alumni mentioned in the Who's Who in Australia (a listing of notable Australians).[a] In 2002, MLC won the title of 'Australian School of the Year', as published in The Australian newspaper.


== Principals ==
There have been a total of nine principals, or formerly headmasters, of MLC since the school was founded in 1882.


== House system ==
As with most Australian schools, MLC has a house system through which students partake in inter-house competitions and activities. The college currently has five houses:

Berry – Colour: Purple, Mascot: Turtle.
Cato – Colour: Blue, Mascot: Bear.

Krome – Colour: Green, Mascot: Frog

In the past, there was a Tiddeman house (colour red), which was specifically for boarders.

== Controversy ==
In September 2012 the school board sacked the then principal of 15 years, Rosa Storelli, leading to calls by Storelli plus many parents and Old Collegians for the board's dismissal. There were also protests outside the school by parents and students. The action by the board was made possible by changes to the school's constitution. This became a cautionary tale for other independent schools in Australia about the relationship between principals and the boards of those schools and the power-sharing relationships among the various stakeholders. Rosa Storelli subsequently joined La Trobe University as an adjunct professor.
