Auburn is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,946 at the 2020 census, up from 4,953 at the 2010 census.


== History ==
Auburn was originally settled by Native Americans in 1624. It was a fishing settlement called by Native Americans "Massabesic" (the current name of the town's largest lake). British settlers arrived in the area in 1720 and made peace with the Natives until the French and Indian War. The Massabesic settlement was destroyed, and the nearby town of Chester claimed the land. It was known as "Chester Woods", "Chester West Parish", "Long Meadow", and then Auburn. Auburn became an independent town on June 25, 1845, with a population of 1,200 people. As with Auburn, Maine, Auburn, Massachusetts, and Auburn, New York, the name is from Oliver Goldsmith's popular 18th-century poem, "The Deserted Village", which begins:

Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain,
Where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain
Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,
And parting summer's lingering blooms delayed
Auburn was served by the Concord and Portsmouth Railroad, which later became the Portsmouth Branch of the Boston & Maine Railroad. Auburn was home to a small passenger depot at one time, but by the mid 1900s most rail activity was through traffic, as Auburn had few on-line industries. The last freight trains passed through in the early 1980s. The track was abandoned in 1982 and subsequently torn up between 1983 and 1985.


== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 28.8 square miles (74.6 km2), of which 25.4 square miles (65.7 km2) are land and 3.5 square miles (9.0 km2), or 12.01%, are water. Massabesic Lake, located in the western part of Auburn and the eastern part of Manchester, is the largest body of water in Auburn and serves as the public water supply for Manchester. The lake is fed by numerous tributaries, most notable being Sucker Brook, which enters the northeastern end of the lake near the Auburn town center and itself drains several lakes, including Tower Hill Pond, Clark Pond, and Little Massabesic Lake. Cohas Brook flows through the eastern portion of Auburn and eventually (in Manchester) receives the outflow of Massabesic Lake before flowing west to the Merrimack River. Auburn lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed. Three hills, all overlooking Massabesic Lake, can lay potential claim to being Auburn's highest point: Mount Miner, at 582 feet (177 m) above sea level, located north of the lake; Mine Hill, greater than 580 ft (177 m), above the east shore; and Mount Misery, greater than 580 feet, to the southeast.

== Attractions ==
Lake Massabesic covers over 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) in Auburn and Manchester and serves as the public water supply for the city of Manchester. Half of the lake (the half farthest from the public water intake) is used for less-intrusive types of boating. No swimming or other contact between users and water is allowed. Devil's Den is a small cave east of Massabesic Lake. The Massabesic Audubon Center is in central Auburn, occupying Battery Point on the lake. The Griffin Mill Dam along Little Massabesic Brook-Sucker Brook is in the northeastern part of the town.


== Events and festivals ==


=== Lake Massabesic Duck Race ===
Every year, the Auburn Historical Association hosts an annual Duck Race on Hooksett Road near a river that flows into Lake Massabesic. The main event starts at the Hooksett road bridge over the Little Massabesic Brook-Sucker Brook where a truck dumps thousands of yellow rubber ducks into the brook,lined with straight yellow floating tubes, and the race ends at a finish line on the left side of the Griffin Mill Bridge, past the waterfall. People buy individual ducks, with prizes going to the owners of the "fastest" ducks to reach the finish line. The event attracts thousands of onlookers each year, to partake in the selection of goods offered at rented booths and/or to watch the ducks leisurely float down the river. There are  games for younger kids (usually provided by Auburn Village School volunteers). Visitors are able to access the Griffin Free Public Library, or browse the related booths parked in the Griffin Free Public Library's parking lot. 
An official pie contest happens at a booth in the Duck race, with 1st, 2nd,and 3rd place winner's getting special clay pie trays.


=== Yacht Sail Boating Club race ===
Every Sunday, sometimes also during the week, the Yacht Sail Boating Club hosts a sailboat race. Members of the club start on the northern shore of Massabesic Lake, and it ends after going 3 laps around the lake. Many visitors enjoy watching the races from their kayaks, sailboats, and canoes, or at Battery Point, the northernmost point on the Massabesic Peninsula.


=== Book sale ===
The last weekend in July, the Griffin Free Public Library holds a huge book sale at the Auburn Village School.  Approximately 10,000 books and games are sold, with all proceeds benefiting the library's programs.
