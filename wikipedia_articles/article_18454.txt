=== Kangxi era ===
The future Imperial Noble Consort Quehui was born in 1668. It is not known when lady Tunggiya entered the Forbidden City; historical records state that she was present in 1697 as a consort. By that year, Empress Xiaoyiren, Noble Consort Wenxi and Imperial Noble Consort Jingmin had died, leaving imperial harem without de iure head. Kangxi Emperor didn't instate a new empress, instead granted lady Tunggiya the title "Noble Consort" (贵妃) in January 1701. As she was the only noble consort, she didn't receive any honorific name. In 1706, she received 150 lard fishes, while Empress Dowager Renxian received 50 sesame oil fishes. From 1711, Lady Tunggiya and Consort He were tasked with raising Hongli, a son of Prince Yong of the First Rank, Yinzhen.


=== Yongzheng era ===
After the enthronement of the Yongzheng Emperor in 1722, Lady Tong was promoted to "Imperial Noble Consort" (皇贵妃), but the promotion ceremony was delayed until July 1724 due to national mourning.


=== Qianlong era ===
In 1736, she was given a title "Dowager Imperial Noble Consort Shouqi" (寿祺皇贵妃; "shouqi" meaning "long-living and auspicious"). Imperial Noble Consort Shouqi resided in Palace of Tranquil Longevity together with four grand dowager consorts.
Imperial Noble Consort Shouqi died on 24 April 1743 in her residence. She was granted posthumous title "Imperial Noble Consort Quehui" (悫惠皇贵妃; "quehui" meaning "honest and kind").
