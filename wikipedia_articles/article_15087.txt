== Views and opinions ==
In a Haaretz op-ed, "What does 'Death to Israel' mean to you?", Burston is critical of "progressives" who claim to support the inalienable rights of human beings over nationalism, but fail to see Israelis as people.
In 2011, Burston drew issue with "the idea that formally Muslim states are acceptable, where a Jewish state is not."
In 2015, however, Burston wrote that Israeli policy now amounts to apartheid, stating: "I used to be one of those people who took issue with the label of apartheid as applied to Israel... Not anymore... Our Israel is what it has become: Apartheid."
In December 2023, Burston wrote that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is responsible for the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war.

In 2006, Search for Common Ground gave Burston its Eliav-Sartawi Award for Middle East Journalism.
