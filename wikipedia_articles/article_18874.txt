== Synopsis ==
After they get cut off welfare, Donner (Jason Lee) leads four of his jobless, penniless roommates spend their last remaining money on a cover charge for a party and get high. After getting evicted, they all embark on a journey to find a cabin in the woods that belongs to his uncle. They get lost and stranded in the woods, without food or water or their bearings when their van breaks down. He eventually reveals to his roommates that the search for the cabin is really a search for Sasquatch. They, of course, think he's crazy. There is conflict. Donner insists he is onto something, but the others just write him off. But to make matters worse, they uncover all kinds of bizarre and dangerous activity as they wander through the woods in search of not only Bigfoot himself but any hope of a future. Eventually, Donner does find Bigfoot and has a campfire with him (as well as others).

== Production notes ==
While making Mallrats, Kevin Smith met Canadian Film Threat journalist Malcolm Ingram and his friend Matt Gissing; the three decided to make Drawing Flies, the title of which is based on a Soundgarden song from the album Badmotorfinger. Along with much of the cast of Mallrats, Smith headed up to the Canadian wilderness and made the film. The same camera and type of film stock that was used to film Clerks was used to film Drawing Flies. The film was only featured at a few film festivals before it was given a DVD release in 2002.  Kevin Smith wears his "Silent Bob" outfit from Mallrats and is credited as "Silent Bob", although the character is referred to as "John". He never utters a line.
Jason Lee had only appeared in Mallrats. He later said: "nobodyâ€™s seen that film, really, but that film really marked a turning point for me in that I thought, Okay, regardless of what happens with this movie, this is the second movie for me. If I can pull this off, then I'll be an actor."
