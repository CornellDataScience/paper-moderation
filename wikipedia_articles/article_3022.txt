A Shot at Love II with Tila Tequila is an American reality television dating game show. It is the follow-up season to A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila. The series is a bisexual-themed dating competition where 15 hetero males and 15 lesbian females live in a house with Tila Tequila and compete for her attention and affection. The contestants, unlike in season 1, are aware of Tequila's bisexuality. The winner of this season was contestant Kristy Morgan, who declined her "shot at love", stating she was not ready for a relationship with a woman.
A spin-off of the series entitled A Double Shot at Love featuring the bisexual "ikki twins" premiered on December 9, 2008. Tequila had previously confirmed on her official website that she would not be a part of the show's third season, but will instead be featured in a show focusing on her daily life.
