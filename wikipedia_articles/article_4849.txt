Throughout most of its history, Camden has been controlled outright by the Labour Party. During that control, Labour's share of the seats has fluctuated significantly. The below chart includes only councillors, not aldermen prior to their abolition in 1978; the presence of aldermen never affected the overall control of the council.

== Wards ==

Wards were established for Camden when it came into existence on 1 April 1965. The first elections of ward councillors took place in 1964. These boundaries were also used for the 1968, 1971 and 1974 elections. For the 1978 elections the ward boundaries were revised in Camden. These boundaries were then also used at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 elections.
For the May 1994 elections there were some minor adjustments to London borough boundaries, which caused some Camden wards to have small changes in area and population. These boundaries were also used at the 1998 elections. New ward boundaries came into effect at the May 2002 elections. They were also used at the 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 elections.
Camden was subject to a boundary review in 2020. In February 2020, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England released its final recommendations that the borough should be divided into 15 three-member wards and 5 two-member wards. The wards were approved by Parliament in October 2020, and were first used at the 2022 election.
The new wards from May 2022 are:

== Aldermen ==
Aldermen were elected by the council, not the electorate, and had full voting rights. Each council included aldermen, to a maximum of one sixth of the councillors. The Local Government Act 1972 abolished Aldermen with voting rights with effect from 1978 in the London borough councils. Since 1978, the title has been used in an honorary capacity.
