Moses was selected by the Washington Redskins in the third round (66th overall) of the 2014 NFL draft. He signed a four-year, $3.05 million contract on May 29, 2014. He started only one game that season and was placed on injured reserve that December because of a lisfranc injury.
During training camp of his second season in 2015, Moses won the starting right tackle job despite initial belief that new first round draft pick, Brandon Scherff, would win the job. Scherff instead became the starting right guard. On April 27, 2017, Moses signed a five-year contract extension with the Redskins.
In Week 10 of the 2020 season, Moses filled in at left tackle after Cornelius Lucas left in the second half of the game with an injury. The following week, Moses switched over and started at left tackle in the win against the Cincinnati Bengals. In Week 13, Moses returned to playing right tackle after Lucas was able to return. He was released on May 20, 2021.
