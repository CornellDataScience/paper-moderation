The 2018 Campeonato Carioca de Futebol was the 115th edition of the top tier of football  of FFERJ (Federação de Futebol do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, or Rio de Janeiro State Football Federation). The top four teams in the final standings of the tournament not otherwise qualified competed in the 2019 Copa do Brasil. The top three teams not competing in any level of the national Campeonato Brasileiro qualified for the 2019 Brasileiro Série D. 
The format remained unchanged from the 2017 edition. In the First Round, six teams played a round-robin tournament, with the top two teams qualified for the main competition and the bottom four entering the Relegation Round. The main competition was divided into two tournaments, the Taça Guanabara and Taça Rio, each with two 6-team groups. The top two placed teams in each of the groups qualified to contest the state title. The top four teams in the final standings qualified automatically for the Final Round (the Taça Guanabara and Taça Rio champions). The Final Round was a knockout-style playoff with a two-legged final played at the Maracanã Stadium. in Macaé was punished with the loss of 26 points by TJD-RJ by irregular escalation of left-side Luke Gabriel in six matches of the Taça Rio.
