Adénon was born in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. He started his career with Ivorian side ASEC Mimosas, moving to France with Le Mans FC in 2008. He made his senior debut with Le Mans in a Ligue 1 match against AS Nancy on 19 October 2008. He joined Ligue 2 side SC Bastia on loan for the 2009–10 season on 3 July 2009.

In July 2020, Adénon returned to France with US Avranches, re-uniting with manager Frédéric Reculeau, who had given him a chance at Luçon.
