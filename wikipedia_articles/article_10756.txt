== History ==
Records in 1765 show that John Brown, John McGillvary, William Molyneaux and William Trowin petitioned English authorities for 1,400 acres (570 ha) south of the Satilla River. They were granted the land named Pile's Bluff, which historians believe to be near Woodbine.
A tract of land was granted to Anton Cunning by the state in 1808. It became known as the Woodbine Plantation. Luke John Bailey purchased it in 1835 and held it through the Civil War, during which the house was burned by Union troops. James King Bedell acquired the property, constructed a new house, and restored the plantation. The railroad entered Camden County in 1893, and Bedell sold a right-of-way across his land, but required that the first rail community be named "Woodbine".
Woodbine was incorporated as a town on August 13, 1908, and the word is the common English name for the honeysuckle, Lonicera. The town grew more after the Atlantic Coastal Highway was constructed during 1927 and the county seat relocated there the following year. Woodbine re-incorporated as a city in 1953.
On the morning of February 3, 1971, the Thiokol Chemical Corporation, a factory that made flares for soldiers fighting in Vietnam, exploded. Twenty-eight employees of the factory, predominantly Black women, were killed after a flame in a small building, according to court records, triggered a massive explosion. The blast blew pieces of the building almost a mile away, left more than 50 other people injured.
