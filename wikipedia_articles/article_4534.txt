United Russia retained its overwhelming  majority in the State Assembly, winning 54% of the vote and all 30 single-mandate constituencies. Liberal Democratic Party of Russia recorded gains after its alliance with local Party of Business and came second with 18%, while Communist Party of the Russian Federation suffered a crushing defeat (14%), losing six of its seven seats.

== Electoral system ==
Under current election laws, the State Assembly is elected for a term of five years, with parallel voting. 11 seats are elected by party-list proportional representation with a 5% electoral threshold, with the other half elected in 30 single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. Seats in the proportional part are allocated using the Imperiali quota, modified to ensure that every party list, which passes the threshold, receives at least one mandate.
