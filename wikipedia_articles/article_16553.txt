== Plot ==
Zamindar Bhujanga Rao has two sons: Raghavendra / Raghu & Nagendra / Naagu. Raghu is the mentally challenged son of Zamindar from his first wife. After the death of his wife, Zamidar remarries vainglory Rajeswari and Nagendra is their son. Due to the mollycoddling of his mother, Naagu turns into a narcissist, and he mercilessly flogs his sibling. Once Naagu visits their village, he tyrannizes the peasants, when intrepid Padmavati / Padma impedes his slave-driving attitude. Listening to this, Zamindar walks to Padma, declares her the right choice for Naagu's amendment, and fixes the alliance. However, Rajeswari & Naagu vetoed it. Thus, to uphold his prestige, Zamindar gets Padma married with Raghu. At the last moment, the truth comes out about Raghu's condition but Padma accepts him, as a woman of virtue. From there, she becomes aware of Rajeswari & Naagu's savagery to Raghu and shows defiance. Parallelly, it is made known that the old maid in the household who acted as a foster mother to Raghu by raising him, unknowingly gave him opium in his childhood leading to his mental condition. Doctor says he can be cured but Nagu sways him with money to not treat Raghu. Following this, Padma, with austerity and tenacity, molds her husband into a civilized person. 
Zamindar is amazed after seeing this change and entrusts Raghu with the family tasks, which begrudge Naagu. So, he menaces his father for his share, which Rajeswari also bolsters. Tragically, Zamindar dies in that mishap by falling down a flight of stairs. Before leaving his breath, he consigns totality to Raghu. Hereupon, Rajeswari is pissed off and about to quit. Thus, Raghu surrenders all assets to her and shifts to their village with Padma. After that, Naagu burns cash for his vices and puppets his mother. Plus, he fits his paramour Neelaveni & her family at home, which Rajeswari goes against. Naagu seizes her authority, and she receives a slap from him. Naagu also pesters the farmers for the lease arrears, and they bestow it to Raghu, avowing him as proprietor. Being conscious of it, outraged Naagu heads to the village to shoot his brother. Parallelly, Raghu reaches Rajeswari and hands over the amount to her. At this, she realizes her mistake, pleads pardon, and accompanies him. On the other hand, Naagu starts raging on the farmers when Raghu arrives and drops the money before him. Forthwith, enraged Rajeswari is about to hit Naagu, which Padma hinders. At last, remorseful, Naagu reforms seeing the integrity of Raghu & Padma. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the family's reunion.
