== History ==
The first major U.S. federal highway in early territorial Florida, Bellamy Road, was constructed in the 1820s–1830s and passed through Waldo from around Lake Santa Fe to the east and on towards the Santa Fe River in the west, where it passed over the river on a natural land bridge at modern O'Leno State Park. In 1853, the Florida Legislature chartered the Florida Railroad to build a line from Fernandina Beach to Tampa, with a branch running to Cedar Key. U.S. Senator David Levy Yulee, president and chief stockholder of the Florida Railroad, made the decision to build the Cedar Key branch first. The section up to Gainesville was completed by 1859, with the intersection of Bellamy Road and the Florida Railroad named Waldo Station, after Senator Yulee's friend, Benjamin Waldo, a doctor and politician. In 1876, the railroad branch from Waldo to Ocala was completed.
The City of Waldo was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1907.

== Speed trap designation ==
In August 1995, the American Automobile Association (AAA) declared Waldo, and the neighboring city of Lawtey, as "speed traps" and urged motorists to choose alternate routes instead of driving through the two cities. On September 2, 2014, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began an investigation of Waldo's ticketing following allegations of ticketing quotas, with one police chief having been suspended for a two-week period. On October 1, 2014, the City Council voted 4–1 to disband the city's police department. The former chief of the disbanded Waldo Police Department was cleared of any wrongdoing after an investigation by the Florida Criminal Justice Standards & Training Commission (CJSTC). In a letter to the Waldo City Manager, the CJSTC wrote, "The decision is based upon the finding that insufficient grounds exist under the guidelines of Chapter 943.1395, Florida Statutes, to pursue any disciplinary action by the commission." This event led to then-Florida Governor Rick Scott to sign a bill (SB 264) which better defined the ban on ticket quotas. Waldo is somewhat unique in that unlike most other speed trap towns, "...the speed trap in Waldo, Florida, was brought down not by outside pressure but from the inside", as reported in May 2022 by Reason magazine.
In August 2018, the AAA officially lifted the designation of "speed trap" for the city of Waldo.
