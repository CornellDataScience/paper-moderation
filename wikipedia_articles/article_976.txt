== History ==
The 9th Field Artillery Regiment was formed from elements of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment in Hawaii in 1916. By 1919, the regiment was stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The regiment was inactivated there on 1 September 1921. Although the regimental headquarters was inactive from 1921 through 1927, the regiment's 1st Battalion was active from 1922 to 1927, with elements at Fort Des Moines, Iowa and Fort Riley, Kansas. Although inactive, the regiment was reassigned from the 7th Division to the 9th Division in 1927. The regiment was reorganized as a 75mm gun regiment in 1927 in the Seventh Corps Area, and Organized Reserve personnel assigned to the unit trained at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin in 1927 and at Fort Riley, Kansas in 1928–9. In 1930, the regiment was allotted to the Fourth Corps Area, reassigned from the 9th Division to the 4th Division, and changed into a motorized 155mm howitzer unit, but never organized in the Fourth Corps Area. The regiment's 1st Battalion was activated in 1930 at Fort Lewis, Washington. In 1933, the regiment was withdrawn from the Fourth Corps Area and allotted to the 9th Corps Area, and reassigned from the 4th Division to the 3rd Division. The regiment's 2nd Battalion was activated in 1939, joining the 1st Battalion at Fort Lewis. The 3rd Battalion was disbanded in 1939 (apparently without ever being organized). On 1 October 1940, the regiment was reorganized as the 9th Field Artillery Battalion as part of the Army's conversion to triangular divisions which eliminated field artillery regiments from the force structure in favor of independent battalions.


=== World War II ===
The 9th Field Artillery Battalion departed Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation, Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 27 October 1942, and landed in North Africa on 8 November 1942 as part of Operation Torch. As the division artillery's 155mm general support unit, one battery of the battalion landed with each regimental landing group.
