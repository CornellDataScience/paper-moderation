=== 2020s ===
The Tigers' first season was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Tigers had started 19–8 overall and 5–1 in ACC play before the season was cancelled by Clemson and the ACC.  The NCAA tournament was also canceled. 2021 was Clemson's first full season as a program and they finished 44–8 overall, with a 29–5 record in ACC play.  They won the regular season championship, and made the final of the ACC tournament but fell short in the final, losing to Duke.  They could not advance past the Regional in the NCAA Tournament.  They were placed in a Regional with SEC champion Alabama and lost both games against the Crimson Tide.  The program's success would continue in 2022 as they would finish 14–10 in ACC play to finish in fifth place.  Despite their lower seed, they again reached the final of the ACC tournament, but could not overcome Florida State in the Final.  They were selected to host a regional in the NCAA Tournament and won three games without allowing a run, to advance to the Super Regional.  During the 2023 season, Clemson had its first perfect game in program history.  Valerie Cagle recorded the perfect game by retiring all fifteen batters she faced in an 18–0 (5 inning) win over Mercer. The 2024 season, was a down season by Clemson's lofty standards. The team finished with its lowest overall win total in a full season. However, they did keep their streak of NCAA tournament appearances alive, but did not advance past the regional round.
