The President of the United States can establish a national monument by presidential proclamation, and the United States Congress can by legislation. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorized the president to proclaim "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest" as national monuments.
Other protective national designations, including those of the National Park Service, must be created by congressional legislation.


== Interior Department memorandum ==
In a 2010 "Not for Release" memorandum by the United States Department of the Interior, 14 areas were listed in the "Prospective Conservation Designation" attachment as "good candidates for National Monument designation under the Antiquities Act". Those areas are included in the lists below, shaded bluish-green.
In subsequent attachments in the same draft, "areas worthy of protection that are ineligible for Monument Designation and unlikely to receive legislative protection in the near term" and "cost estimates" of "high priority land-rationalization efforts" were listed.


== Monuments for All Campaign ==
During the Biden Administration, coalitions of numerous conservation, Native American, and Black groups coalesced to form the Monuments for All campaign, to coincide with the "America the Beautiful" and "30x30" initiatives from the Biden Administration. These groups called on President Biden to designate numerous National Monuments under the Antiquities Act, many from the 2010 Memorandum that were not designated by President Obama. These groups successfully lobbied for the restoration of Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument from President Trump's cuts, as well as Avi Kwa Ame National Monument and Castner Range, among others. The monuments still in this campaign are colored blue below.
