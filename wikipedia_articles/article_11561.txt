Warren S. Brown (born September 8, 1944) is a professor of psychology in the Graduate School of Psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary and the founding director of the Travis Research Institute. Brown received his doctorate in Experimental Physiological Psychology from the University of Southern California (1971). Prior to Fuller, Brown spent 11 years as a research scientist at the UCLA Brain Research Institute. He was a founding member of the National Organization for Disorders of the Corpus Callosum, the International Research Consortium on the Corpus Callosum and Cerebral Connectivity (IRC5), and the International Society for Science and Religion. The "Warren and Janet Brown Scholarship", given at Fuller to support students in neuropsychological research, was created to honor Brown and his late wife.


== Neuropsychological research ==
Warren Brown is involved in experimental neuropsychological research related to functions of the corpus callosum of the brain and its relationship to higher cognitive processes in humans. In particular, he has been studying the implications of agenesis of the corpus callosum (i.e., congenital absence of the corpus callosum, the pathway that connects the right and left hemispheres).  Brown has been interested in the implications of this disorder for mental abilities and social awareness. Over the last 30+ years his lab has conducted one of the largest studies accomplished thus far (both in number of subjects and depth of testing) on cognitive and social disabilities of individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum. He has authored or coauthored over 100 scholarly articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals; 60 other articles and chapters in edited scholarly books; and over 200 presentations at scientific meetings. Over the last several years, Brown and his students have also studied of the cognitive and psychosocial abilities of adults who had a hemispherectomy in childhood.
