=== Poetry ===
Jones released his debut poetry chapbook in 2011. Titled When the Only Light is Fire, it was the top-selling book in the Gay Poetry category on Amazon for several weeks.
In 2014, Jones published his first full-length poetry collection, Prelude to Bruise. NPR called it "brilliant, unsparing," "visceral and affecting." The Kenyon Review said the work "evokes a perilous, often mythic, eroticism within a brutalizing context of violence." TIME Magazine recommended it as "an engrossing read best consumed in as few sittings as possible." It was a 2014 finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for poetry.
In September 2022, Jones published another poetry collection, Alive at the End of the World.
Jones has been a winner of the Pushcart Prize, the Joyce Osterwell Award for Poetry from the PEN Literary Awards, and the Stonewall Book Award-Barbara Gittings Award for Literature, and a nominee for the 2014 Lambda Literary Award for Gay Poetry. Jones has been featured on PBS NewsHour's poetry series and on So Popular! with Janet Mock on MSNBC. He was featured on the cover of Hello Mr. in 2015.

His memoir How We Fight for Our Lives was published by Simon & Schuster in 2019. The New Yorker called the book's tone and content "urgent, immediate, matter of fact". NPR called it an "outstanding memoir" with "elements that profoundly connect him to poetry" and to "many of us who grew up dreaming of a chance at upward social mobility". The book won the Kirkus Prize for Nonfiction in 2019 and a Lambda Literary Award in 2020.
