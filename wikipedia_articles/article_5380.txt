Inside is the debut album by alternative rock musician Matthew Sweet.  It was released on Columbia Records in 1986. Sweet was dropped from the label after the album's release, and would not put out another record for three years.


== Production ==
The album was recorded in multiple studios with a large number of producers and musicians, including Bernie Worrell, Chris Stamey, Scott Litt, Don Dixon, and Aimee Mann, among others.


== Critical reception ==
Trouser Press called the album "a bit like R.E.M. and early dB’s doing sincere power-pop with keyboards." The Rolling Stone Album Guide wrote that the songs "come across like the snappy work of a brainy Tommy James." The Spin Alternative Record Guide called Inside "notable only because it features ten different producers, none of whom have a clue what to do with Sweet's music." The Chicago Reader called it "tuneful and pleasant but ... sunk by the electropop, machine-driven production Sweet was pursuing."
