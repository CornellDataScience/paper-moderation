John W. Donohue, AIA (1869–1941) was an American architect who was active in Western Massachusetts during the first half of the 20th century.


== Life and career ==
John William Donohue was born May 30, 1868, in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Florence J. Donohue and Mary (Walsh) Donohue. His father was a master mason for the Boston and Albany Railroad, and built the headquarters of the railroad in Springfield. Donohue was educated in the Springfield public schools. After graduating from high school in 1887 he entered the civil engineering office of the Boston and Albany before becoming associated with local architect Francis R. Richmond. After seven years with Richmond he opened his own office. Though he was an architect with a general practice, he was appointed architect of the Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts, and in that role was architect for over twenty Catholic churches in the Springfield diocese, which then also included the territory of the Worcester diocese, in addition to many schools, hospitals and other buildings.
Donohue was associated with architect Burton E. Geckler from 1905 until his retirement in the 1930s. Geckler joined Donohue as a draftsman and later practiced in the same office as an architect. They mostly worked on their projects independently, but collaborated on some projects.
Donohue joined the American Institute of Architects in 1908 and remained a member until his death.


== Personal life ==
Donohue lived at 32 Plainfield Street in Springfield, which has been demolished. He was a parishioner of the R. C. Church of the Sacred Heart in Springfield.
Donohue died March 4, 1941, at home at the age of 72.
