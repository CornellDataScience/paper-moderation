== History ==

Neuenstadt was originally a settlement known as Helmbund which was first mentioned in records as early in 797 A.D. Helmbund stood in the meadows of Brettach. It is believed that the settlement moved a kilometer away at some time around the beginning of the 14th century to avoid flooding. Since then it has stood on higher ground between the Kocher and Brettach rivers. This gave rise to name New Town, or "Neue Stadt" in German. The hamlet of Helmbund subsequently all but disappeared with only the scattered ruins of the Gothic church of Helmbund remaining. Neuenstadt first fell under the reign of the rulers of Weinsberg whose lineage came to an end in 1507. As a result, it was originally a town from the Electorate of the Palatinate before falling into the area of Württemberg in 1504. In the 17th and 18th century the Württemberg-Neuenstadt branch line of the ducal house of Württemberg took up residence in Neuenstadt castle until the male lineage of dukes died out in 1742.
Towards the end of the Second World War the fortified stronghold of Neuenstadt came under heavy fire from allied forces. In April 1945, nearly 80% of Neuenstadt old town was destroyed. During fighting, one of the wires holding up the legendary lime tree that stood outside the gates of the town, which had given the town part of its name in medieval times, was torn into pieces. Subsequently, a violent storm shattered the tree. Since then, fragments of live wood, suitable for 'cuttings', were garnered, grown until rooted then large enough to hold a structure, a kind of pergola in an attractive lime garden, which now surrounds the bottom of the tree trunk that has survived. This is so substantial it gives some idea of just how enormous the original tree would have been.

=== Coat of arms and flag ===
The Neuenstadt coat of arms depicts two silver shields over a silver helmet on a blue background. Blue and white are the town’s official colours.
The coat of arms originate from a seal first used in the late 13th century. The colours have remained unchanged since 1535. The shields are believed to represent the two founders of the “new town” – the Lords of Weinsberg – who used three silver shields on a red background as their coat of arms. The helmet (German:‘Helm’) points to the origins of the town, the now lost settlement of Helmbund.

== People, culture and architecture ==


=== Architecture ===
From 1618 to 1781 Neuenstadt Renaissance Castle was residence to the Württemberg-Neuenstadt branch line of the royal house of Württemberg. The castle was built between 1559 and 1565 on the fortification walls of the Lords of Weinsberg’s castle.
The evangelical Nikolaus Church dates back to the 16th century. Under the chancel is a crypt which was used as a burial vault between 1659 and 1781 for the three Dukes of Württemberg-Neuenstadt.
The castle and church join together to form the upper Gate Tower which was built in 1300 and renewed in 1703. The current tower was reconstructed following a fire in 1831.
A number of historical timber-framed buildings still stand in Neuenstadt old town including the Old Apothecary and gate, dating back to 1801, the rectory from 1749 and the Old Forestry Commission office.
Until April 1945 a huge lime tree stood near the castle outside the Gate Tower. It was reputed to be 1000 years old and lent the town its alternative name of Neuenstadt of the Great Lime Tree. The lime was destroyed by allied bombing during fighting near the end of the Second World War, but locals people found live shoots from the destroyed tree and grew new lime trees around the former lime. Their branches now form a shady garden, supported by approx 100 stone pillars donated by local citizens and aristocrats. The pillars in the garden were renovated between 1962 and 1981 and now bear the coats of arms of the manor houses of the Lords of Ehrenberg, the Lords of Berlichingen and the Lords of Gemmingen from 1557.
