Cathay Pacific City (Chinese: 國泰城; Jyutping: gwok3 taai3 sing4), often referred as Cathay City, is the headquarters of Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's flag-carrying airline. It is located at Hong Kong International Airport, on the south side.


== History ==
The airline built Cathay Pacific City so that all central employees could work in one location.
The facility was initially to cost $3.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$452.8 million as of 1995). The plans called for about 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of office space on 3.3 hectares (8.2 acres) of land. In 1995 the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) agreed to lease the site to the airline.
The headquarters opened in 1998. The topping out ceremony was held on 17 February 1998. Cathay Pacific City was scheduled to be built in increments between April and September 1998. It was scheduled to open in July, when Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok was to open. It was scheduled to have over 3,000 employees. The airline's move to the centre was scheduled to begin in June. On 6 July, operational departments were scheduled to be ready for the airport. In the second half of 1998 the rest of the airline was scheduled to move in. Previously the airline's headquarters were at Swire House, a building in Central named after the airline's parent company. The architects were Llewelyn-Davies, who began design work in May 1995. Simon Jackson and Associates outfitted the hotel interiors. Cathay Pacific City had a cost of 4.9 billion Hong Kong dollars.
