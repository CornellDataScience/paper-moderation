Lax'n'Busto are a pop-rock group formed in 1986 in El Vendrell, Catalonia, Spain.


== History ==
In 1989 the group published their first album: Vas de punt?... o què!!! The album was re-released in both in 1992 and 1994, without the song "Carme Flavià!" This song was banned for insulting the titular individual.
Lax'n'Busto released their second album in 1991, including the single "Miami Beach." The following year, they released their third album, Qui ets tu? (Who are you?), which sold 20,000 copies in a few days.
In 1995 the band released their third album, La caixa que puja i baixa. One year later, they recorded this album live under the name A l'auditori. The band also changed managers during this year.
Lax'n'Busto's 1998 album is called Sí. Two years later, they released the album Llença't (Launch yourself). During the same year, they performed more than 50 concerts.
In 2004 they moved their discography archives from DiscMedi to Música Global.
Two years later, Pemi Fortuny Soler left the group, and Salva Racero replaced him as a singer. They recorded their new album, with help from Sylvia Massy, in California.
The album Relax, recorded in the United States and published in 2007, was the eighteenth-most-sold album of the year in Spain, according to the Promusicae ranking, which is the best such performance by a Catalan-language album. The following year, the album Objectiu: La Lluna (Destination: the Moon) wwas released. This album was recorded in the studios of La Casamurada between the August and September of the same year. Once again, Sylvia Massy produced the album.
In July of 2010, they performed at the Teatre Àngel Guimerà in El Vendrell with the Orquestra de Cambra de l'Empordà. 18 songs were recorded live at these concerts, which comprise the tracks on the CD Simfònic.
In 2013, the CD Tot és més senzill was released. These songs have a more personal perspective, and the sound is closer to pop than to rock. The following year, they released Essencials & Rareses where they returned to their rock roots.
Salva Racero left the group in 2016, to focus on a solo career. In 2019 the album Polièdric was released, which featured a variety of singers – including ex-member Pemi Fortuny Soler.
