Minors Aloud (subtitled Buddy Emmons with Lenny Breau) is an album by American pedal steel guitarist Buddy Emmons and Canadian guitarist Lenny Breau that was released in 1978.


== History ==
Minors Aloud was digitally remastered and reissued on CD by Art of Life in 2005 and includes a 6-page booklet, original and new liner notes and a copy of the lead sheet for the title track handwritten by Breau himself.
In his liner notes for the reissue, Emmons states: "... producer Mike Melford asked me if I would be interested in recording with Lenny Breau. My response was a quick yes but on the condition that Lenny would be the featured artist and I'd be listed as a guest... I learned later that Lenny hadn't been told anything about the project other than to just show up. With a few days preparation and a little polish to the arrangements, this would have been a different album. For better or worse we'll never know, but I do know the solos were spontaneous, the energy level was fantastic, and we all had a great time getting there."


== Reception ==

Writing for Allmusic, music critic Paul Kohler singled out a few of the songs as noteworthy and notes "The pedal steel definitely gives a rather unique sound to Benny Golson's "Killer Joe," though Breau is clearly the more interesting soloist... Flying Fish was always interested in mixing musicians from country and jazz; this somewhat uneven date should be considered at least a partial success."
