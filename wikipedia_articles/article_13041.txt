The Massey family is a Canadian family with Methodist roots that has been prominent since the mid-19th century, known for manufacturing farm equipment and for being patrons of the arts in Canada. The family's manufacturing company, later known as Massey Ferguson, provided the Masseys with their significant fortune. Subsequent generations of Masseys have risen to prominence in the arts, philanthropy and governance. The Massey name remains visible through institutions such as Massey Hall, Massey College and the Massey Lectures.


== History ==

The Masseys had been in North America since the 17th century, when Jeffrey Massey (1591–1676) migrated from England to the Massachusetts colony in the 1630s to work as a surveyor. The Masseys continued to live in Massachusetts for several generations and fought in the American Revolutionary War. During the first decade of the 19th century, Daniel Massey (1766–1832) and his wife, Rebecca Kelley (1765–1838), moved their family to Haldimand Township in Upper Canada to farm.

In 1847, their son Daniel Massey, Jr. (1798–1856) established the Newcastle Foundry and Machine Manufactory in what is now Newcastle, Ontario. The enterprise was subsequently renamed as the Massey Manufacturing Co. and, in 1879, moved to Toronto, Ontario.
In 1891, the Massey Manufacturing Co. merged with A. Harris, Son and Company to form Massey-Harris, which became the largest agricultural equipment maker in the British Empire. The company eventually became Massey-Harris-Ferguson as a result of a 1953 merger with the Ferguson Company, a British agricultural machinery firm. The company's name was shortened to Massey Ferguson in 1958. After running into financial difficulties during the 1980s, the company closed its Toronto operations in the 1990s. By 2000, the company became part of the American conglomerate AGCO, which continues the Massey Ferguson brand of farm equipment today.

In 1894, Hart Massey built Massey Hall, a performing arts theatre in Toronto, in memory of his late son, Charles Albert Massey (1848–1884), who loved music.
On 8 February 1915, Charles' son, Charles Albert "Bert" Massey II (1880–1915), was shot to death by Carrie Davies (c. 1897–1961), his 18-year-old British maid, sparking a trial of the century in Canada. Davies, who was ultimately found not guilty, claimed that she shot Bert because she was afraid that he wanted to sexually assault her.
In 1918, the family incorporated the Massey Foundation, which was responsible for the construction of various Toronto landmarks and was the first trust of its kind in Canada. In 1919, Vincent Massey, an alumnus and benefactor of the University of Toronto, initiated and financed at the university one of the earliest student centres in North America, naming it Hart House after his grandfather.
In 1952, Vincent would be sworn in as Governor General of Canada.
In 1962, the Massey Foundation established, built, and partially endowed Massey College, a graduate residential college at the University of Toronto.
In 1975, Massey Hall was municipally designated as a historic site under the Ontario Heritage Act. On 15 June 1981, Massey Hall was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Starting in July 2018, Massey Hall underwent a two-year restoration project to restore and renew both the interior and exterior of the building, improve patron amenities and accessibility, open two new music venues, and enable the return of the building's original stained glass windows from 1894.
In 1978, the family was the subject of a two-part CBC TV documentary, The Masseys: Chronicles of a Canadian Family, produced by Vincent Tovell, a grandson of Walter Massey, with music by Louis Applebaum.
