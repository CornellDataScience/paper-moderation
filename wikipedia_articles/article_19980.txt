== History ==
In 19th century Vinehall Street, the Vinehall School estate (TQ751205), was Rushton Park, in 1860 the home of William Rushton Adamson (1825 - 1898), JP, DL and lord of the manor, who was buried at All Saints Church in Mountfield. Rushton Park was described as a "handsome and well arranged mansion, situated on an eminence in extensive grounds, commanding beautiful views of the surrounding country: the pleasure grounds cover about 5 acres: the forcing garden consists of two ranges of houses [greenhouses], each 160 feet long: the house and stables are supplied with gas made on the premises." William Rushton Adamson was chairman of the Berne Land Company, and for The Thames and Mersey Marine Insurance Company, The North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company, and the London and St Katherine Docks Company was a director. By 1902 the estate was owned by Lord Ashton of Hyde (1855â€“1933), JP and parish principal landowner. It was then named as Vinehall, the buildings extending over 18 acres (7.3 ha) in a "well wooded" estate of 400 acres (160 ha). The grounds were "believed" to have been designed by Joseph Paxton. The school was established in 1938.

Nineteenth century maps of Vinehall Street show the Bell Inn public house, a brewery, post office, a National School for boys and girls, two farms, a fish pond and a club. At the north in woodland were a gas works, and a brick & tile works, with kiln.
