== History ==


=== 2013 tornado ===

On May 20, 2013, parts of Moore and neighboring Newcastle and southern Oklahoma City, were affected by an intense multiple-vortex EF5 tornado. The tornado struck Briarwood Elementary School (South Oklahoma City), Plaza Towers Elementary School (Moore), and Highland East Junior High School. Briarwood and Plaza Towers sustained enough damage to be considered a total loss. Highland East's gym was for the most part destroyed. All out buildings were destroyed completely. Seven third graders inside Plaza Towers' 2nd-3rd grade annex lost their lives when the structure's walls collapsed.


=== Ebola reaction ===
On October 20, 2014, the district asked several employees and students who had been on a Carnival Cruise ship which had also been carrying a lab technician who may have come in contact with specimens from Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan three weeks earlier, not to return to school until the worker was cleared and there was no medical threat.  The Lab technician tested negative and the employees and students were allowed to return to school.


=== 2015 tornado ===
On March 25, 2015, an EF2 tornado hit southern Oklahoma City and Moore and lifted the roof and damaged Southgate Elementary and other houses in the path of the tornado. Some were injured. No one was found dead.

=== Elementary schools ===


==== Briarwood Elementary School ====
The previous facility was built in 1984 by an Oklahoma City company, RGDC. It had a central building as well as separate buildings for classrooms, storage, and multipurpose functions. RGDC later experienced scandal in 1996 after issues in the construction of the Oklahoma County Jail were exposed. A team from the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Structural Engineering Institute (ASCE-SEI) examined the debris after the 2013 tornado. A civil engineer who serves as an associate professor and as the director of the Donald G. Fears Structural Engineering Lab at the University of Oklahoma, Chris Ramseyer, was one of the authors of the ASCE-SEI report. Ramseyer stated that the school had code violations and issues with its construction. Issues cited included rebar that was too short and insufficient steel in masonry walls. The current building, with a cost of $12 million, opened in 2014. It has designated safe rooms so children can avoid injury during a tornado. Funded by insurance coverage, it was built with a similar size as the previous building.
