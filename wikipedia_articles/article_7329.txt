Disco Deewane (Urdu: ڈسکو دیوانے) is a 1981 Pakistani pop  album released by the Pakistani singing duo, Nazia and Zoheb, comprising Nazia Hassan and  Zoheb Hassan, sister and brother respectively. The music was composed by Indian-British music director Biddu,  and Zoheb Hassan, who also produced it under the label of HMV India/Saregama. 
The album charted in fourteen countries worldwide and became the best-selling Asian pop record to date. The debut album led Nazia Hasan to overnight fame. It changed trends in music across South Asia, where it broke sales records. In India, it sold 100,000 records within a day of its release in Mumbai alone, went Platinum within three weeks, and went Double-Platinum soon after.
In South Asia, where the music industry was previously dominated by filmi Bollywood soundtracks, Disco Deewaane was the first non-soundtrack album to become a major success across the region, paving the way for the emergence of independent Pakistani and Indian pop music scenes. It was also the first South Asian pop album to top the charts in Brazil, while also becoming a hit in Russia, South Africa, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Latin America, and a success among the South Asian diaspora in regions such as Canada, the United Kingdom, United States, and West Indies.
This song also appeared on the soundtrack of the series Ms. Marvel, in the episode "Seeing Red", and was remixed in the Bollywood movie Student of the Year as "The Disco Song".

In 1997, the title song "Disco Deewane" was reused in the Tamil song "Paara Ushar" sung by K.S. Chithra.


=== The Disco Song ===
In 2012, a revamped cover version of the title song "Disco Deewane" was incorporated into the Indian Bollywood film Student of the Year. Called "The Disco Song", it incorporates Nazia Hassan's vocals, along with the vocals of Sunidhi Chauhan and Benny Dayal, while the music video features Bollywood actors, such as Alia Bhatt, Sidharth Malhotra, Varun Dhawan and Kajol.
Director Karan Johar used the song in his 2012 film after licensing the song from Sa Re Ga Ma. It has been contested by Nazia Hassan's family, as they claim that HMV doesn't own the album because it was financed by them in London.
