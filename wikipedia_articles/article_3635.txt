== Plot ==
Dr. Sushma Malhotra (Madhuri Dixit) treats her patient, a kind thief and killer (Aditya Pancholi), who has lost his memory in an accident. She renames him Krishna. For the care she takes, Krishna falls in love with her, and then they get married. Soon after they are married, however, Inspector Ranjeet Kapoor (Suresh Oberoi) warns her that her husband was set to kill her before his accident and may again attempt to kill her, but she disregards this. In another accident, while taking photographs of Sushma, Krishna falls and hurts his head. This injury brings back his old memories about his beloved sister's suicide in her failed marriage because Sushma attached a false photo of them and wrote a false letter saying she was pregnant with his child, which resulted in him trying to kill her. He says his name is Rajeev and claims Sushma killed his sister, but Inspector Ranjeet arrives in time to stop him and tell him a criminal named Monty actually killed his sister. Together, Inspector Ranjeet and Rajeev find Monty and his gang, and Monty confesses to killing Rajeev's sister because he wanted to blackmail him. Rajeev kills him while Inspector Ranjeet kills his gang. An injured Rajeev regrets harming his wife, and they are united, saying that he is not Rajeev; he is her "Krishna."
