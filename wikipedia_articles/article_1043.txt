== Critical reception ==

Love Is Magic was met with "generally favorable" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 78, based on 18 reviews. Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 77 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 22 reviews.
Michael Cyrs from The 405 said the album is Grant's "most consistent and enjoyable work yet." and it "still showcases his trademark unpredictability. Soft love songs still turn sexual. Robotic voices are paired with Grant’s prettiest singing." Anna Byrne from The Line of Best Fit said the album is Grant's "fourth solo record released exactly three years after the last, and you experience his customary level of brutal honesty, irresistible vulnerability and wit – but with the electronics dialled way up. The specificity of the lyrics and the boldness of the electronic orchestration should theoretically preclude this – but Grant lets the emotions that drive them show through enough that you can’t help but connect."
