Tomoka Nishiyama (西山 朋佳, Nishiyama Tomoka, born June 27, 1995) is a Japanese women's professional shogi player ranked 5-dan. She is the current holder of the Jo-Ō, Women's Ōshō and Hakurei titles as well as a former holder of the Women's Ōza and Women's Meijin titles.


== Early life, amateur shogi and education ==
Nishiyama was born on June 27, 1995, in Ōsakasayama, Osaka. She first was exposed to shogi as a three-year-old by watching her father and older sister play but really learned how to play the game as a five-year-old first-grade elementary school student. She soon started attending a neighborhood shogi school three times a week and playing practice games on the Internet.  In 2009, she won the girls' division of the 30th All Japan Junior High School Student Shogi Championship as a junior high school second-grade student and thereafter was accepted into the Japan Shogi Association's training group in Osaka. Nishiyama quickly progressed through the training group system and was eventually accepted into the JSA's  apprentice school at the rank of  6-kyū under the tutelage of shogi professional Hirofumi Itō.
After high school, Nishiyama moved to Tokyo to study environmental informatics at Keio University, but she has been on a leave of absence to focus on shogi since 2015.


== Apprentice shogi professional ==
Nishiyama was promoted to the rank of apprentice professional 1-dan in January 2014, becoming just the second woman to achieve that rank after Kana Satomi. Later that same year in September 2014, she became the second woman to be promoted to the rank of apprentice professional 2-dan (once again after Satomi). Nishiyama was 19 years and 2 months old when she was promoted, thus breaking Satomi's record of 21 years and 4 months. In December 2015, Nishiyama was promoted to the rank of apprentice professional 3-dan, thus becoming the second woman (yet again following Satomi) to achieve such a rank. At age 20 years and 5 months, she also broke Satomi's record of 21 years and 9 months. With Satomi having to leave the 3-dan league in 2018, Nishiyama is now the only woman competing in the league as of August 2019.
Nishiyama finished the 66th 3-dan League (October 2019 – March 2020) in third place with a record of 14 wins and 4 losses. Going into the last day of league play, Nishiyama was in provisional third place with a record of 12 wins and 4 losses, trailing Hiroki Taniai (13 wins and 3 losses) and Shinichirō Hattori (12 wins and 4 losses). Since Nishiyama's league seed was the lowest of the three, she needed to win both of her games and finish at least one game ahead of one of the other two to obtain automatic promotion to the rank of professional 4-dan. Taniai lost one of his two games, but Hatori and Nishiyama won both of theirs which meant that all three finished league play with the same record. Although Nishiyama missed out on being promoted due to her lower seed, her result was good enough to earn her a promotion point for future league play and means she needs only one more promotion point to qualify for full-professional status.
On April 1, 2021, the JSA announced that it had accepted Nishiyama's request to leave the apprenticeship school and become a women's professional under its affiliation. Nishiyama posted a message to her fans and supporters on her personal Twitter earlier that same day which thanked them for their support and explained that she decided to make the switch after giving the matter long consideration. The end of her career as an apprentice professional means she now only be able to become a regular shogi professional via the Professional Admissions Test available to qualifying amateurs and women professionals. On the other hand, it also means that she could now complete in all tournaments and title matches open to women's professional, and not only those in which apprentice professionals were allowed to participate.

On August 9, 2024, the JSA announced that it had approved Nishiyama's application for the Professional Admission Test, making her the second woman to be approved for the test. She satisfied the criteria for the test the previous month when she defeated a regular professional in the official tournament play to improve her recent record against regular professionals to 13 wins and 7 losses for a winning percentage of 65%. Nishiyama's test consists of a best-of-five test match against the five most recently promoted regular professionals (Yūjirō Takahashi, Taiki Yamakawa, Hirotoshi Ueno, Kenta Miyajima and Kanta Masegi) with her needing to win three of the five games to be awarded regular professional status as a "Free Class" professional. The schedule is for one game to be played a month starting in September 2024 under official game conditions.
Nishiyama's first game of her test against Yūjirō Takahashi was held on September 10; she defeated Takahashi in 132 moves to move one step closer to becoming the first woman to be awarded regular professional status by the Japan Shogi Association. Game 2 of the test against Taiki Yamakawa was played on October 2, 2024, with Yamakawa winning in 104 moves. Five days before the game on September 27, 2024, the JSA posted on its official website that Nishiyama had been diagnosed with COVID-19, and that Game 4 of her 4th Hakurei Title Match scheduled to be held the following day (September 28, 2024) against challenger Fukuma was being postponed as a result. After her Game 2 loss to Yamakawa, Nishiyama stated she was "sorry for any inconvenience she caused due to her inability to take better care of health" and that she "would try to  show her true playing strength in Game 3". Nishiyama faced Hirotoshi Ueno in Game 3 on November 8, 2024, but lost the game in 109 moves, which left her needing to win her next two games to pass the test.
