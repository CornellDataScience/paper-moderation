Cloud or Cloude is a surname found in early England and in some Native American families.


== Origins ==
It is not known when a name was first used as a family name and passed from a parent to the children (often from father to son), but instances of the practice are found in Europe approximately 1000 A.D. The family name or surname was often a modification of the father's name, or the name of a landmark or geographical location, an occupation or defining event, the name of a physical object or phenomenon of nature, etc.
The earliest known use of the Cloude/Cloud surname is in medieval England, where it is also recorded as de la Cloude, Clowd and Clowde. The surname may have come from a place name or a geographical feature.
The name is found in Native American families, Chief Red Cloud being an example, but the name was not passed on to his children. (Early Native Americans (indigenous peoples of America) did not use the naming convention of the Europeans, choosing instead to name their children after places, animals, events, religious symbols, etc.)
