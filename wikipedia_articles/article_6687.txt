Gages Lake is a census-designated place (CDP) in Warren Township, Lake County, Illinois, United States. The population was 10,637 at the 2020 census.


== History ==
The body of water known as Gages Lake was estimated to have formed nearly 10,000 years ago during the most recent ice age. 
In 1838 a schoolhouse was built in the area that would in time become Warren Township High School in 1917. In the 1840s a man known as John Gage and his brother George Gage began sellings parcels of land surrounding the lake which he called the North Grange Resort. Sometime prior to the developments in the 1920s, Richard Warren Sears (no relation to the name of the township) had purchased and owned the lake/surrounding land.

The census-designated place has received fire and police service from the neighboring village of Grayslake since the 1960s.
As part of the Wildwood Park District, in the 1970s the Gages Lake Conservation Committee (GLCC) was formed which still exists to this day.
