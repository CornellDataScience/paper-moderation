He spent 1926 to 1934 with Leeds United, winning promotions out of the Second Division in 1927–28 and 1931–32, and then spent two years with Port Vale.

Potts joined Blyth Spartans at the age of sixteen and played for them whilst working as a coal-hewer at Ashington Colliery. He turned professional at Leeds United after being signed for a fee of £200 in February 1926. He played 12 First Division games at the end of the 1925–26 season. Now club captain, he made 45 appearances in the 1926–27 season, as Leeds were relegated into the Second Division. He kept goal on 39 occasions in 1927–28, as United won promotion in second place. He featured 41 times in 1928–29, but played only 18 games in the 1929–30 campaign. He played 41 games in the 1930–31 season, as Leeds were relegated back into the second tier. He then played 32 matches in the 1931–32 season, as United were again promoted in second place. He made 34 appearances in the 1932–33 campaign, though was absent throughout the 1933–34 season. In his eight years at Elland Road he made 247 league and 15 FA Cup appearances.
In May 1934, he dropped into the Second Division to sign with Port Vale. He kept a clean sheet in his debut match – a 2–0 win over Sheffield United at The Old Recreation Ground on 25 August. He was an ever-present for the 1934–35 season and only missed two matches of the 1935–36 season, for a total of 86 appearances (82 in the Football League and four FA Cup) for the "Valiants". Despite this feat he was released at the end of the 1935–36 season, and was replaced by his understudy Allan Todd.
