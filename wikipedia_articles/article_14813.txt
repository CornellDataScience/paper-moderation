The 1990 Masters Tournament was the 54th Masters Tournament, held April 5–8 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.
Nick Faldo won his second consecutive Masters and the third of his six major titles on the second sudden-death playoff hole over Raymond Floyd, the 1976 champion. The playoff began on the tenth hole where both made par. At the next hole, #11, Floyd put his 7-iron approach shot into the pond left of the green, while Faldo hit to within 18 feet (5.5 m) of the cup; he lagged his birdie putt to within a few inches and tapped in for the win. It foiled Floyd's attempt to win a major in four different decades. Afterward, he said, "This is the most devastating thing that's ever happened to me in my career. I've had a lot of losses, but nothing like this."
Floyd led after each of the second and third rounds and had earned the reputation of being a good front-runner in his career. A birdie on 12 gave Floyd a four-shot lead with six holes to play. Faldo birdied 13, 15, and 16, and Floyd's bogey on 17 left them tied at 10-under par at the end of 72 holes.
It was the third consecutive year that the Masters champion was from the United Kingdom, which had no winners prior to Sandy Lyle's victory in 1988.
Faldo was the second to win consecutive titles at Augusta, following Jack Nicklaus (1965 and 1966). Faldo's wins came at the second hole of a sudden-death playoff, at the eleventh green. Tiger Woods later won back-to-back Masters in 2001 and 2002. Faldo won his third Masters six years later in 1996, for his sixth and final major title.
Chris Patton was the only amateur to make the cut and tied for 39th place at 296 (+8).
