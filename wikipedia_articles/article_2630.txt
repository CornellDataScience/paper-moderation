== Biography ==
Epstein was born in Kovno, Lithuania on 7 May 1893. His father was David Epstein, a bootmaker and his mother was Malka Epstein. Both parents were Orthodox Jews. The family moved to Paris when he was very young, and in 1903, they moved to London. There, he attended Old Castle Street School, and Raine's Foundation School.
At the age of fifteen, he studied Talmud at Great Garden Street's beit midrash. Due to the quality of his work, he was sent to study at the Pressburg Yeshiva under Rabbi Akiva Sofer. 
(He had also studied in Paris under Rabbi Zadoc Kahn, Chief Rabbi of France.)
He received semikhah (ordination) from Rabbi Isaiah Silberstein of Vác, and subsequently from Rabbi Yisrael Chaim Daiches of Leeds, and from Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, while the latter was based in London during World War I.
He was advised by Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz to obtain an academic education.
He studied at the University of London, earning a First Class BA Honours degree in Semitic languages, followed by two doctorates, the PhD and the DLit.
He served as rabbi of Middlesbrough Hebrew Congregation  (1920-1928), following which he joined the teaching staff of Jews' College, London. In 1945 he was appointed Director of Studies and subsequently Principal. 

He retired in 1961.
Epstein married twice: he married his first wife Jeanie in Belfast in 1921 and the couple had two children, Rachel and Leon. However, she died in 1924, and Epstein remarried 3 June 1925. With his second wife, Gertrude, Isidore had a third child on 13 April 1926: Samuel Stanley Epstein, who died on 13 March 2018. Rabbi Epstein died on 13 April 1962.
