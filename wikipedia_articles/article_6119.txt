The 2017 World Junior Figure Skating Championships were held March 15–19, 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan. Commonly called "World Juniors" and "Junior Worlds", the event determined the World Junior champions in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing.
Pair champions Ekaterina Alexandrovskaya / Harley Windsor became the first skaters representing Australia to win gold at an ISU Figure Skating Championships. The United States received gold in two disciplines, with Vincent Zhou winning the men's singles title and Rachel Parsons / Michael Parsons taking the ice dancing title. Russia's Alina Zagitova won the ladies' title in her first appearance at the event.


== Records ==

The following new junior records were set during this competition:


== Qualification ==
Skaters from all ISU member nations were eligible for the competition if they were at least 13 years old but not 19—or 21 for male pair skaters and ice dancers—before 1 July 2016 in their place of birth. National associations select their entries according to their own criteria but the ISU mandates that their selections achieve a minimum technical elements score (TES) at an international event prior to the World Junior Championships.
The term "Junior" in ISU competition refers to age, not skill level. Skaters may remain age-eligible for Junior Worlds even after competing nationally and internationally at the senior level. At junior events, the ISU requires that all programs conform to junior-specific rules regarding program length, jumping passes, types of elements, etc.
