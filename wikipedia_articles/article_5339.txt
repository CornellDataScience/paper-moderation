FC Shakhtyor Soligorsk (Belarusian: ФК Шахцёр Салігорск, romanized: FK Shakhtsyor Salihorsk, Russian: ФК Шахтёр Солигорск) is a Belarusian Premier League football club, playing in the city of Salihorsk (Soligorsk).


== History ==
The club was founded in 1961. During Soviet era, Shakhtyor Soligorsk played in the top or second division of the Belarusian SSR league, occasionally dropping to lower tiers (Minsk Oblast league) for a short time. In 1971, Shakhtyor absorbed two other local Soligorsk teams (Khimik and Gornyak). Their best results came toward the end of Soviet days, when the team finished as league runners-up twice (1988, 1990) and won the Belarusian SSR Cup three times (1985, 1986, 1988).
Since 1992, Shakhtyor has been playing in Belarusian Premier League. The team struggled through the 1990s, usually fighting against relegation. In 1997, they finished at the last place in the league, but were saved from relegation after two other Premier League clubs withdrew.
After a transitory 1998 season, since 1999, they have never finished below 6th place and became a staple European Cups participant. Shakhtyor Soligorsk became the champions of Belarus in 2005, 2020 and 2021, and were league runners-up six times (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2018). They also won the Belarusian Cup three times (2004, 2014, and 2019).
On May 11, 2023, following a match-fixing scandal, the club was stripped of the 2022 league title and received a 30-point deduction for the following campaign, as well as an additional 20-point deduction the campaign afterwards.
