In number theory, an Euler product is an expansion of a Dirichlet series into an infinite product indexed by prime numbers. The original such product was given for the sum of all positive integers raised to a certain power as proven by Leonhard Euler. This series and its continuation to the entire complex plane would later become known as the Riemann zeta function.


== Definition ==
In general, if a is a bounded multiplicative function, then the Dirichlet series

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
          
        
        
          
            
              a
              (
              n
              )
            
            
              n
              
                s

In fact, if we consider these as formal generating functions, the existence of such a formal Euler product expansion is a necessary and sufficient condition that a(n) be multiplicative: this says exactly that a(n) is the product of the a(pk) whenever n factors as the product of the powers pk of distinct primes p.
An important special case is that in which a(n) is totally multiplicative, so that P(p, s) is a geometric series. Then

  
    
      
        P
        (
        p
        ,
        s
        )
        =
        
          
            1
            
              1
              −
              
                
                  
                    a
                    (
                    p
                    )
                  
                  
                    p
                    
                      s
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(p,s)={\frac {1}{1-{\frac {a(p)}{p^{s}}}}},}
  

as is the case for the Riemann zeta function, where a(n) = 1, and more generally for Dirichlet characters.


== Convergence ==
In practice all the important cases are such that the infinite series and infinite product expansions are absolutely convergent in some region

  
    
      
        Re
        ⁡
        (
        s
        )
        >
        C
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (s)>C,}
  

that is, in some right half-plane in the complex numbers. This already gives some information, since the infinite product, to converge, must give a non-zero value; hence the function given by the infinite series is not zero in such a half-plane.
In the theory of modular forms it is typical to have Euler products with quadratic polynomials in the denominator here. The general Langlands philosophy includes a comparable explanation of the connection of polynomials of degree m, and the representation theory for GLm.


== Examples ==
The following examples will use the notation 
  
    
      
        
          P
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} }
  
 for the set of all primes, that is:

  
    
      
        
          P
        
        =
        {
        p
        ∈
        
          N
        
        
        
          |
        
        
        p
        
           is prime
        
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} =\{p\in \mathbb {N} \,|\,p{\text{ is prime}}\}.}
  

The Euler product attached to the Riemann zeta function ζ(s), also using the sum of the geometric series, is

Since for even values of s the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) has an analytic expression in terms of a rational multiple of πs, then for even exponents, this infinite product evaluates to a rational number. For example, since ζ(2) = ⁠π2/6⁠, ζ(4) = ⁠π4/90⁠, and ζ(8) = ⁠π8/9450⁠, then
