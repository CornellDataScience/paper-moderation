Donald Fisher is a fictional character in the Australian television soap opera Home and Away played by actor Norman Coburn as a regular character, from the soap's inception in 1988 to 2003. The role initially had the name Raymond Phillips however producers changed the name prior to final filming. He acts as the main antagonist in the show's pilot episode, willing to go to any lengths to ensure local teen Bobby Simpson is locked up, however his character soon softens. He spends almost his entire tenure on the show as the Principal of Summer Bay (at which he is given his iconic nickname "Flathead"), where he is stern but fair to all the students. Although departing as a main character in 2003, Coburn has since returned for brief appearances in 2004, 2005 and 2007. Coburn's long-running portrayal of Fisher earned him a place in the 2002 Guinness World Records alongside castmates Ray Meagher and Kate Ritchie as the longest serving cast member of an Australian soap opera.


== Casting ==
When actor Norman Coburn received the role of "money-grabbing politician" Donald Fisher, he thought it would be for a short stint. He stayed with the show as it provided him with financial security for his family. While filming the pilot in 1987, the producers decided they needed to change the character's mean persona and job, as they thought he would be "more useful" as the headmaster of Summer Bay High. Coburn explained, "They came to me halfway through and said, 'We don't want him to be a villain any more â€“ can you soften him up and make him a bit nicer?' I responded, 'It's a bit late now!'"
Coburn chose to leave the serial in 2003, after 15 years in the role. He felt that he had done everything he wanted to do and it was time to move on. He told the producers of his decision with a year left on his contract. He joked, "they kind of brushed me aside in the hope I would forget about it". The writers gave the character a "sedate ending", which saw him move away with his new partner June Reynolds (Rowena Wallace), so that they could bring him back for guest appearances in the future. Coburn filmed a brief return in the same year and agreed to return in 2004.
In 2015, Home and Away producers planned to bring the character back into the series. Writers created a month long euthanasia story in which Donald would have been suffering with dementia. In addition he would seek the help of his friend Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) to die. In 2022, the show's former script executive Dan Bennett revealed that Donald's return had been written but was blocked by Seven Network. Bennett claimed that network executives believed "no one would care" about the story and forced its cancellation. Other parts of the story continued on-screen without Donald's presence.

== Reception ==
The episode featuring the earthquake where Donald and several other students were at risk in the school was nominated for an Australian Film Institute Award. The episode featuring Donald facing backlash over allowing Marat/Sade to be performed at the school won writer Linda Stainton the Australian Writers Guild Award in 1998.
Channel 5 chose Donald's wedding to Marilyn, Donald's disappearance at sea, his departure and 2007 return among their best episodes.
During his review of the show's first episode for The Sydney Morning Herald, Robin Oliver called Fisher "the town nasty" and noted that the script made him "too vile to be readily acceptable", however, later scripts saw him softened.
Brian Courtis of The Age criticised Donald's exit in 2003: "Don certainly merited more than this teary-eyed, Goodbye-Mr-Chips dismissal. Old  "Flathead", never happy at the cheeriest of times, has reason to look sad and sorry in his farewell episode of Home And Away (7pm, Seven). It is sloppy, sentimental, touching... showing almost unspeakable verisimilitude to real life. There is a last dollop of poetry for his final class of kids, an endless minor-key tinkling of the piano as Fisher's groper-wide mouth gulps at the thought of leaving his beloved waters, and then, with students, staff and locals, the big, emotional, surprise farewell party before he tootles off to Queensland, Valhalla of all Australian soapie greats."
Virgin Media described Donald as having "a fearsome demeanor" and "always had the interests of his pupils at heart."
