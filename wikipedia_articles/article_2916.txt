The gens Satriena was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome.  No members of this gens obtained any of the higher offices of the Roman state, but a number are known from coins and inscriptions.


== Origin ==
The nomen Satrienus belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from other nomina using the suffix -enus.  The root of the name is Satrius, the nomen of a more prominent gens.


== Praenomina ==
The praenomina used by the Satrieni include Publius, Quintus, Gaius, and Lucius, four of the most common names throughout Roman history.


== Branches and cognomina ==
The Satrieni used a variety of common surnames, including Pollio, a polisher, belonging to a class of cognomina derived from occupations; Salvia and Secunda, old praenomina that came to be regarded as surnames; Juvenalis, youthful, and perhaps Celsa, originally given to one who was particularly tall.
