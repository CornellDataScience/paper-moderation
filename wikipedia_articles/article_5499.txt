Walker O. Cain (April 14, 1915 – June 1, 1993) was an American architect.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===
Cain was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Oscar C. Cain (1877-1954), a postal clerk for the railroad, and his wife Meta M. Gusse. He studied architecture for five years on a scholarship at Case Western Reserve University (B.Arch. 1938), and for two years at Princeton University (M.F.A. 1940). A brother, Howard B. Cain, also an architect, was for a time the president of the Cleveland chapter of the American Institute of Architects. A nephew, Bruce Cain, was an architect for many years with the US Naval Department.
During the summer of 1937, having won the Schweinfurth Traveling Scholarship (awarded annually by the school of architecture at Case Western), Cain traveled to France to study at the School of Fine Arts at Fontainbleau. At the conclusion of his course, he visited Italy, leaving Trieste aboard the SS Saturnia on September 20, arriving in the Port of New York on October 4.
In 1939, he received the Henry Adams Medal from the American Institute of Architects, awarded to the best student in each accredited architecture program, and in 1940, he won the competition for the Rome Prize of the American Academy in Rome (having won honorable mention in 1938 and 1939).


=== Architectural career ===
Having graduated from Princeton and unable to travel to Rome on account of the war in Europe, Cain moved to New York to join the firm of McKim, Mead & White. He was named an associate in 1951, and after the death in February 1961 of James Kellum Smith, the firm’s last surviving partner, several of the firm’s senior employees, including Cain, formed the firm Steinmann, Cain and White, in order to complete the older firm’s outstanding projects. Cornelius White (no relation to Stanford White) died in 1962, and in 1965, the firm reorganized as Steinmann and Cain, succeeded in 1967 by Walker O. Cain & Associates.


=== Honors ===
Walker Cain was made a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1968. He was elected chairman of the board of the American Academy in Rome in 1974 and served in that capacity until 1984. In 1962, he was elected an Associate National Academician, and in 1975, a full National Academician, by the membership of the National Academy of Design.


=== Personal life ===
In June 1941, Walker Cain married Abby Jane Huston (the marriage was dissolved by divorce). They had two children, Susan Berry Cain and Tamma Huston Cain.
On July 27, 1973, He married Elizabeth Douglas McCall (1919-1996). According to The New York Times:

The Rev. William A. McQuoid performed the ceremony in the Dana Chapel of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church. He was assisted by the Rev. Dr. John C. Coburn, rector of St. James' Episcopal Church. The bride, daughter of Mrs. Arthur May McCall of Florence, S. C., and the late Mr. McCall, was divorced from Arthur A. Houghton Jr., board chairman of Steuben Glass. The bridegroom, son of Mrs. Oscar C. Cain of Cleveland and the late Mr. Cain, also has been previously married and divorced. He is senior partner of Walker O. Cain Associates, an architectural firm here.

His second marriage brought Cain yet another honor. A reporter for the Times noted that the 1974 edition of the Social Register "contains few surprises," while observing that,

As usual, some names have been dropped and others added, as a rule through marriage to people already listed...Arthur A. Houghton Jr., board chairman of Steuben Glass, and his former wife, Mrs. Elizabeth McCall Houghton, both remarried in 1973 and their new spouses, the former Mrs. Nina Rodale Horstmann, and Walker O. Cain, a New York architect, were welcomed to the fold.

Walker Cain died in Southampton, New York in 1993. Elizabeth Cain died in New York City in 1996.
