The chief justice of Trinidad and Tobago is the highest judge of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and presides over its Supreme Court of Judicature. He is appointed by a common decision of the president, the prime minister and the leader of the main opposition party.


== History ==
Tobago was claimed for England already by King James I in 1608, however in the following time saw varying rulers. In 1794, a planter was elected the first chief justice. The island was eventually ceded to the United Kingdom in 1814 at the Treaty of Paris and from 1833 it was assigned to the colony of the British Windward Islands.
In 1797 Trinidad, who had been previously controlled by the Spanish Crown, was captured by a fleet commanded by Sir Ralph Abercromby and thus came under British government. The post of a chief justice was established in March of the same year. Both islands, Trinidad and Tobago were incorporated into a single colony in 1888, which gained its independence in 1962.
