Loveblows & Lovecries – A Confession is the debut album of British art rock band No-Man. It was released in the UK by One Little Indian Records label in May, 1993, and in a slightly different format in the US on 550 Music in May, 1994.
"Taking It Like a Man", a single taken from the US version of the album reached number 34 on the Billboard Dance Chart in April 1994 and was used on the US TV drama, Models, Inc.
Critically lauded at the time of its release, the album was considered by the likes of UK magazines Melody Maker and Lime Lizard as an intriguing combination of art rock ambition, synthpop textures, and infectious pop hooks.
