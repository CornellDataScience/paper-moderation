In 2001, he joined then-Serie B club Napoli, failing to win promotion to the top flight with the fallen giants. He then signed for Reggina in 2002, his final Serie A season as a player. He retired in 2009 after a season with Juve Stabia.

On 12 June 2015 Rastelli was hired by newly relegated club Cagliari for their 2015–16 Serie B season. He led Cagliari to win the Serie B title, and was consequently confirmed also for the 2016–17 Serie A campaign. He was sacked on 17 October 2017.

On 31 August 2021 he was named new head coach of Serie B club Pordenone. He was however dismissed himself on 16 October 2021, with Pordenone lying at the bottom of the league table, as he failed to turn the club's fortunes.
