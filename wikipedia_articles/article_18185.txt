=== The Relics of Time ===
(released 2 September 2010)

The Doctor returns to Nest Cottage in Sussex a year after defeating the alien Hornets.  But while doing some maintenance on the TARDIS, his housekeeper, Mrs Wibbsey takes four pieces of the ship's spatial geometer and trades them to a mysterious figure for four paper items that seem to have some relation to the Doctor.  Now they must travel throughout time to learn their significance and find the missing components.  The first item is a page from a history book discussing a Mosaic that depicts the Doctor's face.  So he and Wibbsey go back to Ancient Britain, c. 43 AD, shortly before Emperor Claudius' Roman invasion.  There they find two warring tribes, one of which is being aided by a wise wizard.
