Coacalco de Berriozábal (; simply known as Coacalco) is one of 125 municipalities in the State of Mexico, Mexico. The municipal seat is the city of San Francisco Coacalco.  The municipality lies in the Greater Mexico City conurbation, north of Mexico City. The municipal seat is San Francisco Coacalco and the municipality is named after Felipe Berriozábal (1829–1900), a Mexican politician and military leader.
The word Coacalco comes from the Nahuatl coatl (snake), calli (home) and -co (at), meaning "at the house of the snake", a name that was first recorded in 1320.

On 12 February 1862, General Felipe Berriozábal, then-governor of the state, signed an order that declared Coacalco an independent municipality, ending a 343-year-old dependency of Ecatepec.
