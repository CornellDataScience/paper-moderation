=== MacArthur Fellows Program ===
Olufunmilayo Olopade was one of the three African-Americans to receive the $500,000 award. This award was appointed by John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. This "no strings attached" stipend grant was given as support for up to five years and was referred to as the "genius grant." This grant allowed Olopade to continue her research on her groundbreaking discoveries on diseases and health concerns.


== Family ==
In 1983, she married Christopher Sola Olopade who is also a physician at the University of Chicago. They have two daughters, including journalist Dayo Olopade, and one son.


== Research ==
Most of her research was on the susceptibility to cancer which would then be used to adopt a more effective way of treating breast cancer among the African and African-American individuals and populations.
In 1987 at the University of Chicago, she found a gene that helped suppress tumor growth.
In 1992, Olopade helped found the University of Chicago's Center for Clinical Cancer Genetics. Here, she found that African-American women often developed breast cancer at younger ages than white women.
In 2003, she began a new study looking at breast cancer and genetics from African women from Nigeria to Senegal and also African-American women in Chicago. By 2005, she found that 80% of tumors in African women did not need estrogen to grow compared to 20% of tumors in Caucasian the women. She also found that this was due to a different pattern of gene expression between the African women and the Caucasian women.
