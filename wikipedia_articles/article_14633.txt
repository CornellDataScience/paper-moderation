Gainesville High School was founded in 1892. It originally served White students only. In 1969, when court orders forced integration, the all-Black E. E. Butler High School was closed and its students rezoned to GHS.

Like the majority of comprehensive high schools in the US, GHS offers Advanced Placement and honors courses. In addition to Advanced Placement courses, Gainesville High School offers the AP Capstone program which gives students a chance at a second diploma by taking college level classes such as AP Seminar and AP Research. It also offers vocational curricula. In 2003 the school incorporated a formal Apprenticeship and Mentor Program to tech prep classes.

== Athletics ==

GHS teams are known as the Red Elephants. They are the only school in the country with that mascot. They received the name in the 1920s when the well-known writer Grantland Rice decided to watch the final game of the undefeated 1925 Gainesville Red Elephants football team. Rice quipped "The team is coming on the field looking like a herd of "Red Elephants as the ground shakes beneath their feet". From 1923 to 1925 The Red Elephants had a combined record of 26 wins and 0 losses (19 of those 26 wins came via shutout). They scored a combined 1045 points and allowed only 70.  The GHSA did not exist at the time and State Champions were not named.
The Red Elephants football team won the State Championship in 2012 with Deshaun Watson (Current Cleveland Browns QB) leading the way.
