== History ==
The Smiths Indeed were formed in Liverpool in 2005. They played their first show in Glasgow at Bar Bia on 10 December 2005. They quickly gained a reputation for excellent live shows. They have played multiple extensive UK tours, playing prestigious venues such as Manchester Apollo, London Shepherd's Bush Empire and Glasgow Old Fruitmarket. They have also toured Europe and North America. In 2016, they played two shows at the Smiths Morrissey Convention at Avalon Hollywood in Los Angeles. The band strive to recreate the experience of seeing a mid-1980s Smiths concert. In order to get the atmosphere just right, they pay particular attention to using authentic instruments and equipment.
The Smiths Indeed name is taken from the run-out grooves etching on the vinyl of the 1984 Smiths single, "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now". A Smiths fanzine called Smiths Indeed also existed between 1986 and 1989.
The musicians were from various well-known Liverpool-based bands such as The Christians, Pete Wylie and Maudlin Rich.
In 2017, singer Jürgen Wendelen formed Morrissey Indeed as a continuation of The Smiths Indeed. Morrissey Indeed were based in Antwerp, Belgium and continued to tour in the UK and Europe. From 2019, they tour as The Smiths Presumably.
