Cape Runaway (Māori: Whangaparāoa) is the eastern extremity of the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand's North Island. It is located 157 kilometres northeast off Whakatāne and 65 kilometres west of East Cape.
The name Cape Runaway was bestowed by English mariner James Cook during his first voyage of discovery in 1769. It was so named after Māori in canoes who had approached Cooks' ship Endeavour in a hostile manner scurried off after a cannon shot was fired.
