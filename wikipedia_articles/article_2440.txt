The 1932 VFL season was the 36th season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured twelve clubs and ran from 30 April to 1 October, comprising an 18-match home-and-away season followed by a four-week finals series featuring the top four clubs.
Richmond won the premiership, defeating Carlton by nine points in the 1932 VFL grand final; it was Richmond's third VFL premiership. Carlton won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 15–3 win–loss record. Fitzroy's Haydn Bunton Sr. won his second consecutive Brownlow Medal as the league's best and fairest player, and Geelong's George Moloney won the leading goalkicker medal as the league's leading goalkicker.


== Background ==
In 1932, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances.
Teams played each other in a home-and-away season of 18 rounds; matches 12 to 18 were the "home-and-way reverse" of matches 1 to 7.
Once the 18 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1932 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the Page–McIntyre system.

== Season notes ==
Rain had delayed the resurfacing of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, so Melbourne arranged to play its first three matches for the year at the Motordrome. These were the only three VFL matches ever staged at the venue.
In round 11, due to the effects of an extremely strong cross-wind that blew all day at the Lake Oval, the up-to-that-time-unbeaten South Melbourne lost to Collingwood, kicking 5.17 (47) to their opponent's more accurate 7.8 (50).
After the match was over, it was revealed that Richmond wingman Alan Geddes had played the entire second half of the Grand-Final with a broken jaw.
