The Arizona state elections of 2006 were held on November 7, 2006. All election results are from the Arizona Secretary of State's office.
The deadline for signing petition signatures to appear on the primary ballot for all races was June 14, 2006.
This article does not yet include complete information about the state propositions placed on the ballot, but major propositions for Arizona in 2006 included:

An attempt to add language to the AZ Constitution that would declare a marriage as only between a man and a woman (did not pass; as of 2006, AZ is the only state to reject a same-sex marriage ban proposed to its voters, though an amendment to the state constitution passed in 2008)
Two competing statewide smoking bansâ€”one sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and one sponsored by various health organizations. (The health orgs' Prop 201 passed and will ban smoking in all indoor locations except some tobacco shops and some fraternal organizations)
Four propositions that affected illegal immigrants, including ones that would make English the official language of Arizona, and restrict some currently held rights of illegal immigrants.

When a vacancy occurs on the bench, a Judicial Nominating Committee approves the names of at least three applicants for nomination, from which the Governor appoints one to the position. After appointment, all Judges and Justices are subject to judicial election retentions, statewide for Justices and in their separate districts for Judges. Supreme Court Justices serve a six-year term; all other state Judges serve four-year terms. There is a mandatory retirement age of 65 for all judicial offices.
