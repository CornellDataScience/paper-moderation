The 2016 PDC Pro Tour was a series of non-televised darts tournaments organised by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). Players Championships, UK Open Qualifiers and European Tour events are the events that make up the Pro Tour. In 2016 there were 36 PDC Pro Tour events held – 20 Players Championships, six UK Open Qualifiers and ten European Tour events.


== Prize money ==
Prize money for each Players Championship increased from £60,000 to £75,000 per event. The UK Open Qualifiers and European Tour events stayed the same as in 2015.
This is how the prize money is divided:


== PDC Tour Cards ==
128 players are granted Tour Cards, which enables them to participate in all Players Championships, UK Open Qualifiers and European Tour events.


=== Tour Cards ===
The 2016 Tour Cards are awarded to:

(63) The top 64 players from the PDC Order of Merit after the 2016 World Championship.
Kevin McDine resigned his card.
(27) The 27 of 34 qualifiers from 2015 Q-School not ranked in the top 64 of the PDC Order of Merit following the World Championship.
Steve Douglas resigned his card.
(2) Two highest qualifiers from 2015 Challenge Tour (Jan Dekker and Richie Corner).
Jan Dekker is also in the top 64 of the PDC Order of Merit, and therefore, a Pro Tour Card was awarded to Shaun Griffiths, who finished third on the Challenge Tour Order of Merit.
(2) Two highest qualifiers from 2015 Development Tour (Mike De  Decker and Bradley Kirk).
Bradley Kirk turned down his Tour Card, which was subsequently awarded to Berry van Peer.
(2) Two highest qualifiers from 2014 Challenge Tour (Mark Frost and Alan Tabern).
(1) Two highest qualifiers from 2014 Development Tour (Dimitri Van den Bergh and Josh Payne).
Dimitri Van den Bergh is also in the top 64 of the PDC Order of Merit, and therefore, one extra Tour Card was awarded to a Q-School qualifier.
(1) The winner of the 2015 Scandinavian Order of Merit (Kim Viljanen).
(16) The 16 qualifiers from 2016 Q-School.
Afterwards, the playing field was complemented by the highest qualified players from the Q School Order of Merit until the maximum number of 128 Pro Tour Card players had been reached. In 2016, that meant a total of 14 players qualified this way.
