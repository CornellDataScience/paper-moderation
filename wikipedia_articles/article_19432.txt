In the 7-meter shootout, Wanne scored the decisive penalty against Danijel Šarić and sent his team to the Champions League final. Wanne did not take any part in the final match where Flensburg defeated their German rival THW Kiel 30–28 and reached the Champions League trophy for the first time in the club's history. At the end of the season, Wanne extended his contract with Flensburg until the end of 2015/16 season.
In 2015, Wanne became DHB-Pokal champion with his team after he scored once again the winning penalty in the 7-meter shootout against SC Magdeburg.
In summer 2022, Wanne left SG Flensburg-Handewitt for FC Barcelona.
