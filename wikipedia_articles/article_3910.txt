The dialect belongs to the Masovian dialect group and is located in the part of Poland. It borders the Near Mazovian dialect to the north, the Lesser Polish Masovian Borderland dialect to the east, and the Łęczyca dialect to the south and west.
The classification of Łowicz is much debated. Traditionally it has been considered a Lesser Polish dialect, but there are many traits placing it within the Masovian group. Ties with Pogranicze Mazowsza have also been made. Łowicz shows many transitional features between Masovia, Greater Poland, and Lesser Poland. Many traits are also unevenly distributed across the region.


== Phonology ==
Typical of Greater Polish as well as Lesser Polish dialects, voicing of word-final consonants before vowels and liquids is present here, including before clitics. Some villages show devoicing under influence from Standard Polish. Typical of Masovian and Lesser Polish dialects is the presence of mazuration, however, this process is being undone for many speakers, but formed with mazuration are still dominant.


=== Vowels ===
As in Lesser Polish dialects, i, y often lower before l, ł: urobieły (urobiły), liceła (liczyła). Similarly, iR, yR can lower to eR. Ablaut is often levelled: gnietły (gniotły), wietraki (wiatraki). Final -ej often shifts to -i / -y, particularly in the comparative of adverbs, the feminine genitive/locative ending -ej, and the adverb dzisiaj: downi (dawniej), wincy (więcej), ty włody (wej wody), dzisiej (dzisiaj). A few instances of initial ja-, ra- > je-, re- can be found, as in Masovian dialects: jek (jak), redzić (radzić). Mobile e is often inserted: meter (metr).


==== Slanted vowels ====
Historic slanted vowels are often realized the same as in Standard Polish due to influence from it, but may be realized differently. Slanted á may raise to o or be realized as a, or is sporadically and rarely retained as á. Slanted ó is generally retained as ó (between o and u). Slanted é has lowered and merged with e, where most neighboring dialects raise é to y/i, but inconsistent raising to y (after hard consonants)/i (after soft consonants) may sometimes be heard. Jasne e can be seen in adjectival declension replacing historic é, which is typical of Lesser Polish dialects, but reflexes é can also be seen, as in Masovian and more particularly Greater Polish.


==== Nasal vowels ====
Medially nasal vowels usually raise and decompose before non-sibilants: lyngły (lęgły), winkse (większe), przyglundała (przyglądała) or only raise to į (after soft consonants)/y̨ (after hard consonants) and ų before sibilants. Nasal vowels before l ł may give n: wzino (wzięło), zaceny (zaczęły). Final -ą usually decomposes to -om and sometimes raises to -um: oglądajom (oglądają), najedzum (najedzą). Final -ę usually denasalizes to -e and sometimes raises to -y: na marmolady (na marmoladę), takom jaglanom kase (taką jaglaną kasę). Generally the groups eN and oN often raise, but sometimes oN doesn't: chłopokim (chłopakiem), latym (latem), struny (strony), dónica, donica (donica). oN is most commonly not raised, which is the result of influence of Standard Polish. aN also often raises: nie móm (nie mam). Similarly, iN may sometimes lower to eN, as in Lesser Polish dialects: jendyk (indyk), and uN can lower to óN, oN.


==== Prothesis ====
Initial o- typically labializes, as does rarely initial u-. Medial -o- may also sporadically labialize, as in Lesser Polish dialects. Initial u- may also gain prothetic j-, as in Greater Polish dialects: juzda (uzda). Initial a-, i- and sometimes medial -a-, -i- may gain a prothetic j-: jiść (iść), strojeły (stroiły).
