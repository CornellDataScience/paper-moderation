Sigma Delta Tau (ΣΔΤ) is an American sorority and member of the National Panhellenic Conference. Sigma Delta Tau was founded on March 25, 1917 at  Cornell University by Jewish women. However, there is no religious requirement for membership to the sorority, and it prides itself on being inclusive of all, as well as being historically Jewish. Sigma Delta Tau has over 70,000 initiates from 105 chapters  around the United States. 


== History ==
Sigma Delta Tau was founded on March 25, 1917 at Cornell University by seven Jewish women: Dora Bloom Turteltaub, Amy Apfel Tishman, Marian Gerber Greenberg, Grace Srenco Grossman, Inez Dane Ross, Regene Freund Cohane and Lenore Rubinow. The original name, Sigma Delta Phi, was changed after the women discovered a sorority with the same name already existed.


=== Symbols ===
The sorority's official flower is the golden tea rose and its jewel is lapis lazuli. The colors of Sigma Delta Tau are cafe au lait and old blue. The sorority's symbol is the torch, which is also the name of its national publication.
The current badge is a jeweled gold torch. On the front of the torch are the Greek letters ΣΔΤ, with six pearls and a diamond. The badge is worn as an emblem of membership by initiated members. Uninitiated members wear a different badge, a gold torch enameled in old blue.


== Philanthropy ==
The current national philanthropies of Sigma Delta Tau are Prevent Child Abuse America, the Sigma Delta Tau Foundation, and Jewish Women International.
Prevent Child Abuse America was selected as Sigma Delta Tau's National Philanthropy in 1982. Each Sigma Delta Tau chapter conducts an annual service project, educational program or major fund raiser for the benefit of Prevent Child Abuse America. Since 1982, Sigma Delta Tau has donated more than $3 million to PCAA.
The Sigma Delta Tau Foundation was chosen as an official philanthropic partner in 2017.
