== History ==
The Dyersburg Forked Deers began competition in 1923 as members of the Class D Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League. Their scheduled season opener on May 15 was rained out. They won the next day's game against the Fulton Railroaders, 3–2 in 10 innings, at Scot's Field before a home audience of around 1,200 people. On August 24, June Greene pitched a 10–0 no-hitter against Fulton in the second game of a doubleheader. The Forked Dears won the first half of the league's split season, qualifying for the championship playoffs. They then defeated the Mayfield Pantmakers to win the KITTY League championship, four games to two. Their season record was 51–47 (.520).
The Forked Deers repeated as first half champions in 1924. They won a second KITTY League championship by sweeping the Paris Parisians in four games in the best-of-seven championship series. They accumulated a 60–48 (.556) record during the season.
The KITTY League failed to reorganize for the 1925 season, so Dyersburg joined the Class D Tri-State League. They also shortened their name to simply the Dyersburg Deers. On August 17, William Cason no-hit the Blytheville Tigers in a 4–0 home win. The Deers compiled a season record of 59–46 (.562) but failed to win either half of the season.
Dyersburg did not field another team in 1926. Over three years of competition the team accumulated a record of 170–141 (.547).
