"That's How Strong My Love Is" is a song written by Roosevelt Jamison and first recorded in 1964 by deep soul singer O. V. Wright.
The song is a soulful love ballad and has been covered many times, most notably in 1965 by Otis Redding, with Redding's cover reaching no.18 on the Billboard R&B chart and no.74 on the US pop chart.  Redding's version is regarded as one of his signature songs.   The lyrics use natural phenomena such as the sun, the moon, and the ocean to describe the extent of the author's love.
