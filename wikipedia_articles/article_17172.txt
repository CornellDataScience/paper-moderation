Before becoming Tattoo Colour, four band members: Harin(dim.), Ruzz(ruzzy,aun), Thanabodee(jum)and Ekachai(tonc),had their own band with two other friends, making a total of six members.

Later, upon graduation, the band members dispersed to continue their studies. Thanabodee went to Thammasat University.
