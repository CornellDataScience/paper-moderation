Vatican Media's main goal is the universal expansion of Catholicism  by creating television materials and broadcasting images of the pope and of Vatican activities.


== Programs ==
Programs are mainly based on what happens in the Vatican. Daily prayers such as Angelus, general audiences on Wednesdays, and various celebrations are broadcast. The pope's travels around the world are also broadcast.
Each year, CTV broadcasts around 130 events in the Vatican and covers daily public activities of the pope and his main activities outside the Vatican.
Octava Dies is a weekly magazine of 25 minutes broadcast in the entire world since Easter 1998. It is also broadcast by Italian Catholic television channels and by press agencies such as APTN. It is available in English and Italian on the Vatican's website (broadcast every Sunday at 12:30 after the Angelus).


== Broadcast (Vatican Television Center) ==
Live broadcasts are made on the Vatican's website and by other Italian Catholic television channels such as Telepace or TV2000, and foreign television channels such as EWTN and KTO. The Vatican does not have its own television station. Vatican Media provides images to other television channels of events in the Vatican itself or papal activities around the world. Within Vatican City, it assists in organising press centers and press conferences, and also provides for special reporters and audio-video services for foreign television channels. "It conducts around 130 live broadcasts per annum, produces documentaries, creates a weekly magazine program called Octava Dies that is distributed internationally, and serves as an archival facility for all of its footage. On Sundays the station uses Intelsat to broadcast the pope's Angelus to the United States."


== Production ==
Vatican Media produced many documentaries during the reigns of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. It made documentaries on the lives of the popes, on the Vatican City, and on the main churches of Catholicism. They were mainly broadcast in Italian but also in English, Spanish, French and other languages.


== Archive center ==
Vatican Media owns a library of more than 10,000 recordings, amounting to 4,000 hours of recordings and images of Pope John Paul II's reign since 1984. This library is open to foreign television channels and documentary producers from throughout the world. The Vatican Media Center is open Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
