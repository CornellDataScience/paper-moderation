== Early life ==
Jacques André Simonet was born on the Boulevard Port-Royal in Paris on 13 July 1941.

Three years later, Perrin enrolled in acting classes at the Conservatoire National Supérieur d'Art Dramatique.

His first film role was an un-credited part in the 1946 film Les Portes de la nuit. It wasn't until 1957 that he again appeared on film, this time in a credited role in 'La Peau de l'ours.
It was while performing in a production at the Conservatoire National Supérieur d'Art Dramatique that he was noticed by the Italian director Valerio Zurlini. Zurlini was impressed enough with his talent to  cast him in his first lead role, as a juvenile falling for a helpless  Claudia Cardinale in the 1960 romantic drama La Ragazza con la valigia. Perrin became one of Zurlini's favorite actors acting for him in the role of Marcello Mastroianni's brother in Cronaca Familiare (1962) which was internationally released  under the title Family Diary.
He then played roles in films by Henri-Georges Clouzot (The Truth in 1960) and Mauro Bolognini (Corruption in 1963), and leading roles in four films by Pierre Schoendoerffer: La 317e Section (1965), Le Crabe-tambour (1977), A Captain's Honor (1982) and Là-haut, un roi au dessus des nuages (2004).

In 1973, he produced the first film by Benoît Lamy, Home Sweet Home in which he starred alongside Claude Jade as his love interest. The movie received 14 international awards.

The film won the Grand Prix du Cinéma Français. He was cast as the adult Salvatore in Cinema Paradiso (1988), an international success.
Perrin then devoted himself to making nature documentaries. He was the producer of Microcosmos in 1995 and producer and co-director of Winged Migration in 2001, Océans in 2009 and Seasons in 2015.
On screen, Perrin played the part of the old Pierre Morhange, narrator of the internationally successful film The Chorus, which he also produced. The young Pépinot was played by his son Maxence.
