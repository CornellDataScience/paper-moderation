Pachycephala is a genus of birds native to Oceania and Southeast Asia. They are commonly known as typical whistlers. Older guidebooks may refer to them as thickheads, a literal translation of the generic name, which is derived from the Ancient Greek terms pachys "thick" + kephale "head". This lineage originated in Australo-Papua and later colonized the
Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos to the west and the Pacific archipelagos to the east.


== Taxonomy ==
The genus Pachycephala was introduced in 1825 by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Vigors with the Australian golden whistler as the type species. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek pakhus meaning "large" or "thick" and kephalÄ“ meaning "head".

=== Former species ===
Formerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus Pachycephala:

Maroon-backed whistler (as Pachycephala raveni)
Little shrikethrush (fortis) (as Pachycephala fortis)
An unidentified Pachycephala whistler was heard on May 14, 1994 at 1,000 meters ASL south of the summit of Camiguin in the Philippines, where the genus was not previously known to occur. It might have been an undescribed taxon, or simply a vagrant of a known species.
