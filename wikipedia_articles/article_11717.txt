The Nature Coast is an informal, unofficial region of the U.S. state of Florida. The broadest definition of the Nature Coast includes the eight counties that abut the Gulf of Mexico along the Big Bend Coast defined by geologists: from west to east, Wakulla, Jefferson, Taylor, Dixie, Levy, Citrus, Hernando, and Pasco counties. (Note that the Big Bend Coast differs from the Big Bend region of Florida.) The name "Nature Coast" was originally devised as part of a marketing campaign to promote tourism in Levy, Citrus, Hernando, and parts of Marion and Pasco counties.
Many businesses and organizations incorporate "Nature Coast" in their names, but most of them do not explicitly define the region, or define a smaller region. For instance, the Nature Coast State Trail, which is officially designated as part of Floridaâ€™s Statewide System of Greenways and Trails, is located in Dixie, Gilchrist and Levy counties. The Nature Coast Aquatic Preserve includes 800 square miles (2,100 km2) of coastal water in Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties. The Nature Coaster website covers only Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties.
The lower southern end (Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus County) are often considered part of the Tampa Bay Area.
Activities common in this area include hunting, fishing, boating, bird watching and nature hiking. Snorkeling spots are found in the rivers along the Nature Coast. Diving and manatee tours are available, predominantly in areas such as Crystal River, Homosassa and Homosassa Springs.
The Nature Coast is home to wildlife including deer, wild pigs, roseate spoonbills, alligators, raccoons, opossums, snakes, great blue herons, egrets, turtles and at least 19 endangered species.
There are also 50 golf courses in the area.
