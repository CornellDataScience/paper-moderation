=== Activities ===


==== Marching Band ====

The marching band is a nationally recognized field show marching band.
The first director of the Victor J. Andrew High School Marching band was Patrick Culler in 1977. During Culler's tenure, he wanted his band to strive for excellence and the current principal wanted the band to start competing. Thus, the band started competing in 1979. Later in 1982, Dan Romano inherited the band program including the marching band and all concert bands; he directed the program until 2010.
In the 1980s, the band struggled both financially and in its performance. Romano decided to try a new approach, and after many years the band began to see success in their marching competitions. He is known for starting the band's tradition of reciting their motto, "feet together, shoulders back, chins up, and eyes with pride" before taking the field.
In 1987, the Victor J. Andrew High School Marching Band started going to band camp at Pilgrim Park, a church camp located in Princeton, Illinois (Near Peoria, Illinois). Since then the band annually goes to Pilgrim Park to prepare for the upcoming season. While they're there they learn marching drill, visuals, marching techniques and keep trying to improve their music.
The Victor J. Andrew High School Marching Band has attended many Bands Of America competitions. During their fall season they have traveled out of state to Cincinnati, Ohio, Centerville, Ohio, Pontiac, Michigan, St. Louis and Indianapolis, Indiana. They also attend many competitions in state. These have included Illinois State University Marching Band Invitational, Lake Park Joust, Amos Alonzo Stagg Band  Jamboree, Lincoln Way East Marching Band Invitational, Mount Prospect Marching Knights. Knight of Champions Marching Band Competition, and Wheeling Marching Band Competition. Every year starting in 2010 (every other year from 1994 to 2008) the band competes in BOA Grand National Championships, held in the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. During their spring season they have traveled to California, Nashville, and Orlando, Florida. While in Orlando, the band usually competes in parades and concert performances. The band travels to Orlando every three years. The band has also performed in the 6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade and in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
In 2009, Dan Romano directed his last show, called Reflections. He retired later that year and is now going back to school. The current band director is Mark Iwinski, who marched in the band while he was in high school.
The Winter Percussion Ensemble is a 12 time Winter Guard International Finalist. The Ensemble has won 2 gold, 3 silver, and 2 bronze medals since 2011.


===== Relay For Life Fundraiser =====
The district also has a Relay For Life event that donates money towards the American Cancer Society. In 2010, the Relay For Life of District 230 raised nearly $400,000. This placed them first in the state of youth events and boosted the event to the second-largest youth event in the country. This 2nd in the nation was behind one large university, Virginia Tech. The relay has been going on for the past 13 years and was the first event of its kind in the country.
