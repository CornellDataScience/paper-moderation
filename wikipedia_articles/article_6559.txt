== Reception ==

In a contemporary review for The New York Times, critic Frank S. Nugent wrote: "Aside from its theme, the Paramount offering has little to recommend it. There are a few brief moments when the spectator entertains some hope that the picture is getting into the farce stride, but the promise is not kept; the film sags painfully. It resorts to a number of dull and more than faintly reminiscent situations, and the dialogue sparkles but seldom."
Wolfe Kaufman of Variety wrote that Grant was "brutally miscast" but Rob Wagner of Script wrote that he was "particularly pleased" with Grant, comparing him to Clark Gable in It Happened One Night with his ability to "surprise everyone with his delightful flair for light comedy."
