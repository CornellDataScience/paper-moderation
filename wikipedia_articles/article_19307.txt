The 385th's 2nd Battalion crossed the Nims River at Niederweis taking the town while the 1st Battalion attacked south between Nims and the Prum toward Irrel.   3rd Battalion was the first of the regiment to span the Sauer and go into action in Germany.  The first days of combat were a series of pillboxes and prepared defenses until the Line had been breached and the Regiment began moving at an ever-accelerated speed.
