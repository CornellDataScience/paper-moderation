Verbunt's Australian representative debut came in 2022 when she was selected in the Australian U21 squad to contest the Trans-Tasman series of match races against New Zealand youth crews. The Australian team were victorious on overall points and brought back the Rusty Robertson Trophy.
In March 2023 Verbunt was selected in Australian women's squad for the 2023 international season. At the Rowing World Cup II in Varese, Italy she steered the Australian women's eight. They led from the start in the A final and won the gold medal.  At 2023's RWC III in Lucerne, the eight was unchanged. In the final they led through to the 1500m mark but finished in third place for the bronze medal. For the 2023 World Rowing Championships in Belgrade Serbia, the Australian women's eight was unchanged aside from some seat shifts in the bow end with Verbunt again in the stern. They finished 2nd in their heat and needed to proceed through a repechage which they won. In the A final they led through the first 1000m on a low rating of 37/38 but were rowed through by the high-rating Romanians and a fast finishing USA eight. The Australians won the bronze medal, a 3rd place world ranking and Paris 2024 qualification.
