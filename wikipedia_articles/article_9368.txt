Considered one of the best duos in the league, Brown and Tatum are both NBA All-Stars. They have led the Celtics to six Eastern Conference Finals, two NBA Finals, and one NBA championship.

== Background ==
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum both played one year in college. They were briefly together during Team USA camps, before joining the NBA.
Meanwhile, by 2016, the Boston Celtics had been rebuilding for years, since the collapse of their "Big Three" in 2012–13. Upon Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum being drafted third overall in back-to-back years, the Celtics were "almost instantly branded with the hopes of a franchise that was desperately chasing its elusive 18th championship".
