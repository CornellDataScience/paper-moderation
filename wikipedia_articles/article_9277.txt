The Grambling State Tigers are the college football team representing the Grambling State University. The Tigers play in NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) as a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. They were known as Grambling Tigers until 1973, when the university changed its name from Grambling College to the current one.
The prominence of Grambling football is longstanding. The Tigers, under Hall of Fame coach Eddie Robinson, who guided them to 408 victories in 55 seasons from 1941 to 1942 and 1945 to 1997, were built as a small-school powerhouse with more than 200 players who played professional football.
On September 24, 1976, Grambling State and Morgan State became the first collegiate football teams from the United States to play a game in the continent of Asia.  Grambling State defeated Morgan State 42–16 in Tokyo, Japan.  In fall 1977, the Grambling State Tigers were invited back to Tokyo where they defeated the Temple Owls 35–32 in the inaugural Mirage Bowl game.
Among its accomplishments include: 15 Black college football national championships (tied for second most in HBCU history) and 27 Conference Championships (one Midwest Conference & 26 SWAC).  The Tigers have won the most SWAC Championships to date.
