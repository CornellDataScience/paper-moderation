He was born in Edinburgh on 6 March 1839 the son of Elizabeth Allan Thomson and her husband, Andrew Douglas Maclagan, a surgeon. He lived his early years at 129 George Street in Edinburgh's New Town.

Alongside his medical career he was a military volunteer and held the rank of Colonel with the 5th Battalion Royal Scots.

== The Maclagan Manuscripts ==
The Maclagan Manuscripts are an important collection of folklore, customs and beliefs, which Robert Maclagan collected between the years 1893 and 1902. He worked in a team of dedicated collectors, in the West Highlands and they collected a huge amount of material, that covers topics as diverse as folk medicine, customs and beliefs, hero tales, material culture, rhymes and children's games, recipes and weather lore, place-name legends, the natural world and much more. Dr Robert Craig Maclagan published some of the material in a number of articles and books. The manuscript itself totals more than 9000 pages and is held in the University of Edinburgh School of Scottish Studies Archive. Some of the manuscripts have been digitized and are available to view online. The collection he amassed is significant because it gives us a window into the life of men and women in the 19th century in the Highlands of Scotland.
