The Secretary of the Security Council of RF is the head of the Security Council office and the national security advisor to the Russian President. The Secretary is appointed by and reports directly to the President.
The Secretary organizes the work of the Council, attends Council meetings and coordinates the security policy of the Russian government. However, the role has been a de facto sinecure position for those who have served as heads of security agencies. For instance, Vladimir Rushailo served as interior minister of Russia from 1999 to 2001.
The office is not de jure a powerful position, and its influence significantly depends on who holds it. Former secretary Nikolai Patrushev was described as being one of closest advisors to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was key in influencing Putin to invade Ukraine in 2014 and in 2022.
Former defense minister Sergei Shoigu has served as Secretary since May 12, 2024.
