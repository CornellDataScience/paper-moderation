The 2019–20 Primera División Femenina de Fútbol was the 32nd edition of Spain's highest women's football league, the 19th since the inception of the Superliga Femenina.
On 6 May 2020, the Royal Spanish Football Federation announced the premature end of the league due to the COVID-19 pandemic, revoking relegations and naming Barcelona as league champions five years after their last title. Also, it was approved the expansion of the league to 18 teams for the 2020–21 season.


== Overview ==
Round 9 was postponed due to a strike of the players claiming for a collective agreement to improve their work conditions.


== Teams ==

Deportivo and Tacón promoted from Segunda División. Both teams made their debut in the top tier and replaced Málaga and Fundación Albacete, that were relegated as the two last qualified in the previous edition.
