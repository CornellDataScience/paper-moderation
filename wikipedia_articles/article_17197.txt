== Career ==


=== Writing ===
Torgersen was born April 6, 1974. His first public credit was as an unpaid script writer for locally-produced space opera serial Searcher & Stallion, which broadcast on Salt Lake City community radio KRCL FM in the early 1990s. "Footprints" was published in North Seattle Community College's 2002 Licton Springs Review.
In 2009, his story "Exanastasis" won third place in the third quarter Writers of the Future contest. Torgersen's first professional sale occurred shortly thereafter, when editor Stanley Schmidt bought Torgersen's novelette "Outbound" for Analog Science Fiction and Fact, and the story was selected in the Analog AnLab readers' poll for Best Novelette for 2010. His novelette "Ray of Light" was the cover story on the December 2011 issue of Analog and was nominated for both the Nebula Award and the Hugo Award. He was also nominated for the 2012 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer.
Torgersen received two nominations for the 2014 Hugo Awards: for the novella "The Chaplain's Legacy" and the novelette "The Exchange Officers". "The Chaplain's Legacy" also won the 2014 AML Award for Short Fiction. The Chaplain's War, published by Baen Books in October 2014, took his Analog stories "The Chaplain's Assistant" and the AnLab-winning "The Chaplain's Legacy" and expanded them into a fix-up novel. During the 2015 Hugo nomination and voting period, Torgersen led the Sad Puppies movement, which claimed that popular works were often unfairly passed over by Hugo voters in favor of more literary works, or stories with progressive political themes.
He won his third Analog AnLab readers' choice award for the novelette "Life Flight". In December 2018, Baen published A Star-Wheeled Sky, which won the 2019 Dragon Award for "Best Science Fiction Novel". In February 2020 Brad was the Literary Guest of Honor and Keynote Speaker at the 38th annual Life, the Universe, & Everything professional science fiction and fantasy arts symposium.
