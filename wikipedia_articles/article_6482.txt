A general election was held in the U.S. state of Wyoming on Tuesday, November 2, 1926. All of the state's executive officers—the Governor, Secretary of State, Auditor, Treasurer, and Superintendent of Public Instruction—were up for election. Republicans narrowly picked up the governorship and solidified their control on the other statewide offices, increasing their margin of victory in each race.


== Governor ==

Incumbent Democratic Governor Nellie Tayloe Ross ran for re-election to a second term. She was narrowly defeated for re-election by Republican Frank Emerson, the Wyoming State Engineer.


== Secretary of State ==
Incumbent Republican Secretary of State Frank E. Lucas, who briefly served as acting governor following the death of William B. Ross, opted to run for Governor rather than seek re-election. Former Campbell County Clerk Alonzo M. Clark defeated former State Senator John Stansbury for the Republican nomination, while businessman W. S. Kimball won the Democratic nomination unopposed. In the general election, Clark defeated Kimball by a decisive margin to win his first term as Secretary of State.

Incumbent Republican State Auditor Vincent Carter, first elected in 1922, ran for re-election to his second term. He faced newspaper editor Joe U. Allard, the Democratic nominee, in the general election. Despite the closeness of several other statewide races, Carter was able to improve on his margin of victory and defeated Allard in a landslide. He would not serve out his full term, however, following his election to Congress in 1928.

Incumbent Republican State Treasurer John M. Snyder declined to seek re-election to a second term. To replace him, former State Representative William H. Edelman, the Republican nominee, ran against C. H. McWinnie, the State Public Lands Commissioner and the Democratic nominee. Though Snyder's margin of victory in 1922 was close, Edelman ultimately defeated McWinnie by a wide margin.

Incumbent Republican Superintendent of Public Instruction Katharine A. Morton ran for re-election to a third term. She was opposed by Cecilia H. Hendricks, the Democratic nominee. Morton easily dispatched Hendricks to win re-election in a landslide, and in so doing, won the highest percentage of the vote of any candidate in the state in 1926.
