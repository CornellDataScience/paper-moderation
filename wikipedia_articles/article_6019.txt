Ethnic religions (also "indigenous religions" or "ethnoreligions") are generally defined as religions which are related to a particular ethnic group (ethnoreligious group), and often seen as a defining part of that ethnicity's culture, language, and customs (social norms, conventions, traditions). In an ethnic religion, the ethnic group and its beliefs system cannot be easily separated. Oftentimes an ethnic religion's doctrine only pertains or is directed to that group. A common trait among ethnic religions is that they are closed to outsiders, limiting themselves to members born into the group. This is opposed to universal religions, which are open to all peoples and actively pursue and accept converts.
