APEC leaders endorsed the Pittsburgh G20 principles and agreed to implement the policies of the G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth, further expanding the global commitment to achieve more balanced growth that is less prone to destabilizing booms and busts.

APEC leaders announced their commitment to accelerate economic integration and, to that end, endorsed a U.S.-Australia initiative in APEC to promote cross-border services trade in the region.


=== Facilitating Trade ===
APEC leaders took steps to facilitate increased trade in the region by simplifying complicated customs procedures and documentation resulting from the region's numerous trade agreements, improving the region's enforcement of intellectual property rights, and speeding the movement of goods across and within borders.  They also announced an action plan designed to make it 25 percent cheaper, easier, and faster to conduct business in the region by 2015 by decreasing costs and streamlining processes associated with starting and operating a business in APEC economies.
