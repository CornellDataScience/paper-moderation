The 2024 Massachusetts State Senate election was held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, with the primary election held on Tuesday, September 3, 2024. Massachusetts voters elected all 40 members of the State Senate to serve two-year terms in the Massachusetts General Court. The election coincided with United States national elections and Massachusetts state elections, including U.S. Senate, U.S. House, U.S. President, and Massachusetts House.
Democrats started the 2023 legislative session with 37 members. However, Democratic Senator Anne Gobi resigned on June 4, 2023 and Republican Peter Durant won the subsequent special election, flipped the district for his party, and assumed office on November 29, 2023. Therefore, Democrats hold a supermajority of 36 seats compared to the four seats held by Republicans. Republicans would have to net 17 seats to flip control of the chamber.
