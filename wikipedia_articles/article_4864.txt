Football Club Bunyodkor (Uzbek: Bunyodkor futbol klubi) is an Uzbek professional football club based in Tashkent that competes in the Uzbekistan Super League.
Bunyodkor, a relatively unknown club at the time, made international headlines when it claimed to be close to signing world-famous Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o, although he did not eventually sign with them. On 25 August 2008, AEK Athens Brazilian superstar Rivaldo announced to the Greek press that he was joining Bunyodkor on a reported $14 million two-year contract.
The club finished second in the 2007 Uzbek League season and made the semi-finals of the 2008 AFC Champions League. In the beginning of August 2008, the club changed its name to Bunyodkor from PFC Kuruvchi to reflect the club's success on the pitch and its increasing professionalism off the pitch.
Bunyodkor competed in the AFC Champions League for 10 consecutive tournaments from 2008 to 2017. Only Pakhtakor has participated in more tournaments from the Uzbekistan Super League.


== History ==

Bunyodkor, which means "creator" in Uzbek (and originally from the Persian بنیادکار| bonyad-Kar), was created on 6 July 2005, with the name Neftgazmontaj-Quruvchi, which was typically abbreviated "Kuruvchi" (the Uzbek word for "builder"). In 2005, the club played initially in the championship of Tashkent region and played its way into the playoff for promotion into the First League, the second level of Uzbek football. Kuruvchi gained promotion that year, its first, and under the management of Khikmat Irgashev, Kuruvchi won the First League in its first attempt, winning 27 of 38 matches with 5 draws and 6 defeats.
With its victory in the second level of Uzbek football in 2006, the 2007 season was Kuruvchi's debut in the Uzbek League. Never before had a club moved with such alacrity from the lower reaches of Uzbek competition into the top league. In club's first season Bunyodkor finished runner-up after Pakhtakor Tashkent.

=== Famous signings ===

On 14 July 2008, the club, then called Kuruvchi, announced through their official website that they had signed Barcelona star Samuel Eto'o on a six-month contract. The story was confirmed by Bakhtiyor Babaev, the club's sporting director, stating that it was a performance-related contract. He also went on to say that the Cameroonian football star would sign on 17 July, and that the transfer had taken place due to the good relationship enjoyed between both clubs' presidents. Despite this, Barcelona official spokesperson denied any knowledge of the transfer, stating "I don't think it's very likely".
On 16 July 2008, the Uzbek radio Maxima reported that Davut Kivrak and Barcelona managers are expected to arrive in Tashkent to hold talks with the Uzbek Football Federation and to promote youth football (Barcelona and Bunyodkor have a yearly renewable deal to help in youth football). The following day, Eto'o confirmed that he was thinking of joining Kuruvchi – the team stated that they would have confirmation on whether Eto'o would join the team on 23 July 2008.
Shortly thereafter, Bunyodkor and Barcelona managements announced that the two clubs had reached an agreement to play a friendly in Tashkent and the Uzbek side will be able to train at Camp Nou.

Just a couple of days after Eto'o's visit to Tashkent, two other players from Barcelona visited the team – Andrés Iniesta and Carles Puyol, as well as Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fàbregas.
Although unsuccessful in obtaining Eto'o's services by September 2008, Bunyodkor brought two famous Brazilians to Tashkent: Rivaldo as a midfielder and Zico as manager. Rivaldo signed a contract that he termed "very good for the end of my career" to play for Bunyodkor. Three weeks later, his countryman Zico signed on to manage the club on a one-year deal.
