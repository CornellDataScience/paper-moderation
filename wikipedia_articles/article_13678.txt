The 1991–92 NBA season was the 46th season of the National Basketball Association in New York City. In the off-season, the Knicks hired Pat Riley as their new head coach; Riley previously coached the Los Angeles Lakers two years ago. The team also acquired Xavier McDaniel from the Phoenix Suns, signed free agent Anthony Mason, and selected point guard Greg Anthony out of UNLV with the 12th overall pick in the 1991 NBA draft. Under Riley, the Knicks showed improvement as they held a 30–16 record at the All-Star break. At midseason, the team traded Brian Quinnett to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for James Donaldson. The Knicks finished second in the Atlantic Division with a 51–31 record.
Patrick Ewing led the team with 24.0 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team and NBA All-Defensive Second Team, was selected for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game, and finished in fifth place in Most Valuable Player voting. In addition, John Starks played an increased role as the team's sixth man, averaging 13.9 points per game off the bench, while McDaniel provided the team with 13.7 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. Gerald Wilkins contributed 12.4 points per game. Mark Jackson provided 11.3 points, 8.6 assists and 1.4 steals per game, while Mason also played a sixth man role, averaging 7.0 points and rebounds per game each, off the bench, and Charles Oakley contributed 6.2 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. Riley finished in second place in Coach of the Year voting.
In the Eastern Conference First Round of the playoffs, the Knicks eliminated the Detroit Pistons in five games. In the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, the Knicks faced off against the defending champion Chicago Bulls for the second straight year. The Knicks frustrated the Bulls and Michael Jordan with their physical play, winning Game 1 on the road, 94–89, and then winning Game 6 at home, 100–86 to tie the series at 3–3. However, the Knicks lost to the Bulls in seven games as the Bulls–Knicks rivalry was born. The Bulls would defeat the Portland Trail Blazers in six games in the NBA Finals, winning their second consecutive championship.
Following the season, McDaniel signed as a free agent with the Boston Celtics after only playing just one season with the Knicks, while Jackson was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, Kiki Vandeweghe signed as a free agent with the Clippers, Wilkins signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Donaldson was released to free agency.
