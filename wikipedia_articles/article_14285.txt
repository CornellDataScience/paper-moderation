The Musul or Muzul Territory is thought to have been a Postclassic polity of the former Maya Lowlands, in present-day Belize. Little is currently known of the Territory, though it is presumed to have been subordinate to or formed part of the Dzuluinicob Province or the Mopan Territory.


== Geography ==
The Territory is thought to have stretched east of Tipu, south of the Belize River, and north of South Stann Creek, thereby encompassing the drainage basins of Sibun River, North Stann Creek, and Sittee River. This would situate the Territory south and east of Dzuluinicob, northeast of Mopan Territory, and north of Manche Chol Territory.


== History ==


=== Pre-Columbian ===
It has been suggested that Tipu and its environs formed part of the Territory until Columbian times, when the Spanish conquest of Yucatan is thought to have driven troves of northern, Yucatec Mayan speaking refugees to the area, an event which would have relegated native residents to minority status.


=== Columbian ===
The Territory is thought to have been under the close political, cultural, or spiritual influence of the Peten Itza Kingdom.
At least some of the Territory came under Spanish control in 1695 when an embassy to Merida, Yucatan, offered the Spanish governor submission to Church and Crown. Another part of the Territory was subjected to forced relocation during Spanish reducciones in 1754â€“1756.


== Society ==
The Territory's residents, the Muzul Maya, are thought to have been members of a single ch'ibal, 'patronymic lineage,' that is, 'a highly localised group named after their dominant political family.' Inhabitants are believed to have been some of the indios del monte, 'wild Indians,' often referred to in Spanish colonial records, ie pagan natives residing south of Belize River with a mother tongue other than Yucatec Mayan.


== Legacy ==
Little is presently known of the Territory or its inhabitants. Along with residents of the former Mopan Territory, they are thought to be ancestors of the modern Mopan Maya people of Belize and Guatemala.
