The Norwegian Campaign, lasting from 9 April to 10 June 1940, led to the first direct land confrontation between the military forces of the Allies—the United Kingdom and France— against Nazi Germany in World War II.


== January 1940 ==
27: German planners assign the code name Weserübung to the operation.


== February 1940 ==
5: Using assistance to Finland as rationale, the Allied Supreme War Council decides on intervention in Norway. Initial plans are for a landing at Narvik, and success would rely on the acquiescence of Norway and Sweden. It is clear that despite the stated rationale, cutting supplies of iron ore to Germany is a prime motivation for the plan.
16: The British destroyer HMS Cossack intercepts the German tanker Altmark in neutral Norwegian waters, freeing 303 British internees (captured merchant sailors) and killing 8 German sailors. The Altmark Incident makes public the attitude of the Allies toward intervention in Norway, and provides impetus to German planners to accelerate their plans.
21: General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst is appointed to command the invasion of Norway. He will command German forces in Norway until 1944.


== March 1940 ==

3: The date for invasion is set for 17 March 1940, although this is later delayed to April.
28: The Allies decide to begin mining Norwegian waters (Operation Wilfred), and to send a military force to Norway to pre-empt German aggression. The Allies assumed that Wilfred would provoke a German response in Norway and prepared a separate operation known as Plan R 4 to occupy Narvik and other important locations. The end of the Winter War deprives the Allies of their primary excuse for the operation. Mining operations are set to start on 5 April 1940, but this is moved back to 8 April 1940 due to disagreements with France about the associated Operation Royal Marine.

German air-landed soldiers land at and capture the airport at Oslo.

The Narvik landing force evades British naval forces and defeats the Norwegian vessels in the fjord.

The Germans have ten destroyers defending and both sides lose two ships, with the German force suffering greater damage beyond that to other vessels.
