== History ==


=== Indian Rebellion of 1857 ===
During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, 282 sepoys of the 26th Native Infantry mutinied at Lahore and subsequently surrendered, believing they were going to be given a fair trial. They were summarily executed without trial by Frederick Henry Cooper, then–deputy commissioner of the district. The bodies were dumped into a deep dry well near the police station which was later filled with charcoal, lime, and dirt. In March 2014 the head of a local Sikh gurdwara announced that the remains of those buried had been uncovered in the excavation of a well within the shrine. The well is known as Shaheedan da Khu in the Punjabi language, which means "the martyrs’ well".
