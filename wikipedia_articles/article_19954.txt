== History ==
Most of the Hindus in Assam belongs to the Ekasarna sect of Vaishnavism which is the dominant faith of the region since its formation from 15th–16th century in Brahmaputra valley, Assam. The Ahom kings during their 600 yrs rule in Assam, have increasingly patronizing Hinduism alongside the proselytizing activities of Ekasarana Dharma since the 16th-century—a large section of the Bodo-Kachari peoples converted to different forms of Hinduism in the 17th–18th century and a composite Assamese consisting of caste-Hindus, tribals began to form. Suhungmung, was the first Ahom king who have converted into Hinduism and adopt a Hindu title, Swarganarayana during that medieval period of ahom rule. But some sources also argue that Jayadhwaj Singha was the first Ahom king who have formally accepted Hinduism. Rudra Singha was the first who announced publicly of his inclination towards Hinduism and consequently later on he became a disciple of a Hindu Brahman priest. The historical roots of the Hindu religion in Assam dates back to at least 4th–7th centuries when  Varman dynasty were ruling in the region. Vedic sacrifices such as the Ashvamedha and other Brahmanical rites and rituals were prevalent in this region during that period. However, the Varman kings of Assam came mostly from non-Hindu tribal backgrounds, and the form of Hinduism that developed in the Assam region has long been a complex negotiation link between Sanskritic traditions with indigenous tribal practices and beliefs. Before the arrival of Hindu religion in the fertile valley of Brahmaputra, Majority of ethnic Assamese people practiced an indigenous religion known as Ahom religion, followed by Bodo people who professed Bathouism and various ethnic tribals like : Karbi, Dimasa, Mising and Rabha were practitioners of Animism prior to the coming of Hinduism in the valley.

The Vaishnavism which is a prominent sect of Hinduism in Assam do not believe in idol worship and perform "Naamkirtan", where the glory of formless Lord Vishnu is recited and chanted. There are two important cultural and religious institutions that influence the religious fabric of Assam: the "Satras", is a site of religious and cultural practice and the "Namghar", the house of prayers where religious people meet and pray together as a community.
