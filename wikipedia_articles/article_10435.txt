== Final Catwalk Order ==


== Order of elimination ==


=== Notes ===
1 – This contestant was initially going to be in danger of elimination, but the results of the live challenge saved her from elimination.
2 – This contestant was initially safe from elimination, but the results of the live challenge caused her to be in danger of elimination.
3 – During gala 07, there was no live challenge, and only the two girls in danger faced the risk of elimination. The rest of the contestants were put through simultaneously during the first elimination, and individually during the second elimination.
Each judge may give the contestant a score that ranges from 1-10. There are three judges, meaning that the greatest possible score is 30 points.
Elimination and weekly ranks are determined by the public vote. The three contestants with the fewest votes from the public each week, are within danger of elimination. Contestants may escape the danger zone if they receive a high score from the judges for their performance at the live challenge, and if their added scores are high enough. In contrast, contestants that were initially safe, may have to face the risk of elimination if they receive a low score from the judges, and fall below the line of safety.
