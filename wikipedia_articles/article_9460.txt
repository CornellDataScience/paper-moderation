== Reception ==
The series received mixed to negative reviews. Lucy Mangan of The Guardian awarded the first episode two stars out of five, praising the opening but stating, 'If you are suffering from a tension pneumothorax yourself and can’t reach the remote control, or if you are a great devotee of the game Who’s Marked Next For Death?, it’s an OK watch. For the rest of us, there’s lots of other stuff to be getting on with, I’ll bet.' Anita Singh in The Telegraph also gave it two stars out of five, comparing it to a soap opera. Nick Hilton from The Independent gave the first episode two out of five stars, lambasting the writing but praising Hawes.
James Jackson of The Times gave it three stars.
