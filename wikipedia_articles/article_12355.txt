In mathematics, a group is said to be almost simple if it contains a non-abelian simple group and is contained within the automorphism group of that simple group – that is, if it fits between a (non-abelian) simple group and its automorphism group. In symbols, a group 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 is almost simple if there is a (non-abelian) simple group S such that 
  
    
      
        S
        ≤
        A
        ≤
        Aut
        ⁡
        (
        S
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\leq A\leq \operatorname {Aut} (S)}
  
, where the inclusion of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  
 in 
  
    
      
        
          A
          u
          t
        
        (
        S
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Aut} (S)}
  
 is the action by conjugation, which is faithful since 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  
 is has trivial center.


== Examples ==
Trivially, non-abelian simple groups and the full group of automorphisms are almost simple. For 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        5
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=5}
  
 or 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        7
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq 7,}
  
 the symmetric group 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{n}}
  
 is the automorphism group of the simple alternating group 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
          
            n
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {A} _{n},}
  
 so 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{n}}
  
 is almost simple in this trivial sense.
For 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        6
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=6}
  
 there is a proper example, as 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
          
            6
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{6}}
  
 sits properly between the simple 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
          
            6
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {A} _{6}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Aut
        ⁡
        (
        
          
            A
          
          
            6
          
        
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (\mathrm {A} _{6}),}
  
 due to the exceptional outer automorphism of 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
          
            6
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {A} _{6}.}
  
 Two other groups, the Mathieu group 
  
    
      
        
          
            M
          
          
            10
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {M} _{10}}
  
 and the projective general linear group 
  
    
      
        
          PGL
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        9
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {PGL} _{2}(9)}
  
 also sit properly between 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
          
            6
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {A} _{6}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Aut
        ⁡
        (
        
          
            A
          
          
            6
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (\mathrm {A} _{6}).}
  


== Properties ==
The full automorphism group of a non-abelian simple group is a complete group (the conjugation map is an isomorphism to the automorphism group), but proper subgroups of the full automorphism group need not be complete.


== Structure ==
By the Schreier conjecture, now generally accepted as a corollary of the classification of finite simple groups, the outer automorphism group of a finite simple group is a solvable group. Thus a finite almost simple group is an extension of a solvable group by a simple group.
