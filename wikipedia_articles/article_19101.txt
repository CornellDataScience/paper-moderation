Andi Sex Gang (born Andreas Graham McElligott) is the founder, vocalist and main songwriter of the band Sex Gang Children who were a prominent act in the gothic rock movement of the 1980s. His band played at the infamous Batcave club in 1982. He has also recorded as an experimental solo artist.
McElligot lived in London squats before entering music, and was involved in leftist activism. He formed the band in early 1982. In the late 1980s, McElligot obtained the rights to the material he had released with the band and controls its licensing. Over the years, he had a number of conflicts with a number of record companies.
In 2011, a documentary, Bastard Art, by Vince Corkadel presented an overview of his career.
