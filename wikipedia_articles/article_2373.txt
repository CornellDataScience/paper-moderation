Wellington Paranormal is a New Zealand mockumentary comedy horror television series which first aired on 11 July 2018 on TVNZ 2. The series is a spin-off of the 2014 film What We Do in the Shadows and first television series in the franchise, and its lead characters—Officers Minogue and O'Leary—first appeared in the film as a pair of incurious police officers.


== Production history ==
The series was created by Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement and Paul Yates based on characters from What We Do in the Shadows by Clement and Waititi. Waititi and Clement serve as the series' executive producers, while Clement directs four of the six episodes in Series 1. The series was confirmed for a second series of 13 episodes, which aired 6 episodes beginning on 16 October 2019.
A Christmas special aired on 19 December 2019, with the remaining six episodes airing as a second series. Between the special and third series, a sixteen-episode digital web series and public service campaign by New Zealand Police to inform the public on health, safety, and best practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, titled Important COVID-19 Messages from Wellington Paranormal, began airing from 26 March 2020, featuring Andrew Coster and Clarke Gayford as themselves. The lead characters also appeared as part of a 2018 New Zealand Police Recruitment video, and four 2018 Police Safety campaign videos. The third series premiered on 24 February 2021.
Jemaine Clement stated in June 2021 that the fourth series was in post-production. He added: "We're pausing on [Wellington Paranormal], we're not sure we'll be back for a fifth [series]", while discussing a new series that he and Waititi are currently developing. The fourth series premiered on 16 February 2022, following a sneak peek confirming that it would be the final series.

== Reception ==
Clarke Gayford's appearance on a short Wellington Paranormal video in April 2020 encouraging people who were looking after young children during the COVID-19 pandemic drew some criticism due to his relationship with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. National Party Member of Parliament Brett Hudson alleged during an Epidemic Response Committee meeting in early May 2020 that the video risked "politicising" the New Zealand Police. In response, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster defended Gayford's participation on the grounds that he was a well-known television personality who had participated in the television series.
