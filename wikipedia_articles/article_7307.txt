The Sound and Music Computing (SMC) Conference is the forum for international exchanges around the core interdisciplinary topics of Sound and Music Computing. The conference is held annually to facilitate the exchange of ideas in this field.


== Focus topics ==
This sections speaks briefly about subfields related to Sound and Music Computing, for the main article, see Sound and music computing.
Sound and Music Computing (SMC) is a research field that studies the whole sound and music communication chain from a multidisciplinary point of view. The current SMC research field can be grouped into a number of subfields that focus on specific aspects of the sound and music communication chain.

Processing of sound and music signals: This subfield focuses on audio signal processing techniques for the analysis, transformation and resynthesis of sound and music signals.
Understanding and modeling sound and music: This subfield focuses on understanding and modeling sound and music using computational approaches. Here we can include Computational musicology, Music information retrieval, and the more computational approaches of Music cognition.
Interfaces for sound and music: This subfield focuses on the design and implementation of computer interfaces for sound and music. This is basically related to Human Computer Interaction.
Assisted sound and music creation: This subfield focuses on the development of computer tools for assisting Sound design and Music composition. Here we can include traditional fields like Algorithmic composition.

== The SMC Summer School ==
Each year, along with the conference, the SMC summer school is conducted. It promotes interdisciplinary education and research in the field of Sound and Music Computing. It is aimed at graduate students working on their Master or PhD thesis, but it is also open to any person carrying out research in this field.
