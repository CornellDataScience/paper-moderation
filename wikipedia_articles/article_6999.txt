=== 2019–2020: Post–Tawag ng Tanghalan and controversial TNT winning announcement ===
After the second round performance between Osabel and Mariko Ledesma, Ledesma took the seat of power, dethroning Osabel. However, after the winning moment, the screen appeared where the split scoring was revealed (showing the public and judges scores), and viewers noticed that Osabel's score given by the judges was 16.50%, while Ledesma received 50%. Due to the allegedly "rigged" results, netizens used #JusticeForMariane or #HustisyaParaKayMariane and it trended on Twitter, citing the expression, rants and sentiments over the score given by the judges.
On September 14, 2019, three days after the performances of Osabel and Ledesma, which aired on September 11, 2019, Tawag ng Tanghalan judge Dulce spoke about the controversial result of Ledesma dethroning Osabel, saying that Osabel sounded different live than what was broadcast, but failing to explain the impossibly low-scoring. Others involved said that the public didn't know what went on behind the scenes or the pressure the judges were under.
After the recent controversial result, Osabel withdrew from competing in the Final Resbak due to health problems, while Mariko, who was one of the grand finalist for Huling Tapatan, also withdrew her slot for personal reasons caused by the netizens backlash against her. In 2021, according to a virtual interview in LionHearTV, Osabel became traumatized after not winning in TNT and she was afraid to join singing contests.


=== 2021: The Clash ===
In 2020, the year after her Tawag ng Tanghalan journey, and despite the controversy, she auditioned for the third season of The Clash, but she wasn't able to pass. She re-auditioned during Season 4 in 2021 and finally received the call to compete for the fourth season.
Osabel participated in the fourth season of The Clash. She was dubbed as "Ultimate Siren ng Iligan City". On her One on One round, she sang "Paraisong Parisukat" by Basil Valdez, where she advanced on the second round. In the grand finals of the competition, she fought against Vilmark Viray on a one-on-one clash where she performed an original composition "Bakit Mahal Pa Rin Kita", composed by Harish Joya, while Viray performed "Umuwi Ka Na". Osabel ultimately became the grand champion of the fourth season of the Philippine reality singing competition The Clash.
