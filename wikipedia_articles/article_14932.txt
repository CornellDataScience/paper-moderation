== Reception ==
A contemporary review by AllMusic described the album as "derivative" but that Nelson sings "rhythmically in his smooth voice, negotiating the rock & roll beat with far greater ease than Pat Boone" and that he "display[s] the combination of natural pop instincts and genuine rock & roll feel that set him apart from the burgeoning pack of Elvis Presley imitators"
