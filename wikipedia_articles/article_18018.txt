Alfred Inigo Suckling (1796–1856), surname originally Fox, was an English clergyman, an author and historian of Suffolk.


== Life ==
Born on 31 January 1796 in Norwich, he was the only son of Alexander Fox, by his wife Anna Maria (née Suckling, d.1848), daughter of Robert Suckling of Woodton in Norfolk, by his wife, Susannah Webb, a descendant of Inigo Jones. Robert Suckling, his maternal grandfather, was of an old Norfolk family, which counted among its members the poet Sir John Suckling and Horatio Nelson's uncle, Maurice William Suckling. On the death of Robert's son, Maurice, without issue on 1 December 1820, Alfred Inigo took the surname and arms of Suckling and succeeded to the estates.
He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he  matriculated in May 1814  and graduated LL.B. in 1824. He was ordained at Norwich on 15 October 1820. On 10 July 1839 he was instituted on his own petition to the rectory of Barsham in Suffolk, which he held until his death.
He devoted most of his life to topographical depictions of Suffolk and Essex, his most notable work being the monumental 'History and Antiquities of Suffolk'.
He died at 40 Belmont Road, St. Helier, Jersey, on 3 May 1856 and is buried in Jersey.
