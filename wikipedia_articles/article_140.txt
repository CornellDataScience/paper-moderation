Give the Drummer Some is the debut solo studio album by American drummer Travis Barker. Barker had earlier announced that the album would be slated for a September 14, 2010 release, but was later pushed back, with the album being released on March 15, 2011. The album, released under Interscope Records, was produced by the drummer himself, alongside The Neptunes, RZA, Kool Kojak, Chuck Inglish, Transplants, Kid Cudi, edIT, Corey Taylor and Steve Aoki. The album debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 28,000 copies in the United States.


== Background ==
The album title itself is a reference to a track by the Ultramagnetic MC's of the same name, which in turn derives from James Brown's "Funky Drummer." The album cover was created by Pushead. It was first announced by Barker himself that the album would be of "no one genre," indicating that the album wouldn't be based on hip hop or punk rock, unlike his previous remixes and collaborations. However, most of the tracks are hip hop and R&B influenced, though for instance "Misfits" has a techno and dance sound and "On My Own" has a metal groove to it. Guests that collaborated and are featured are: Slaughterhouse, The Cool Kids, RZA, Ludacris, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Game, Raekwon, Tom Morello, Slash, Steve Aoki, Busta Rhymes, Lil Jon, Pharrell, Tech N9ne, Cypress Hill, Twista, Jay Rock, Kobe, Paul Wall, Clipse, Kid Cudi, Yelawolf, Snoop Dogg, Lupe Fiasco, Swizz Beatz, and Bun B. Barker confirmed in an interview that there will not be any collaborations with Mark Hoppus and Tom Delonge from Blink-182 as he thought it would be wrong to have the first new Blink-182 song on his album, and that the song will be released separately as a single before the album is released in Juneâ€“July 2011. The track listing was revealed on February 25, 2011.
