== History ==


=== Foundation ===
As a part of welfare activities of the British-Indian government, on 1 July 1947 the government of Jeypore Estate  (Orissa Province) under Maharaja Vikram Deo Verma started this institution of higher education at Jeypore as 'Jeypore College'. As a tribute to his philanthropy the college was renamed to 'Vikram Deb College' in 1961. The college was also upgraded to a first grade college from 1961 and undergraduate courses were started. Honours teaching provisions were made in 1968–73 and Post Graduate courses were started from 1979. The college was declared a lead college in 1991–92. 


== Upgradation and expansion (1961-2023) ==
In 1961, a significant milestone was achieved by Vikram Dev College as it was upgraded to a First Grade College.
To further broaden its academic offerings, the college introduced undergraduate classes in Science and Humanities streams in 1961 and 1963, respectively. This expansion allowed students to pursue a wide range of disciplines and facilitated their holistic development.
Recognizing the importance of specialized knowledge and advanced studies, the college implemented honors teaching between 1968 and 1973. This step aimed to provide students with a deeper understanding of their chosen subjects and promote research-oriented learning.
In 1979, Vikram Dev College took a significant leap forward with the initiation of post-graduate studies in the Department of History. This move provided a platform for aspiring scholars to engage in in-depth research and contribute to the field of academia.
Building upon the success of the post-graduate program in History, the college expanded its offerings in subsequent years. Post-graduate studies were introduced in Economics, Commerce, and Political Science in 1983 and 1990, respectively. These programs enriched the academic landscape of the college and attracted students with a passion for these disciplines.
Recognizing the need to provide comprehensive education from the early stages, in 1983, Vikram Dev College introduced higher secondary streams in Arts, Science, and Commerce. This development allowed students to pursue their desired subjects right from their higher secondary education, fostering a seamless transition into higher studies.
The year 1993-94 witnessed another milestone in the college's journey as post-graduate studies in Chemistry were initiated. 
The year 2023 marked a momentous occasion for Vikram Dev College. In response to heavy demand from students, academics, and the general public, the college was declared an affiliating university by the Chief Minister of Odisha Mr. Naveen Patnaik on 2 February 2023. This declaration took place one day before the college's platinum jubilee celebration, signifying not only its remarkable history but also its commitment to fostering higher education and academic growth in the region. The university came into function from 1 June 2023.
