There were 28 boys and 19 girls enrolled on the first year with two teachers. The medium of the language was only English.
But with the intention of putting up a boys only school, the school was renamed to St. Anne's Boys College in 1881, with the guidance of the Kurunegala parish priest Adrian Dufo, during the term of Apostolic Vicariate of Jaffna Bishop Christophe Ernest Bonjean. The number of pupils on roll in 1881 was 101 and the first headmaster was B. S. Peterson.
It was on the invitation and recommendation of C. L. W. Perera that the De La Salle Brothers acceding to the request of the Archbishop, assumed duties at St. Anne's College on 1 December 1934 after purchasing the present land of 49,000 square metres (12 acres) for Rs. 15,000. The arrival of the De La Salle Brothers to the city, paved the way for the awakening of both discipline and quality education.
Hugh Ferrington was the first Director of the institution. He formed the Old Boys Association in 1935 and on 9 June of the same year the old Boys Day was inaugurated and then on 1 March 1940, The President Of the Old Boys Association is Attorney at Law, Felician Perera, the son of C. L. W. Perera. The first prize-giving was held in the open air under the directorship of Casimir Ernest, a Czech Brother.
