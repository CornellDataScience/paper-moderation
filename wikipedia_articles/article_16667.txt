Gordon Ramsay: Cookalong Live is a British cooking show starring Gordon Ramsay.  Originally conceived as a one-off episode, Channel 4 later commissioned a full series for late 2008. A Christmas special aired on 25 December 2011 and a second on 25 December 2012.


== Background ==
The original episode was part of The Big Food Fight, a January 2008 promotion featuring Channel 4 shows starring Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Gordon Ramsay.  On live television, Ramsay invited the entire nation to prepare a three course meal for four with him in just under 60 minutes  Ingredients and instructions were available on the official site to help viewers prepare for the event at home. Often, he would teach viewers basic cooking techniques, such as chopping an onion or boning a chicken.
The show was expanded to a seven-episode series for autumn 2008, and began on 24 October 2008.  Each week Ramsay prepared a themed menu ranging from curry night to a 1970s theme, and even participated in a challenge with that episode's celebrity guest in cooking a dish chosen by the celebrity.
