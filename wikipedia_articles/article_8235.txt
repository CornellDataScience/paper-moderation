In the Company of Angels II: The World Will Sing is the seventh major release from Caedmon's Call. It was released on March 7, 2006 through Essential Records.


== Background ==
In 2001 acoustic folk/pop group Caedmon's Call released In The Company of Angels: A Call to Worship. The album was celebrated as one of the best selling titles in the Caedmon's catalog, scanning 250,000 units to date. Caedmon's followed up with In the Company Of Angels 2: The World Will Sing featuring a blend of familiar praise and worship choruses, along with original songs written by the band. To this day the members of Caedmonâ€™s Call have remained active in their home churches, this project takes that experience to a national platform. While In the Company of Angels: A Call to Worship focused on a local community of believers, In the Company of Angels 2: The World Will Sing illustrates the band's heart for sharing and ministering to the rest of the world.
