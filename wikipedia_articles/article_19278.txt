=== Playing career ===
A goal kicking fullback, Davidson played for the City Rovers between 1915 and 1923 in the Auckland Rugby League competition. Even as a young player his goal kicking became well known. In 1914 when he was still in the City 2nd Grade team he was reported thus: "this boy, Davidson, of City, is said to be a remarkable place kicker and half a dozen goals in one afternoon has been no uncommon achievement for him this season. He kicks them from all angles and all ranges, and many old players and officials have described him as easily the best goal kicker in Auckland". He made his first grade debut in Round 1 of the 1915 season and scored a try, however because of his age he was deemed still too young (18) for the top side and spent the rest of the year in City's champion second grade team. At the end of the season he was selected in the three quarters for the Junior Auckland side to play Junior Waikato.
Davidson represented Auckland and scored 5 tries in his debut against Canterbury. He also played in a 1919 defeat of Australia, a 1920 victory over the Great Britain Lions and a 1923 tour of the South Island.

In 1919 he was first picked for New Zealand, playing against the touring Australians. He played his second test match in 1920, against Great Britain.
In 1922 he played for Auckland against the touring New South Wales team where Auckland lost 40 points to 25. He played against the same team days later for the Auckland Provincial team who also went down by 21 points to 20.
