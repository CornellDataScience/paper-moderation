Littman spent four years at Boston College studying communications. In his senior year, Littman served as one of three captains on the team as the Eagles qualified for the NCAA final eight. He ended his season with .912 saves and a .895 percentage. In 2000, his BC record of 2,548 career saves was broken by Scott Clemmensen. As a result, he was selected for the AHCA East Second-Team All-American. He was drafted in the eleventh round, 211th overall, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres.


=== Professional ===
Littman attended the Sabres training camp but was reassigned to their International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans, to begin the 1989–90 season. However, the 1990–91 would prove to be a breakout season for him. On January 29, 1991, Littman made his NHL debut by replacing Darcy Wakaluk in the second period. Littman saved 15 of 18 shots in an 8–3 loss to the St. Louis Blues. Upon their return to the IHL, both Littman and Wakaluk also set a new Rochester record for most points and assists by a goaltender with seven each. He was also selected for the 1991 All-Star Game. Littman shared the Harry "Hap" Holmes Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding goaltender, with teammate Darcy Wakaluk.
The following year, he was again the recipient of the Harry "Hap" Holmes Memorial Award.
On August 28, 1992, Littman signed with the new NHL expansion team, the Tampa Bay Lightning. Although he began the season in the minor leagues with the Atlanta Knights, Littman was recalled to the NHL in November 1992. His stay in the National Hockey League was short-lived and he was reassigned to the IHL. He became a free agent at the end of the season.
As a result of his successful stints with the Atlanta Knights, Littman was selected to compete with Team USA at the 1994 IIHF World Championship, where they finished fourth in the tournament. Before his retirement, Littman played with the IHL's Orlando Solar Bears, recording 53 wins over two years before a career-ending knee injury.
