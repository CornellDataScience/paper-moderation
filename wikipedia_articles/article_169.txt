Sacred Heart College was a Roman Catholic all girls' school in Ballarat, Victoria. The school was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1881 and closed in 1994 preceding the amalgamation of the College with St Martin's in the Pines and St Paul's Technical College to form Damascus College Ballarat.
In 1906 the primary students were moved to St Francis Xavier College.
In 1960 Alice Fanning bequeathed property in Mt Clear to the Sisters of Mercy. In 1967 the land was developed for a senior school for the girls, named St Martin's in the Pines. In 1968 the Year 11 and 12 students of Sacred Heart moved to the campus at Mt Clear, which became co-educational in 1988.
Former Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks was a teacher at the school.
Today the College and convent are used for ghost tours by a Daylesford company.
