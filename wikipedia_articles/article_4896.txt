== Synopsis ==
Hidden dungeons are a place of legends where rare treasures and items are concealed. Some are lucky to find them, like Noir Stardia, the third son of a minor noble family, who acquires an exceptional skill that provides him great knowledge. As a result, however, it causes him to have painful headaches. Noir is given a job offer by his childhood friend Emma Brightness, who has a cure for his headaches. After Noir encounters difficulty with employment, he wishes to become an adventurer and finds a dungeon and the legendary adventurer, Olivia Servant, who has been trapped inside for centuries. Olivia gives Noir three powerful skills, which he uses to improve his power and enroll at the Hero Academy.

Noir Stardia (ノル・スタルジア, Noru Sutarujia)
Voiced by: Ryōta Ōsaka (Japanese); Zeno Robinson (English)
Noir is the third son of a baronet, a noble of the lowest rank, who is a self-proclaimed coward who would like to take it easy. Upon not receiving a job as a librarian due to interference from more prominent nobles, Noir begins his journey to become a hero seeking other employment through attending the adventurer's/hero academy. He is originally born with the rare [Great Sage] Skill, which grants him unlimited knowledge for a time, but gives him terrible headaches after each use, so he refrains from using it until he learns from Emma that kissing her helps alleviate some of the pain. During an exploration of a secret dungeon, he meets Olivia, who bestows him the power to freely upgrade his and other people's powers [Create], [Bestow], and [Edit] by expending LP (Life Points), which are obtained by having joyful experiences but at the risk of dying if his LP is fully depleted.
Emma Brightness (エマ・ブライトネス, Ema Buraitonesu)
Voiced by: Miyu Tomita (Japanese); Lizzie Freeman (English)
Emma has known Noir since they were young. She willingly allows Noir to kiss her, which helps relieve his [Great Sage] aftereffects. She initially started a part-time job as a librarian to work beside Noir only to find he did not get it and then quits shortly afterward to take the heroes exam with Noir just to stay by his side. Emma loves Noir and plans to marry him.
Lola Metrose (ローラ・メトラーゼ, Rōra Metorāze)
Voiced by: Rumi Okubo (Japanese); Anne Yatco (English)

Olivia Servant (オリヴィア・サーヴァント, Orivia Sāvanto)
Voiced by: Yui Horie (Japanese); Janice Kawaye (English)
Olivia is an adventurer who becomes Noir's master, helping him to grow stronger in hopes that one day he can become powerful enough to break her free from the Death Chains.
Luna Heela (ルナ・ヒーラー, Runa Hīrā)

Luna is a half-elf saintess/cleric who is Lola's best friend. She is introduced into the story as a solution towards solving the curse of a duke's daughter who happens to go to same adventurer's school as Noir and Emma. As a famous cleric, her skills are quite unique with her being one of very few with curse purification skills; it initially shortened her lifespan, but Noir alters it to instead decrease Luna's finances.
