The Akwa Ibom Transport Company (AKTC) is a state-owned transportation company headquartered in Uyo, Nigeria. Established in 1988, the company was founded shortly after the creation of Akwa Ibom State in 1987 to facilitate the conveyance of civil servants within the state. Over the years, AKTC has expanded its operations to include inter-state transport services. The company operates a fleet of buses, providing transportation for passengers and cargo across various routes. Despite challenges such as high operational costs and infrastructure issues, AKTC has stabilised transport fares and supported commuter welfare.


== History ==
The Akwa Ibom Transport Company (AKTC) was established in 1988, shortly after the creation of Akwa Ibom State in 1987. The increase in the number of civil servants who lived outside the heart of Uyo or its suburbs led to the government's decision to provide transport for civil servants to and from work. Initially, the company inherited buses from the former Cross River State after the creation of Akwa Ibom State. The new transport company aimed to provide effective and efficient transportation services to the public.
To improve operations, AKTC was leased to private operators in 2005. The first lease was for 16 years, followed by a second lease currently ongoing for 25 years. Despite these efforts, issues such as service quality, high transportation fares, poor infrastructure, a limited number of vehicles, insufficient drivers, and inadequate driver training persist.


== Management and structure ==
The Akwa Ibom Transport Company Limited is an autonomous parastatal of the State Ministry of Works and Transport. The company is led by a General Manager/Chief Executive who is appointed by and reports to the State Governor. The company employs 2,335 workers of various categories, with an average of five workers per bus.
AKTC comprises several departments and units, including Internal Audit, Monitoring, Planning, Research, Training/Terminal/Maintenance, Store, and Revenue. These departments manage the company's human transport resources. Despite this structure, the company faces challenges related to technical expertise and staffing quality, which management is addressing through training programs.


== Operations ==
AKTC maintains a fleet of 83 vehicles, including 70 functional and 13 unserviceable ones. The fleet includes various models such as Peugeot mini buses, Fiat Bureau Buses, and Mercedes models (MB0365, M/B 608D, M/B 911 Mobile Workshop). The company operates 21 routes, including nine inter-state routes to cities like Abuja, Kaduna, Lagos, Yola, Kano, Jos, Port Harcourt, Calabar, and Aba.
AKTC has provided commercial buses, increased the number of vehicles for commercial service in the state, and stabilised transport fares. The company has transported over 7.3 million passengers since its inception and operates affordable fares, helping to stabilise prices in the transport sector. AKTC has also influenced private operators to adopt a consumer-oriented approach, enhancing the transport environment in the state.


== Challenges and prospects ==
AKTC faces challenges such as the high cost of procuring new vehicles and spare parts, inadequate workshop efficiency and maintenance culture, excessive demand for vehicles, and persistent overloading, which leads to vehicle depreciation and a shorter lifespan.
Despite these challenges, AKTC has made notable achievements, such as providing commercial buses, moving goods and people, offering affordable fares, stabilising transport fares, and enhancing commuter welfare. The company also provides transport facilities, such as bus stop signs, terminals, and substations, and organises periodic training programs for drivers on road safety and accident prevention.
