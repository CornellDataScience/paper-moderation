== Reception ==
Sridevi S of The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "If you are a fan of commercial films, Head Bush has the right ingredients to offer, that if you can manage to sit through the slow first half". 
Muralidhara Khajane of The Hindu  wrote "Despite being a well-written gangster drama that marries a political thriller, poor character writing and execution trouble this Dhananjaya film". Y Maheshwara Reddy of Bangalore Mirror gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "For a peek into the 1970s, this film is a must-watch".
Vivek M V of Deccan Herald gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "The makers stay clear of any standpoint. It's also not right to expect the entire truth in a biopic. But is it too much to ask for a team filled with potential to deliver to its fullest?" Shuklaji from The News Minute gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "Head Bush, as a film and the first episode of a potential long series, promises a lot but delivers on very, very little because the film, unfortunately, is consumed by its own lack of clarity". 
A. Sharadhaa of Cinema Express gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "Overall, Head Bush highlights crime, friendship, and family, and makes for a perfect outing for lovers of gangster films".


== Controversy ==
The film became controversial because of a scene that allegedly insults Veeragase, a folk dance form of Karnataka. In a film sequence, a character refers to the Dharmaraya chariot as "jijubi" (useless). Sathish, a trustee of the Dharmaraya temple, said that the community was offended by the scene and urged the makers to remove it. He also claimed that the chariot shown in the movie is not a real one and further offered to provide the makers with actual footage of the chariot.
