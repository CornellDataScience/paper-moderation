== Plot ==
Present team Arrow are shocked that future team Arrow has travelled back in time. William Clayton tells his father Oliver Queen that the year is meant to be 2040. William's half-sister Mia Smoak and Connor Hawke decide not to tell present team Arrow about the dystopian future of Star City under the interests of preserving their timeline, but William doubts that they can keep this a secret for long. Oliver wants to connect with his children's future selves; he is able to restore his bond with William, but Mia keeps her distance out of resentment. The next day at the bunker, the two teams watch a newscast of the Deathstroke gang. The future team believes the gang leader is John Diggle Jr. and go to confront him, only to realize it is Grant Wilson. Grant plants bombs but Oliver and the rest of the present team manage to save the future team.
Connor and William reveal everything to the present team, resulting in Rene Ramirez and John Diggle, and later Diggle and Connor arguing. Laurel Lance and Mia go to the hospital and Laurel realizes that Mia is going to try and kill Grant. Grant plans to use coordinated bomb attacks, and has them all connected to a phone. Both teams suit up and try to find Grant. Once they do, Mia is going to kill him but Oliver stops her from doing so. The next morning, Oliver takes Mia to his father Robert's grave and tells her that he did not know his true father until he had died; he does not want to be like that between them. Oliver then gets a call from Curtis Holt who says that there is a weapon that can defeat Mar Novu but the man who can make it is in Russia. Laurel exits the SCPD and Novu appears before her. He offers to bring back Earth-2, but it will require a simple task: she must betray Oliver.

=== Critical response ===
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating for the episode, based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 8.45/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The future is brought into the "Present Tense" in an emotional Arrow installment that provides Stephen Amell with some of his most resonant material yet."
Allison Shoemaker of The A.V. Club rated the episode A−, saying, "It's a fine Arrow plot, kind of vague but mostly effective. It doesn't matter, anyway—it's just a means to an end. The real meat of the story exists in the conversations between these people, and the presence of the Deathstroke gang makes those conversations about a thousand percent more interesting." Delia Harrington of Den of Geek  described it as "fun-ass television" and "a tremendous step forwards". She complimented all the callbacks to season 2 and Stephen Amell's acting stating that he is "(he) has done some of his best work so far this season, and this episode tops it all. "
Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode 7.1 out of 10, noting that the Deathstroke of 2019 suffers as the actor is not very enthusiastic about the role.  Schedeen praised Amell's performance and the strong material he is given to work with.
