== Development ==
Little Green Men Games developed Starpoint Gemini 2 based on the community feedback and suggestions in the Steam Early Access program. Although most of the popular suggestions made it in the game, some of the ideas could not be implemented in Starpoint Gemini 2. The feature requests not suitable for Starpoint Gemini 2 were kept on a wishlist and became the base of the new spin-off title Starpoint Gemini Warlords. Just like its predecessor, Starpoint Gemini Warlords went through Early Access where the developers implemented feature suggestions from their community and changed the game according to their feedback. The game was scheduled to stay approximately 6 to 12 months in Steam Early Access and was finished and released after 11 months. It was released for Windows via Steam on 23 May 2017 and for Xbox One on 9 February 2018.
