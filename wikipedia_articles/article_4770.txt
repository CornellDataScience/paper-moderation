== Plot ==
FBI agent Zach Stewart is assigned three new cases by his boss, John Ripley, which are added to his existing case load. One involves wanted fugitive Joe Walpo, who has killed a gas-station attendant. Another concerns a department store fashion buyer, Kate Martell, who is being extorted by a man threatening to kill her daughter. A third has to do with a gang of thugs who hijack cars.
While interviewing a woman of concern Stewart was shot dead by a hidden assailant.  With the assistance of local L.A.P.D. detectives Ripley picks up Stewart's new cases, thinking that one of them may reveal the identity of Stewart's murderer.
Ripley and his new partner trail Connie Anderson, a girlfriend of Walpo's, to his hideout, where Ripley shoots him. They tie up the car-jacking case and are then able to narrow down who the killer of the FBI agent must be.
They follow Kate to the "Hollywood" sign in the hills above Los Angeles, where she has been told to bring the money. There the extortionist is revealed to be a man named Milson who had shown a romantic interest in Kate, leading to a confrontation with Ripley.
