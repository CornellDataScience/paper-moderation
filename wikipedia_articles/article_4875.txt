The Informational Agency "Panorama", shortened to Panorama, is a Russian-language satirical website which publishes satirical "news" on topical regional and international issues. It is analogous to the American digital media company The Onion. The Panorama has been known for using its articles by many famous Russian public figures and the media as real news, even though each article on this website is accompanied with the note "The text is a grotesque parody and is not real news".


== History ==
The website became operational in 2017. The project was founded by two people under the pen names of Boris Gontermakher and Vitaly Mann.
In an interview given in August 2020, Boris Gontermakher stated that the founders expected to teach Russian media and readers to fact check, but the goal was not met.
In another interview given in October 2021, Boris Gontermakher and Vitaly Mann said that they self-identified as liberals, but did not support modern left-wing ultra-liberalism.
According to Novaya Gazeta, Panorama's articles increasingly depict real news related to Russian politics. This is associated with the general degradation and exaggeration of political life in Russia.

Boris Gontermakher – editor-in-chief
Vitaly Mann – correspondent
Brazhek Zgolchich – storeman


== Financial situation ==
The Panorama is a project that is funded only on a non-profit basis. The founders needed to gain money.
