== Critical reception ==
AllMusic wrote: "Part of the reason [the Zippers] stand apart from the rest of the neo-swing crowd is that they don't forget that there was a bit of menace in the days of hot jazz -- it wasn't a naive, swinging party, there was some genuine hedonism as well." Entertainment Weekly's review called the band "adept but inconsequential," writing that Katharine Whalen's "sleepy Billie Holiday cadences verge on satire." Spin called the album "self-congratulatory, jokey, essentially heartless cartoon music masquerading as 1920s 'hot jazz'." The Houston Press deemed it "a dozen rock-solid originals that represent the band's finest and most ambitious collection to date."
