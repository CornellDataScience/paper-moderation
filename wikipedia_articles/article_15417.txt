== Plot ==
Najma and Shakeel love each other and want to marry. However, Najma's father is against this marriage as Shakeel belongs to a poor family. Najma then decides not to marry as her father is a heart patient. When her father learns that she has decided to never marry because of Shakeel, he suffers a fatal cardiac arrest. After her father's death, she works hard and becomes a doctor.
On the other hand, Shakeel doesn't understand her reason not to marry and blames her considering her unfaithful. Nadira, Shakeel's class fellow who also likes Shakeel and belongs to a rich family becomes close to him after Najma's departure. She teases Shaeekl when Najma doesn't come to him and in return, he slaps her.
One day, Shakeel's mother has a road accident with Najma's car. Najma brings her to the hospital with an engineer which disturbs Shakeel and he blames her, falsely considering that she has married. On the deathbed, Shakeel's mother advises him to marry Nadira and she considers him a good woman for her son. In this way, they get married and after their marriage, Nadira's behavior changes completely and she reveals it to Shakeel that she has just married him to avenge his earlier slap. Shakeel then leaves home, falls on the road due to weakness and is taken to the clinic where Najma (who is a doctor in the clinic) discovers that he is suffering from Tuberculosis. She decides to bring him back to a healthy life and for this purpose, she takes the help of Shahid, Shakeel's close friend. Najma disguises herself as a nurse and looks after him, considering that he hates her now and will not even like to see her. Shahid also tells him about Najma that she has not yet married due to him and she was compelled just like he was, due to his mother's last wish. When he recovers completely and leaves the hospital, Najma sings the same song that he used to sing for her from which he realises that she is her Najma and both reunite.
