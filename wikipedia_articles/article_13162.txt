The Subaru Crosstrek (Japanese: スバル・クロストレック, Hepburn: Subaru Kurosutorekku, also known as the Subaru XV globally for the first two generations) is a compact crossover SUV produced by Subaru since 2012. It is a successor to the Outback Sport in the United States and Canada, and the Impreza XV globally. Like the Outback Sport, the Crosstrek is a lifted Impreza hatchback with minor differences, though with a more substantial lift than the Outback Sport.
Initially, the vehicle was marketed as the XV globally, and as the XV Crosstrek in the United States and Canada. In 2015, Subaru dropped the XV moniker in the United States and Canada, marketing it simply as the Crosstrek for the 2016 model year and onward. In 2022, Subaru introduced the third-generation model, using the Crosstrek nameplate globally for the first time.
All generations of the Crosstrek are raised versions of the Subaru Impreza hatchback.


== First generation (GP; 2012) ==


=== Concept ===
Subaru showcased the Subaru XV concept vehicle in 2011. Based on a raised suspension version of the Subaru Impreza 5-door hatchback, the XV concept offered aluminum alloy wheels with silver spokes, black wheels and clear blue center caps; yellow-green body color, silvery white leather interior upholstery at seats, mesh in selected interior areas with yellow/green piping, multifunction display with navigation, car audio, and vehicle information in the center panel; EyeSight driving assist with stereo cameras and LCD monitor between the two combination meters, 2.0-liter four cylinder horizontally-opposed DOHC engine, Lineartronic CVT, and 245/45 ZR19 tires. The concept vehicle was unveiled at Auto Shanghai 2011.


=== Production version ===

The production version of the XV was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. This model went on sale in Japan on 25 September 2012. It was introduced in the United States as the XV Crosstrek for the 2013 model year at the 2012 New York International Auto Show. It is powered by the FB20B engine making 148 hp (110 kW) (in the United States), sharing powertrain specifications with the Impreza. It included 17-inch wheels, as well as roof rails and tinted glass. All trims, along with all Subaru vehicles (excluding the BRZ), included Subaru's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system, with Lineartronic CVT equipped models being able to send 100% of torque to the wheels with the most traction. A 4.2 inch touchscreen and backup camera were included on the Limited trim, along with the all-weather package with heated seats. All trims had driver's auto up/down windows. All trims had six-way manual adjustment for the drivers seat (height, recline, forward/back), and four-way manual adjustment for the front passenger (forward/back, recline). 

For the 2014 model year, a Hybrid version was released in the North American markets in two trims, the higher of which had new features with some of these being optional on the non-Hybrid Premium and Limited trims.For the 2015 model year, reversing cameras and 6.2 inch head units were added to all trims, as well as an upgraded electric power steering system. The Limited trim got an insulation-glass windshield, optional keyless ignition, an upgraded instrument cluster which included a color Liquid-Crystal Display. Upgraded mirrors with welcome lighting and turn signals were added as well. The then-new Starlink multimedia plus system with a 7.0 inch display that debuted on the 2015 Subaru Legacy and Outback was included as well. The Premium, Limited and Hybrid trims could be optioned with Subaru EyeSight and Hybrid models gained a PIN code access system. A special edition variant based on the premium trim with Sunrise Yellow paint was also available, but limited to 1,000 units.

For the 2016 model year, the Premium trim received the all weather package with two-level heated front seats and heated mirrors as standard equipment, along with the option of Subaru's Starlink Safety and Security system (standard on the Limited) including an SOS button, automatic collision notification system, stolen vehicle recovery, and a vehicle monitoring app. The Limited trim got rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot monitoring, and lane-change assist. This year also included revised styling and the removal of the XV prefix from the name in the United States and Canada. It was also the last year of the Hybrid model.
The 2017 model was largely unchanged, with the only change being a new trim, which was the Platinum Special Edition (which could be considered an option package to the Premium trim). Included was special interior and exterior styling, a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.
Despite being a lifted Subaru Impreza hatchback, sales have been much stronger in the US, due to sedan/hatchback sales slowing in the country.


==== Other markets ====
Malaysian production of the Subaru XV shipped as complete knock-down kits began at Tan Chong Motor Assemblies Sdn. Bhd (TCMA) in Malaysia in January 2013, with annual production of 5,000 units destined for sale in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, while the Philippine market Subaru XV are imported from Japan as a LHD (left-hand drive) configuration. Production at Tan Chong began on 20 December 2012.
Early European models include a choice of 1.6-liter gasoline, 2.0-liter gasoline, 2.0-liter diesel engines; five-speed manual (1.6-liter gasoline), six-speed manual (2.0 gasoline, 2.0 diesel), Lineartronic CVT (1.6 gasoline, 2.0 gasoline) transmission, and idle engine start stop (standard in gasoline engine models, optional in diesel engine models).
In North America, the XV was sold as the Subaru XV Crosstrek and was unveiled at the 2012 New York International Auto Show. The US model went on sale in 2012 as a 2013 model year vehicle. Early models include a 148-horsepower 2.0-liter boxer engine, five-speed manual or available second-generation Lineartronic CVT. In the United States starting with the 2016 model year, Subaru dropped the XV from its name and sold it as simply the Crosstrek. An updated model based on the fifth-generation Impreza became available in 2018.


=== Hybrid version ===

The Subaru XV Crosstrek Hybrid (2013) is a version of the Subaru XV Crosstrek with permanent magnet AC synchronous motor rated 10 kW (14 PS; 13 hp) and 65 N⋅m (48 lb⋅ft), Lineartronic CVT, Nickel hydride batteries, and 225/55 R17 tires. Externally, "HYBRID" badges have been applied to the front doors and on the rear liftgate, and unique rear lights and wheels are exclusive to the hybrid version. The vehicle was Subaru's first production hybrid after a series of concepts stretching back to the 2003 B9 Scrambler, and was unveiled at the 2013 New York International Auto Show. Compared to the conventionally-powered XV Crosstrek, a new gauge cluster and keyless start have been added to the hybrid, which gains approximately 300 pounds (140 kg) in weight. The 0.6 kW-hr battery (weighing 55 pounds (25 kg) by itself) takes the space previously occupied by the spare tire, minimizing the loss of cargo space. Using the battery alone, range is estimated at 1 mile (1.6 km) at 25 mph (40 km/h). The 10 kW generator-motor is built into the Lineartronic CVT, similar to the "turbo-parallel-hybrid" system first shown on the Subaru B5 TPH concept, and is intended to be used primarily for acceleration assistance and regenerative braking. Fuel consumption is improved by approximately 11%, from 28 mpg‑US (8.4 L/100 km; 34 mpg‑imp) (combined city/highway) to 31 miles per US gallon (7.6 L/100 km; 37 mpg‑imp).
For the 2014 model year, the XV Crosstrek Hybrid was introduced in two trims, the XV Crosstrek Hybrid and Hybrid Touring. The base Hybrid model included the Limited's features, MPG of 29 city, 33 highway, removes the leather interior, and added different wheels, grill shutters, quick-ratio electric power-steering, side mirrors with signal repeaters, keyless ignition, chrome door handles, and an upgraded multi-function display, along with more power (up to 160 hp (120 kW) and 163 lb⋅ft (221 N⋅m) of torque). The Hybrid touring included a sunroof, leather, a navigation system with voice controls, Aha radio, HD radio, Satellite radio, and a 6.1 inch head unit. The Premium and Limited trims could be equipped with the upgraded head unit and a sunroof.
For 2015, Hybrid trims had their MPG increased to 30 city, 34 highway.

In 2016, after Subaru dropped the XV prefix from the model name in the United States and Canada, the model was known as the Crosstrek Hybrid. In Japan, a STI version of the XV Hybrid was offered with the suspension tuned to provide better handling. Externally, the XV Hybrid tS ("tuned by STI") can be distinguished by orange accents on the front spoiler, side skirts, and roof spoiler. It was sold for a limited time spanning the last half of 2016.
The model was discontinued after the 2016 model year.

== Second generation (GT; 2017) ==

The second-generation Subaru XV ("Crosstrek" for the North American market) was unveiled at the Geneva International Motor Show in March 2017. Like the Impreza, the XV/Crosstrek has moved to the Subaru Global Platform. Minimum ground clearance is 220 mm (8.7 in) and matte black cladding has been added to each side to add a "rugged flavor", creating "a dynamic form expressing all the enjoyment to be expected from a crossover vehicle". During its first full month of sales, the XV sold 11,085 vehicles in Japan.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== North America ===

The second-generation Crosstrek in North America uses the revised direct-injection FB20D gasoline engine with 152 hp (154 PS; 113 kW) and 196 N⋅m (20 kg⋅m; 145 lb⋅ft) output. The base transmission was changed to a 6-speed manual transmission as opposed to the 5-speed in the first generation. The interior quality was upgraded, and a new 6.5-inch Subaru Starlink infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality was standard, with an 8.0 inch system and navigation being available on the Limited trim. While navigation was an option, all trims could use Apple Maps, Google Maps (via CarPlay and Android Auto respectively). Magellan Navigation is also available on all trims via the Starlink app, though the optional navigation is the only system that does not use the driver's smartphone to get map data, and is the only system that displays speed limits in the gauge cluster. Auto up/down windows were for the first time included for the passenger side (previously only on the driver's side). The Starlink Safety and Security system was made standard on the Premium trim. Models optioned with Eyesight got adaptive high beams. The Limited trim got adaptive LED headlights, keyless ignition and entry, an optional Harman Kardon was available and a 6-way power driver's seat was included. Subaru's X-MODE off-road assist function was also added.
For 2019, the Crosstrek received Eyesight on all models equipped with the CVT transmission. The Hybrid trim was reintroduced as a Plug-in Hybrid, based on the Toyota Prius Prime's Hybrid system. Power was reduced to 148 hp (150 PS; 110 kW), and combined MPG was increased to 35 mpg‑US (6.7 L/100 km; 42 mpg‑imp). Subaru claimed a range of 17 miles (27 km) for all-electric driving.
For 2020, the Crosstrek received Subaru's SI-Drive powertrain management system, first available on the Subaru Forester and Subaru WRX models with a CVT. An auto start-stop system was added, along with an optional 6-way power driver's seat being added to the Premium trim. All models had USB and AUX ports moved from the center console to the console storage tray, which received lighting on the Premium and Limited trim. The Limited and Hybrid trims got rear seat USB ports. New is an automatic door locking and unlocking system with automatic unlocking in a collision. The Eyesight system now features lane centering.


=== Crosstrek Hybrid ===
In May 2018, Subaru of America announced a plug-in hybrid electric version for the 2019 model year to serve as a compliance car, and thus is sold only in states that follow California emission standards. It has three different modes: full-electric (traction motor drawing from battery power), parallel hybrid (traction motor assisting gasoline engine), or series hybrid (motor-generator unit driven from gasoline engine). The Crosstrek Hybrid features the FB20 gasoline engine detuned to 137 hp (139 PS; 102 kW), coupled with two electric motors developing a combined 148 hp (150 PS; 110 kW). The car has a fuel tank of 13.2 US gallons (50 L; 11.0 imp gal) and an 8.8 kWh (32 MJ) battery, which together enable a range of 480 miles (770 km). The two electric motors have separate functions: Motor Generator One is the starter and acts as a generator under regenerative braking; Motor Generator Two is the traction motor with an output of 118 hp (120 PS; 88 kW) and 149 lb⋅ft (202 N⋅m; 21 kg⋅m); together, the two motors and battery pack add approximately 455 pounds (206 kg) to the curb weight of the car. Under electric power only, the Crosstrek Hybrid can achieve a 17 miles (27 km) of range at speeds up to 65 mph (105 km/h).


=== XV e-BOXER ===
Subaru introduced the e-BOXER hybrid powertrain for the European-market Forester and XV at Geneva in March 2019; the e-BOXER integrates an electric motor into the Lineartronic continuously-variable transmission to improve fuel economy and increase power. The battery for the traction motor is placed above the rear axle, improving the front/rear weight balance. The e-BOXER powertrain features a modified FB20 rated at 110 kW (148 hp; 150 PS), but compared to the US-market Crosstrek Hybrid, the XV e-BOXER uses a single electric motor rated at 12.3 kW (16 hp; 17 PS) maximum output.


=== Facelift ===

Starting summer of 2020, for the 2021 model year, Subaru began selling the Crosstrek with changes that include aesthetic tweaks, a new trim level, more driver assistance technology, and a new 2.5-liter engine option. The most obvious exterior styling change is larger front lower bumper cladding in black plastic. The new Sport trim level, above Premium and below the top spec Limited, will bring with it Subaru's dual X-Mode traction control with Snow/Dirt and Deep Snow/Mud terrain options. On the Canadian market, the Sport is known as the Outdoor. The Sport trim will also get a unique interior with a Sport logo plus yellow stitching. Limited trim vehicles will get a leather interior with orange stitching. For driver aids, any CVT-equipped Crosstrek can get adaptive cruise control and lane centering. Top-of-the-line Limited models will receive blind-spot detection with lane-change assist plus cross-traffic alert, reverse automated emergency braking, and high-beam assist. For the first time, the Crosstrek offers a 2.5-liter FB25D as an engine option, and it is only available with the CVT transmission on the Sport and Limited trim levels. The new engine offering makes 182 hp (185 PS; 136 kW), 30 more than the standard 2.0L engine.
For the 2023 model year, a new Special Edition package was introduced for the Premium trim, marking the return of the Desert Khaki color option offered in the previous generation. It is fitted with a custom black and red interior with red stitching and leather accents. As with the previous generation, the Special Edition was limited to 1,000 units, and all models were only available with the CVT transmission.

== Third generation (GU; 2022) ==

The third generation Crosstrek was revealed in Japan on September 15, 2022, while being based on the outgoing model. It went on sale in Japan in December 2022, being available with a cheaper front-wheel drive option. Also, the third generation Crosstrek marks the end of any market using the XV nameplate.
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== North America ===
The third generation Crosstrek for the North American market debuted at the Chicago Auto Show on February 9, 2023. The 2.0-liter FB20D and 2.5-liter FB25D engines were carried over from the previous generation, and the manual transmission was discontinued. For the first time, the 2.5-liter Crosstrek Sport and Limited are produced in the United States at Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. in Lafayette, Indiana. Production for the 2.5-liter models began on May 17, 2023. The 2.0-liter Base and Premium trims continued to be produced in Japan. The 2.5-liter Onyx and Limited trim levels for the Canadian market are sourced from Japan. With the exception of the Wilderness trim, Crosstrek models produced in the United States are not exported to Canada.
For the 2025 model year, the 2.5-liter engine became standard for the Premium trim, replacing the 2.0-liter engine. Additionally, it received the dual-function X-MODE that was previously only available on the Sport, Limited, and Wilderness trims. While the Sport, Limited, and Wilderness trim levels equipped with the 2.5-liter engine are still produced in the United States, the Premium trim equipped with the 2.5-liter engine will continue to be produced in Japan alongside the Base trim, which remains unchanged from the previous year.


==== Crosstrek Wilderness ====
On April 5, 2023, Subaru revealed the Crosstrek Wilderness at the New York Auto Show. It is a more off-road-oriented version of the Crosstrek, and the third vehicle to be launched under Subaru's "Wilderness" brand. The suspension is raised to 9.3 inches (240 mm), which is 0.6 inches (15 mm) more than the standard Crosstrek's 8.7 inches (220 mm) of ground clearance. The roof rack is rated for 700 pounds (320 kg).  The Crosstrek Wilderness uses the same 2.5-liter FB25D from the Sport and Limited trims and features a lower final drive ratio of 4.11 compared to the standard 3.7. The CVT transmission was retuned for better low-speed performance, and with the addition of a CVT cooler, it can tow up to 3,500 pounds (1,600 kg). Like the other 2.5-liter trims, the Wilderness is also produced in the United States at SIA.


=== Southeast Asia ===
The third generation Crosstrek debuted in Indonesia at the Gaikindo Jakarta Auto Week on March 10, 2023.
On July 12, 2023, Subaru's Philippine distributor Motor Image Pilipinas officially launched the third generation Crosstrek with two trims: 2.0i-L and 2.0i-S, equipped with Subaru's EyeSight 4.0.
The third generation Crosstrek debuted in Vietnam at the Vietnam Motor Show on October 23, 2024 with two variants. It is powered by either a 2.0-liter gasoline or a 2.0-liter gasoline hybrid.


=== Safety ===


== Awards ==
Motor Trend ranked the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek #1 Subcompact SUV.
Consumer Reports ranked the 2022 Subaru Crosstrek #1 Subcompact SUV.
U.S. News & World Report ranked the Subaru Crosstrek at No. 6 on its list of Best Subcompact SUVs for 2022, giving it a score of 7.9 out of 10.


== Issues ==


=== North America ===
Many North American journalists and owners believe the Crosstrek is underpowered, like most cars in its class, and advocate for a turbocharged model, akin to the Subaru Impreza Gravel Express. This has partially been resolved with the MY2021 facelift since the Outdoor (Canada), Sport (US), and Limited trims now include a more powerful engine that brings its power closer to other compact crossover SUVs in the North American market and the competing Mazda CX-30 (non-turbocharged models).
MY2013–2018 Crosstreks with the CVT have had their transmission warranties extended to 10 years and 100,000 miles (and one year after their warranties were extended, that being 2018 for MY13-15 vehicles and 2019 for MY16-18 vehicles, regardless of age or mileage), with Subaru saying there were no complaints or conditions behind the extensions.
All MY2013 Crosstreks were given an extended engine warranty (8 years/100,000 miles, or one year from the warranty extension being published, regardless of age or mileage) due to excessive oil consumption after a class action lawsuit, with MY2014 and MY2015 models only being recalled with the manual transmission. All first generation Crosstreks were recalled for faulty brake light switches which Subaru stated was discovered themselves, with 33 reports on all affected models (including 2008–2016 Subaru Imprezas and 2014–2016 Subaru Foresters) in the US.
83,499 2018 Crosstreks and 37 2019 Crosstrek plug-In hybrids, along with 2017–2018 Subaru Imprezas and 2019 Subaru Forester and Ascent models were recalled for a faulty PCV valve that could break apart and cause oil consumption or possibly a stall.
In July 2021, a warranty extension for up to 10 years (and unlimited mileage) was applied to the electronic power steering rack of all 1st generation US Crosstreks (along with all 4th generation Foresters and Imprezas) due to the possibility of corrosion in areas with high amounts of road salt deployed in winter months (like the Rust Belt region of the United States) causing the rack to become prone to cracking after a significant impact. The issue doesn't cause complete failure of the rack, however it does cause issues with steering feel when turning. Owners who receive a repair will get an updated steering rack that is not prone to this issue.
In October 2021, a warranty extension for up to 8 years (and unlimited mileage) was applied to all first generation Crosstreks (along with most Subaru models of the time period) for the CVT parking brake switch, as when the contacts on the switch are contaminated, owners can't remove their key from their ignition switch. All affected vehicles, regardless or age or mileage, are covered by this extension until October 31, 2022.


== Sales ==
Sales in the United States have been much stronger than its predecessor, the Outback Sport, with 2019 being the first year with a sales drop, which could be attributed to a car sales slump in the US.
