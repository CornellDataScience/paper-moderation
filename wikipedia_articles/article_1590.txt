Druid were a 1970s progressive rock band from England, and initially came to public attention by winning the Melody Maker Rock and Folk talent contest in 1974. The band went on to perform on to record two albums signed to EMI - Toward the Sun (1975) and Fluid Druid (1976). The band performed 'Voices' and 'Theme', from Toward the Sun on The Old Grey Whistle Test, broadcast on 7th October 1975. Their sound was notably influenced by Yes and Genesis.
Following the demise of Druid in 1977, aborting the recording of their third record Newfoundland, Neil Brewer and Dane Stevens formed The Never Never Band with a more post-punk sound. The band ultimately split up in 1981 into two short lived groups - The Vetos, and Splash.
Former member Cedric Sharpley, who went on to back Gary Numan in the Dramatis and Tubeway Army, died from a heart attack on 13 March 2012. Keyboard player Andrew McCrorie-Shand later pursued a career composing for Ragdoll Productions, most notably their longest-running TV shows Rosie and Jim, while bass player Neil Brewer was the show's third and final presenter from 1997 to 2000.
