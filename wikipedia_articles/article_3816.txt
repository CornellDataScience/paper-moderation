== Reception ==
Iyanla, Fix My Life debuted to largely positive reviews by critics. As writer and columnist Nancy Colasurdo proclaimed, Fix My Life is "what "reality" television can be. It’s what it should be. Reaching for our best selves. Focusing on what can make our lives meaningful. Learning from others’ mistakes because they are so often our own. Having hard conversations." Colasurdo further recognizes Vanzant's gutsy, honest approach to handling difficult situations.
Critic Jon Caramanica proposes that Vanzant possesses "a mystical air but with a deeply grounded approach. She speaks in a soothing, encouraging voice, makes phenomenal eye contact and has an evident distaste for polish. Iyanla: Fix My Life is Intervention and daytime talk distilled to core principles. Much of the show is given over to long, hard conversations, shot up close, a tactic of discomfort." He goes on to critique that "her truth-teller presentation can go overboard at times: In a later episode, she literally ties family members together with string to illustrate how bonds work, then uses scissors to emphasize a point about abandonment. But mostly, it’s bracing watching her poke holes in the delusions of her charges."
