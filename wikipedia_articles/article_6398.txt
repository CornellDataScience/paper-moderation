== Professional career ==


=== New York Mets ===
Lindstrom was selected by the New York Mets in the 10th round of the 2002 MLB draft. He made his professional debut at Rookie League Kingsport and posted an 0–6 record with a 4.84 ERA in twelve games with eleven games as a starting pitcher. He began next year at Single-A Capital City and was dominant, as his 2.86 ERA and 7.94 K/9 rate showed. This earned him a promotion to Brooklyn where Lindstrom would finish out the 2003 season well, as he compiled a 7–3 record with a 3.44 ERA.
In 2004, Lindstrom was promoted to St. Lucie where, at 24, he compiled a 5–5 record with a 3.73 ERA in fourteen starts. His walk rate was staggering, however, at 2.26 BB/9. The righty found himself back at Capital City midway through the season, where his numbers improved slightly, as he posted a 3–2 record with a 3.21 ERA and much-improved control, with a 1.61 BB/9.
At age 25, Lindstrom began the 2005 season at Double-A Binghamton, in what was determined to be a make-or-break year for his career. Lindstrom went 2–5 with an ERA of 5.40 with eye-popping walk and home run rates of 6.75 BB/9 and 1.35 HR/9 in thirty-five games (ten starts, as the troubled righty was switched to bullpen duty midway through the season).


=== Florida Marlins ===

On November 20, 2006, Lindstrom and Henry Owens were traded to the Florida Marlins in exchange for Jason Vargas and Adam Bostick. Both Lindstrom and Owens were highly regarded as a top closer candidates for the 2007 season. Lindstrom's fastball often touches 100 mph and averages in the high 90's. Playing in the Puerto Rican Winter League in the 06-07 offseason, his fastball was clocked at 102 mph.
On May 17, 2007, while pitching in the 8th inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park, Lindstrom's fastball was clocked at 102 mph on the stadium scoreboard.
Lindstrom picked up his first MLB win against the Brewers in Milwaukee on June 2, 2007.
In the final game of the 2008 regular season, Lindstrom earned a save versus the New York Mets. He threw the final pitch during actual game-play of Shea Stadium (Tom Seaver would throw a "final pitch" during the post-game activities).


=== Houston Astros ===
On December 9, 2009, Lindstrom was dealt to the Houston Astros for minor leaguers Robert Bono, Luis Bryan and a player to be named later, which became Rule 5 draft pick Jorge Jimenez, a third baseman selected from the Red Sox organization.
