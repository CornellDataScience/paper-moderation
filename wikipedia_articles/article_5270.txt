== College career ==


=== Freshman season ===
Lewis chose to wear number 331 at Maryland and was selected as a starter by coach Lefty Driesell since his freshman year. He was considered one of the best defensive freshmen in the country due to his shot blocking ability and dunking. After coming off the bench for the first three games of the season, Driesell made him the starting center of the team: he was only the second freshman to start as a center during Driesell's stint as a coach at Maryland. On November 21, 1984, in a Great Alaska Shootout game against Tennessee, Lewis recorded a career-high 10 blocks; he tied the mark later in the season, posting another 10-block game against Towson State on January 21, 1985. On February 24 he posted a career-high 14 rebounds against Wake Forest. In the quarterfinals of the 1985 ACC men's basketball tournament against Duke, Lewis scored a new career high of 16 points.
During his freshman season Lewis started 34 of 37 games, averaging 6 points, 6.5 rebounds, 0.9 assists and 2.7 blocks per game in 30.1 minutes of playing time. He recorded 99 blocks for the season, which at the time was the single-season all-time high at Maryland. His 241 rebounds made him the 7th best rebounder in the conference. He was named ACC Rookie of the Week twice during the season, and finished second in the ACC Rookie of the Year award voting behind Duane Ferrell of Georgia Tech.


=== Sophomore season ===
Lewis was confirmed as a starter for his sophomore year, and was the only player on the roster to start all 33 games. He scored double figures in 13 games; he tied his career-high of 16 points twice in the season, against Ohio State and Georgia Tech. He also posted a season-high 12 rebounds twice, against Duke and Clemson. His season high in blocks was 7 against North Carolina on February 20, 1986.
During the 1986 NCAA tournament, Lewis recorded a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds against Pepperdine, and scored 5 points (with 4 blocks) in the loss against UNLV. During the tournament, Lewis played as a power forward, as the center was Terry Long. He recorded 71 season blocks, and led the team in steals per game with 1.1.


=== Junior season ===
As a junior, Lewis gained an increased scoring load after the departure of Len Bias, who had left the team for the 1986 NBA draft. He was again named the starting center, and the team captain. On January 28, 1987, Lewis recorded a triple double against James Madison with 29 points (a new career high), 23 rebounds (career high) and 12 blocks (another career high, and the best single-game mark in Maryland history). On February 18 he recorded his second triple double (the only player to record more than one in Terrapins history) with 32 points (his career high), 10 rebounds and 10 blocks against UMBC. On February 27 he recorded 10 blocks against Maryland Eastern Shore.
Lewis was the second best scorer in the ACC with 19.6 points per game behind Horace Grant of Clemson (21.0), and was the second best rebounder in the conference with 9.5 per game (again behind Grant who had 9.6). He led his team in scoring, rebounding, blocks, steals and field goal percentage. He recorded 114 total blocks in the season, improving his own record established in his freshman season. He led the ACC in blocks with a 4.4 average, which also ranked him 2nd in the whole NCAA Division I behind David Robinson's 4.5. His 35.8 minutes per game in the season are the 8th best mark in the history of the Terrapins. He earned a selection as the ACC Player of the Week, and at the end of the season he was named in the All-ACC First Team with 182 votes (4th overall in votes behind Horace Grant, Kenny Smith and Joe Wolf), and was selected as an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press. He also finished third in ACC Player of the Year voting with 7 votes, behind Kenny Smith and Horace Grant. He was also among the 10 finalists for the Adolph Rupp Trophy, and received 2 votes.


=== Senior season ===
Lewis was considered one of the college basketball top defensive players when he returned to Maryland for his senior season; Sporting News ranked him the third-best power forward in college basketball behind Danny Manning and J. R. Reid, and included him in the preseason All-American watchlist. He played mostly in the power forward position as a senior, with the center position assigned to Brian Williams and Tony Massenburg. Lewis was named ACC Player of the Week once during the season, starting all 31 games and playing 34.8 minutes per game, the 10th best single-season mark of all time at Maryland. He recorded 55 blocks in the season, reaching a career total of 339. He led his team in points, rebounds, steals and blocks, and ranked third in assists; he also shot 45.5% from three. He ranked 4th in the ACC in rebounding with 7.6 per game. At the end of the season he was selected in the All-ACC Second Team with 69 votes.
Lewis ended his career at Maryland with 1,458 points, 948 rebounds and 339 blocks. As of 2020, he ranks 19th all-time in points, third in rebounds and first in blocks. He also ranks second in career blocks per game average (2.7) behind Joe Smith (3.0). He posted 23 double doubles in his career, and he is the only player in Maryland history with 2 triple doubles.

In May he was invited to the US national team trials to be part of the squad for the 1988 Summer Olympics; he did not make the team.
