Hebert was among the greatest quarterbacks in the USFL's short history. In 1983, he won the USFL championship with the Michigan Panthers, defeating the Philadelphia Stars, 24–22. The team struggled a bit with injuries in 1984 and a weakened squad was knocked out of the playoffs by Steve Young's Los Angeles Express 27–21 in triple OT.  In 1985, the Panthers were merged with the Oakland Invaders and Hebert again led his team to the finals against the Stars. This time Hebert's team fell short and the Stars won 28–24. In three years in the USFL, Hebert completed 773 of 1,407 passes for 13,137 passing yards. He is the USFL's all-time leader in passing yardage.
USFLOnline.com: Hebert remembers when the Panthers were the “Talk-of-the-Town” in the city of Detroit. “We were a lot more popular than the Lions were,” he says. “We won the USFL Championship after Detroit not having a champion since the Bobby Layne days in the 1950s.”
Hebert, with a confident tone in his voice, says, “I think we would have been in the top 14 of the NFL if we [Panthers] played them. We didn't have the depth as the NFL, but we had a good chance to win because the guys that started on the Panthers also started in the NFL later on.”
