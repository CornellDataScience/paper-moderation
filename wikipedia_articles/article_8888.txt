Vladimir Vladimirovich Malanin (born August 30, 1942, Sylvensk, Kungursky District, USSR) is a Russian mathematician.
Rector, vice-rector and president of Perm University. Head of the Department of Control Processes and Information Security of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Perm University. Confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the presidential elections (2000, 2004, 2012).


== Biography ==
From 1960 to 1965, he was studying at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Perm University. As one of the best students of Perm University, in the fifth year he had an opportunity to study and internship at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of the Moscow State University.
His dissertation was titled "Some questions of the study of the process of launching an aircraft to a given program". His scientific supervisor was I. F. Vereshchagin. Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (1970, professor (1991), Doctor of Technical Sciences (2001).
From November 1975 to the end of 2011, he was the Head of the Department of Mechanics and Control Processes (since 2006 — the Department of Control Processes and Information Security) of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Perm University.
From 1983 to 1987, he was a vice-rector for scientific work at Perm University. In March 1987, Malanin was appointed the rector by the decision of the University staff. It was one of the first times in the USSR and the first in the RSFSR when the head of the university in this way. Then he was re-elected to this position four times (in 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007). On January 15, 2010, he was dismissed from the post of rector at his own will. He was elected a President of Perm University. From 2010, he was a member of many scientific and educational Councils, Centers and Associations.
Confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the presidential elections (2000, 2004, 2012). Chairman of the Public Council of Perm Krai Police Department (2010–2013), member of Perm Krai Public Chamber (2010–2015).
He can speak fluently English and French.


== Scientific activities ==
His research interests are also related to such topics as Computer algebra, Mathematical Modeling in natural sciences, General and Applied Mechanics, methods of Optimization and History of Physical and Mathematical sciences.
The longest term direction of scientific research is the solution of problems of optimal flight control of aircraft. He has been developing methods of solid mechanics that use the Rodrigue–Hamilton and Cayley–Klein parameters to describe motion.
Since 1975, under the leadership of V. V. Malanin, there have been scientific seminars on dynamical systems at the Department of Mechanics of Perm University. He had scientific internships in 1976 and 1977 at the Sorbonne (France) and in 1999 at Oxford (Great Britain).
Under the leadership of V. V. Malanin, there were international and regional conferences, symposiums and seminars in Perm University and other educational and scientific institutions of the Perm Krai. He is the head of research works on grants from CDRF (American Foundation for Civil Research and Development, 2002–2008) and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (since 2002).
He was a scientific consultant of two doctoral dissertations (I. Poloskov, 2004; O. Pensky, 2007). Since 2010, he has been the Chairman of the Doctoral Dissertation Council of Perm University for Physical and Mathematical Sciences and of Perm Regional Branch of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research.
He is the author and co-author of more than 440 publications in various fields of science. 139 of them were published in the closed press, 5 scientific manuals for universities, 10 monographs, 5 certificates of official registration of computer programs, 4 certificates of official registration of Database Management Systems, 16 patents and certificates of state registration.
Since 2010, he is a member of the National Committee for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics of the Russian Academy of Sciences (2002), the Deputy Chairman of the Scientific and Methodological Council for Theoretical Mechanics of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation.
