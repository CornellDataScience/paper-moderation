Holborn and St Pancras () is a parliamentary constituency in Greater London that was created in 1983. It has been represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom since 2015 by Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister since 2024 and Leader of the Labour Party since 2020.


== Constituency profile ==
The seat of Holborn and St Pancras as drawn in 2010 is composed of all but a small western portion of the London Borough of Camden and extends from most of Covent Garden and Bloomsbury in the heart of the West End of London through other areas of the NW1 postal district, north, and in elevation terms upwards through fashionable and economically diverse Camden Town to the affluent suburb of Highgate in a long strip.  Gospel Oak, particularly towards Kentish Town, has high deprivation levels, but the neighbouring Highgate ward has low deprivation levels.
The southern part of the seat includes the University of London and several teaching hospitals, so the constituency has a large student population.
King's Cross, St Pancras International, and Euston railway termini are in the seat.
During the 20th century, the Bloomsbury, Holborn, Covent Garden, and Highgate wards overwhelmingly elected Conservative councillors. Since 2000, the wards forming the seat in its three revised forms have all swung against the Conservative Party. The 2014 local government elections (for a standard four-year term) produced one Green Party councillor for the Highgate ward; the remaining 32 councillors whose wards fall within the seat (as redrawn in 2010) are members of the Labour Party.


=== Political history ===
Labour Party MPs have served this constituency since its creation in 1983. The majorities achieved have been varied, from a relatively marginal 13.9% in 2005 (making it within the lowest 150 seats for the party in that year by percentage of majority) to a landslide 51.7% in 2017. The 2015 result ranked the seat as the 77th safest of the party's 232 seats (by percentage majority). Its predecessor seats have been in Labour hands for all but one term since 1945, and without interruption since 1964.

=== Historic ===
The seat was created in 1983 as a primary successor to Holborn and St Pancras South, which was created in 1950. The seat covers the southern half of the London Borough of Camden, including all or most of Camden Town, King's Cross, Gospel Oak, Kentish Town and Bloomsbury.
The constituency has contained the following wards of the London Borough of Camden:

1983–1997
Bloomsbury, Brunswick, Camden, Castlehaven, Caversham, Chalk Farm, Gospel Oak, Grafton, Holborn, King's Cross, Regent's Park, St John's, St Pancras, and Somers Town.

1997–2010
As above, less Gospel Oak

2010–2024
Bloomsbury, Camden Town with Primrose Hill, Cantelowes, Gospel Oak, Haverstock, Highgate, Holborn and Covent Garden, Kentish Town, King's Cross, Regent's Park, and St Pancras and Somers Town. (Wards renamed and redrawn before 2010 election.)
The Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies by the Boundary Commission for England was implemented nationally in 2010. Parts of Highgate, Gospel Oak, Haverstock, and Camden Town with Primrose Hill wards were transferred from the former constituency of Hampstead and Highgate. The electorate of the new seat would have been 85,188 if it had existed in that form at the 2005 general election. The electorate has since risen further, and at the 2010 general election it had among the five largest electorates in London.


=== Current ===
Further to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which came into effect for the 2024 general election, the constituency is composed of the following London Borough of Camden wards:

Bloomsbury; Camden Square; Camden Town; Haverstock; Holborn and Covent Garden; Kentish Town North; Kentish Town South; King's Cross; Primrose Hill (part); Regent's Park; St. Pancras and Somers Town.
The contents reflect the local government boundary review for Camden which came into effect in May 2022. In order to bring the electorate within the permitted electoral range, the Highgate and Gospel Oak wards were transferred to the re-established constituency of Hampstead and Highgate.


== Members of Parliament ==

The seat was held from 1983 to 2015 by Frank Dobson of the Labour Party, who had been elected in 1979 to the predecessor seat of Holborn & St Pancras South. Dobson was the longest-serving Labour MP in London until he stood down in 2015. The constituency has been represented by Keir Starmer since the 2015 general election. Starmer has served as Leader of the Labour Party (consequently Leader of the Opposition until his 2024 election victory) since April 2020 and the Prime Minister since July 2024.
