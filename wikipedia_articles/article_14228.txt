The New Zealand women's national football team (recognised as Aotearoa New Zealand by FIFA) is governed by New Zealand Football (NZF). They are nicknamed the Football Ferns.
The New Zealand national team has taken part in the FIFA Women's World Cup six times, making their debut in 1991. New Zealand co-hosted the 2023 World Cup alongside Australia. They have failed to go past the group stage in all occasions.


== History ==
The New Zealand Women's Soccer Association was founded in 1975. By invitation, the team took part in the Asian Women's Championship in 1975 and won the championship. They have since then played in the Oceanic Championship.
As Australia left the OFC, New Zealand had no serious and competitive rivals in Oceania. This made New Zealand's qualification to the World Cup and Olympics easier having contested every edition of both tournaments since 2007.


=== 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup ===
New Zealand co-hosted the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup along with Australia after being awarded it on 25 June 2020 as the favourites over other bidder Colombia. The Football Ferns automatically qualified as co-host. Despite winning their opening match against Norway, their first World Cup win for either a women's or men's World Cup, they suffered a shocking loss to debutants Philippines and later drew to Switzerland in their final match, and were eliminated after Norway defeated Philippines and finished above New Zealand on goal difference. This was the first time the hosts were eliminated from the group stage. They only managed to score one goal during the tournament.


== Team image ==
The New Zealand women's national football team are also known by their nickname the "Football Ferns". Like their male counterparts, the team has traditionally worn all white kits. For the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, the Football Ferns switched to an all black first choice kit reminiscent of the New Zealand national rugby union team, as well as the country's national teams in other sports, including rugby league, field hockey, netball, basketball, volleyball, and limited overs cricket. The away kit pairs the traditional white shirts and socks with turquoise shorts.
