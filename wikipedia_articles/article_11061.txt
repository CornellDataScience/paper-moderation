DC Multiverse is an American action figure toyline from Mattel, later by McFarlane Toys. Primarily consisting of 6-inch figures during Mattel's run and 7-inch figures during McFarlane Toys production, the line is based on properties owned by DC Comics. The line was launched as a continuation of Mattel's DC Universe Classics line and utilizes the same scale, sculpt and articulation style. Under McFarlane Toys, the scale was upped to 7-inches with 22 points of articulation.


== History ==
After DC Universe Classics ceased production in 2014, Mattel unveiled figures from the successor line, DC Multiverse, at San-Diego Comic-Con 2015. Unlike the previous line, which primarily focused on comic iterations of the character, it was announced that Multiverse would mix classic comic designs with other media based on DC's characters, such as their films, TV shows and video games. Like DC Universe Classics, DC Multiverse also uses the Collect and Connect concept, where each figure in a wave comes packaged with a piece needed to complete an extra bonus figure or role play item.
In 2019, it was announced that Mattel had lost the DC license, and that the DC Multiverse brand would be taken over by McFarlane Toys beginning in 2020.
