Stephen Bourne (born 31 October 1957) is a British writer, film and social historian specialising in Black heritage and gay culture. 


== Career ==
He was a research officer at the British Film Institute on a project that documented the history of Black people in British television. He wrote Brief Encounters: Lesbians and Gays in British Cinema 1930–71 published in 1996. His book Black in the British Frame: Black People in British Film and Television 1896-1996 was published in 1998. His Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television followed on it in 2001. He also wrote books on American actors Elisabeth Welch, Ethel Waters, Butterfly McQueen, and Nina Mae McKinney. He co-authored a pair of books with Esther Bruce about her life as a seamstress in London.

 In 2014, Bourne's book Black Poppies: Britain's Black Community and the Great War was published by The History Press. Reviewing it in The Independent, Bernardine Evaristo said: "Until historians and cultural map-makers stop ignoring the historical presence of people of colour, books such as this one provide a powerful, revelatory counterbalance to the whitewashing of British history."
Following the publication of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities in March 2021, Bourne revealed he was listed as a contributor to the report without his knowledge, stating that he felt manipulated.
His book Deep Are the Roots: Trailblazers Who Changed Black British Theatre was published in 2021 and his book Amanda Ira Aldridge and Avril Coleridge-Taylor: Getting the Tempo Right (about British composers Amanda Ira Aldridge and Avril Coleridge-Taylor) in 2024.
