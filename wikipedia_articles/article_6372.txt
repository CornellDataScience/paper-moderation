Aditya Dubey is an Indian environmental activist. He is a recipient of the Diana Award in 2021. In August 2020, Dubey filed a petition with the Supreme Court of India, requesting the apex court to help farmers with free stubble-removing machines that could result in reduction in stubble burning which is considered a major cause of air pollution in Delhi. He also reached out to the Chief Ministers of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, seeking end to fines or police actions for stubble burning.
The plea was addressed by the Supreme Court and a three judge bench formed a committee led by judge Madan B Lokur to monitor the situation. An ordinance â€˜Commission For Management Of Air Quality in Delhi & Adjoining Areas, 2020 was eventually promulgated to handle the air pollution problem in Delhi and nearby areas. Dubey was also part of the 'No Car Sunday' initiative in Delhi that promoted giving up use of personal vehicles for a day.
