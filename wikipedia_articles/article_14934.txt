American recording artist Mya has appeared in fifty-five music videos; thirty-four as a lead artist, twelve as a featured artist and nine as a guest or cameo appearance. With her videogenic charm, right from beginning MTV embraced Mya and her music videos. Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters noted in the singer's early videos: she wore modest costumes and looked polite, even demure.
In 1998, Mya released her debut single, "It's All About Me" from her eponymous debut album. A commercial success, the song's accompanying music video garnered her Billboard Video Music Award nomination for Best New R&B/Urban clip. Other music videos from the album included for the singles were "Movin' On" and "My First Night with You" in 1998 and 1999. The former, in retrospect by Complex magazine was touted as one of the Best R&B Videos of the 90s.  While the latter featured guest appearances from actors Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs and Kathleen Bradley portraying Mya's parents. Rapper Saafir appeared as her love interest. "Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)," a collaborative effort with rappers Pras and Ol' Dirty Bastard garnered two MTV Video Music Award nominations for Best Rap Video and Best Video from a Film.
In 2000, she released her sophomore album, Fear of Flying. It featured the singles; "The Best of Me," "Case of the Ex," and "Free." The music videos for "Case of the Ex" and "Free" won Best Choreography for Hip-hop music video at 2001 American Choreography Awards. The former has received relentless praise for its choreography. Aspects of the video have been emulated by singer Ciara for her music video "Got Me Good." "Lady Marmalade," her 2001 collaborative effort with Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, and Pink won the prestigious Video of the Year award at 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. Following a brief music hiatus, Mya returned in 2003 with her third studio album, Moodring. It spawned the singles, "My Love Is Like...Wo" and "Fallen." Directed by Paul Hunter and under Mya's creative vision, "My Love Is Like...Wo" received two nominations at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Dance Video and Best Choreography in a video. For her solo performance in the "Love Lies" music video, singer Normani cited "My Love Is Like...Wo" music video as inspiration.
