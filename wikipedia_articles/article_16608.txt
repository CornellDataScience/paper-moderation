The 2020 Sakhir Formula 2 round was a pair of motor races for Formula 2 cars that took place on 28-29 November 2020 at the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain as part of the FIA Formula 2 Championship.

== Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ==

The races was originally due to take place on 21-22 March 2020 as the opening round of the championship, but the COVID-19 pandemic led to event organisers initially announcing that no spectators would be permitted to attend the race. On 13 March 2020 the race was indefinitely postponed. It was the second time in Formula Two, then called GP2, history that the Bahrain Grand Prix was postponed after the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, which was ultimately cancelled. In its place, an online virtual Grand Prix was held on the original race date featuring racing drivers, celebrities, and e-sport racers. The virtual race was won by  Guanyu Zhou. In August, the Bahrain Grand Prix was rescheduled to 29 November. Due to a surge of COVID-19 cases in the country, organisers announced that the Grand Prix would take place behind closed doors. Local authorities gave special dispensation to allow local health workers to attend with their families.
