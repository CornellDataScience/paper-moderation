Croatia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 with the song "Vjerujem u ljubav" written by Dado Topić. The song was performed by the band Dragonfly featuring Dado Topić. The Croatian broadcaster Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) organised the national final Dora 2007 to select the Croatian entry for the 2007 contest in Helsinki, Finland. Thirty-two entries competed in the national final which consisted of three shows: two semi-finals and a final. Eight entries qualified from each semi-final on 1 and 2 March 2007 to compete in the final on 3 March 2007. In the final, "Vjerujem u ljubav" performed by Dragonfly featuring Dado Topić was selected as the winner following the combination of votes from a five-member jury panel and a public televote.
Croatia competed in the semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 10 May 2007. Performing during the show in position 13, "Vjerujem u ljubav" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. This marked the first time that Croatia failed to qualify to the final of the Eurovision Song Contest from a semi-final since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004. It was later revealed that Croatia placed sixteenth out of the 28 participating countries in the semi-final with 54 points.


== Background ==

Prior to the 2007 contest, Croatia had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest fourteen times since its first entry in 1993. The nation's best result in the contest was fourth, which it achieved on two occasions: in 1996 with the song "Sveta ljubav" performed by Maja Blagdan and in 1999 with the song "Marija Magdalena" performed by Doris Dragović. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the 2004, Croatia had featured in every final they participated in thus far. In 2006, Croatia was an automatic finalist with Severina and the song "Moja štikla".
The Croatian national broadcaster, Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT), broadcasts the event within Croatia and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. HRT confirmed Croatia's participation in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest on 31 October 2006. Since 1993, HRT organised the national final Dora in order to select the Croatian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, a method that was continued for their 2007 participation.
