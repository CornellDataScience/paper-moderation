Lorenzo Aragón Armenteros (born April 28, 1974) is a former amateur boxer from Cuba, who was a two-time world champion in the welterweight category.


== Amateur career ==
Aragón took up boxing at the age of 12. In 1991, a 17-year-old Aragón won a bronze medal in Playa Girón, Cuba's national amateur boxing tournament. Aragón became the youngest boxer to ever medal in that competition. In 1992, Aragón would go on to win the tournament and win the flyweight gold medal in the 1992 AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships. He competed at the 1996 Olympics as a featherweight, losing in the quarterfinals to Floyd Mayweather. Aragón got a flash knockdown over Mayweather but he'd lose by a single point.
Between 1992 and 2004, Aragón won the Playa Girón tournament 10 times across 6 different weight classes, defeating boxers like Mario Kindelan, Arnaldo Mesa, and Erislandy Lara. Aragón would eventually settle in the welterweight division, where he won several international competitions.
Aragón won the 2001 World Championships at welterweight, beating Anthony Thompson in the final.  He repeated his win in 2003 defeating Andre Berto in the semifinals and Sherzod Husanov in the final bout. Aragón was also the 2003 Pan American Games champion in the same division.
At the 2004 Summer Olympics he won a silver medal. He beat Vanes Martirosyan in the semifinals. In the final, Aragón was upset by surprise winner Bakhtiyar Artayev with a score of 36-26. Before the Athens Games, he won the 2004 Acropolis Boxing Cup in Athens, Greece by defeating Ruslan Khairov in the final of the welterweight division.
