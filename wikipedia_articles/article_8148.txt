Melinting  is one of the traditional Lampungese dances originating from the Lampung province, Indonesia. The Melinting dance was originally called the Cetik Kipas dance. The name was later replaced with the Melinting dance which refers to the origin of this dance, namely the Melinting area. The name change was at the suggestion of President Sukarno who asked the Central Lampung Regional Government to perform the dance at Istora Senayan Jakarta on August 17, 1965. Melinting is a dance inherited from Ratu Melinting which is estimated to have existed in the sixteenth century. This dance is performed at traditional events when welcoming guests, and the dancers are members of the Queen's family or Melinting nobles. This dance was danced outside a traditional event for the first time in 1930 in Teluk Betung at the invitation of the Resident of Lampung to Pesirah Marga in Lampung.

The Melinting dance originates from Lampung, and is thought to have developed since Islam gained a large following in Indonesia. However, this dance is not widely known even from the people of Lampung itself.
This dance is one of the relics of the Melinting Kingdom, which was created by Ratu Melinting II in the 16th century. This dance has the meaning of showing how people are grateful for the happiness they have received. In addition, this dance also illustrates the might and majesty of Ratu Meliting in leading the kingdom at that time. Before undergoing a refinement change in 1958, the Melinting Lampung dance was absolutely owned by the royal family of the Queen Melinting Family.
