== History ==

Bethel Township was the smallest of all the original townships of Chester County. The township is mentioned as early as 1683, and means "House of God".  In 1683, Edward Beazer and Edward Brown had 500 acres surveyed to them in the northeasterly end of the township. On this tract, Bethel hamlet, afterwards known as Corner Catch (Ketch), is the location of the current village of Chelsea. In 1686, the road now known as Bethel Road was laid out from Bethel to Chichester (Marcus Hook).
The settlers of Bethel Township were among the earliest settlers of the Pennsylvania Colony, and many were members of the Religious Society of Friends, or "Quakers". The list of taxables for Bethel township in 1693, shows nine tax payers: John Gibbons, Ralph Pyle, John Bushel, Nicholas Pyle, Edward Beazer, Robert Eyre, Thomas Garrett, John Howard, Thomas Cooper. In 1715, the list had doubled to include: Robert Pyle, John Grist, Robert Booth, Edward Beazer, John Canady, Benjamin Moulder, Joseph Pyle, John Hickman, Edward Griffith, John Hopton, John Gibbons, and Thomas Durnell.  Robert Pyle, a leader of the Society of Friends, was almost continuously a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from 1688 until 1705.
In 1759, residents of Bethel Township paid "a bounty" of ten pounds "in behalf of the township" along with a wagon and supplies of oats and flour to General John Forbes based on his request to Chester and other counties in the province to support an army about to march to Fort Duquesne under his command.
In 1777, after the Battle of Brandywine, the British Army passed through Bethel Township on Old Concord Road as they chased the retreating Continental Army toward Chester and encamped at nearby Birmingham and Aston.  Residents of Bethel were "annoyed and plundered" by the British army and many residents were left entirely without food.

On September 26, 1789, Bethel Township became part of Delaware County as it was established by separating from the eastern portion of Chester County.
The Siloam United Methodist Church in Bethel was founded in 1852 and is the only church in Bethel Township.
Garnet mines were established in Bethel township by Herman Behr & Co. of New York in 1879.  The mine operated until 1912.  The garnet mine gave rise to the regional name of Garnet Valley.

The second floor was designated School No. 4 and used as student population necessitated.  The building was sold on September 2, 1953, to Brigg's Auction.
