== History ==
Silent Poets was formed by Michiharu Shimoda in 1991. Their first meaningful work was the album Potential Meeting released in 1992 on Toy's Factory. After releasing their fifth album To Come..., Haruno left the group and Silent Poets became Shimoda's solo project. After that Shimoda composed music for fashion shows, released a huge number of remixes. The 2005 album, Sun, was released after a six year gap in recordings.
In 2018, Silent Poets released the album dawn, featuring the song "Asylums for the Feeling." The song would be used in Hideo Kojima's game Death Stranding, appearing both in marketing and in the final game. Silent Poets would also compose one of the songs for the end credits. Silent Poets currently composes the music for Kojima's weekly Spotify podcast Hideo Kojima presents Brain Structure.
