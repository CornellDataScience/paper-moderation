Drafted with the third selection in the first AFL Rookie Draft by Melbourne in 1997, Bassett was elevated to the senior list after Round 4 in 1997 to replace Craig Turley but suffered a fractured sternum in the next Reserves game and was unable to make his AFL debut for the Demons. When he made his return to the reserves he played six more games at full forward but didn't see much of the ball and wasn't suited to the role. At the end of the season he was traded to Adelaide for Matthew Collins and Brent Williams.
