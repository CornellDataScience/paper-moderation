"Hot Fun in the Summertime" is a 1969 song recorded by Sly and the Family Stone. The single was released just prior to the band's high-profile performance at Woodstock, which greatly expanded their fanbase. The song peaked at number 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart, kept out of the number 1 spot by "I Can't Get Next to You" by The Temptations. "Hot Fun in the Summertime" also peaked at number 3 on the U.S. Billboard soul singles chart in autumn 1969.  It is ranked as the seventh biggest U.S. hit of 1969, and the 65th in Canada.
Rolling Stone ranked the song #247 on their list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time", and it has also been named in lists by Yahoo! Music and AskMen as an all-time "summer anthem."


== Background ==
Thematically, "Hot Fun in the Summertime" is a dedication to the fun and games to be had during the summer. "Hot Fun in the Summertime" was intended to be included on an in-progress album with "Everybody Is a Star" and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)"; the LP was never completed, and the three tracks were instead included on the band's 1970 Greatest Hits LP.  This song is known for its rare use of strings in a Sly and the Family Stone song, featuring violins being played in the upper register.
The B-side to this single is "Fun," a song taken from the group's third album (Life) from 1968.
