Barry Railway Class A were the first steam tank engines to be built for the Barry Railway in South Wales and had an 0-6-0T wheel arrangement.  They were designed by John Wolfe Barry and built by Sharp Stewart.


== Traffic duties ==
The locomotive was primarily intended for heavy shunting duties at Barry Docks and Nos. 1-4 were delivered to Barry for that purpose. One locomotive, No. 5 was the first to be delivered to Treforest Junction where it hauled the Engineer's Saloon at the northern end of the line; the through line to the docks not yet being completed. To perform this duty, No. 5 was fitted with a vacuum injector and train pipes. Because of this, No. 5 was used to pull the first passenger train between Barry Docks and Cogan when the line opened on 20 December 1888. The following year the Class C locomotives arrived and were specifically designed for passenger traffic, at which point the vacuum brake fittings were removed and No. 5 was sent to work with the other 4 locomotives of the class in the docks. 


== Withdrawal ==
All five locomotives passed to the Great Western Railway in 1922.  No. 1 (GWR 699) was withdrawn in April 1931 and sold to Coltness Iron Co Ltd in June 1932; it was cut up on site in March 1962.  No. 2 (GWR 700) was withdrawn in October 1926 and sold to Guest, Keen Nettlefolds at Dowlais Steelworks in October 1927; it was scrapped in August 1950.  No. 4 (GWR 703) was withdrawn in May 1932 and sold to Ocean Coal Co Ltd at Lady Windsor Colliery in Ynysybwl; it was scrapped in 1956.  No. 3 (GWR 702) was withdrawn in April 1931 and placed on the sales list though never sold.  No. 5 (GWR 706) was withdrawn in November 1930 but not offered for sale.  None has been preserved.
