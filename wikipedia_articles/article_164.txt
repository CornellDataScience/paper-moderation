== Background ==
Dan Smith had a plan for the album prior to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, but the album took on more "prescient" themes as it was primarily worked on during the subsequent lockdowns. Smith said that "what is real and what is not has become pretty difficult to discern sometimes. We're in the age of deep fake, fake news and lying world leaders". The album has been characterised as pairing "tech-heavy themes with glistening, ambitious pop music", as well as "a tribute to humanity in a tech age" that "reflects on the strangeness of living through times that can feel like science fiction".
The album also includes a spoken-word interlude narrated by British actor and rapper Riz Ahmed titled "Promises".
