=== 1942 first U-boat attack ===

On 11 September 1942, while anchored at Carlisle Bay, Bridgetown, Barbados she was fired upon by U-514 with multiple G7e torpedoes at a distance of 2,400 yards (2,200 m). Although the majority of the torpedoes were caught by the harbour's torpedo net, a single torpedo managed to breach the net and hit Cornwallis just abreast of the #2 hold. The ship sunk only partially, due to its location in shallow waters. She was raised, patched temporarily, and towed to the Swan Hunter shipyard at Chaguaramas, Trinidad -and then towed again to Mobile on 24 January 1943. Repairs were finished in August 1943 and the ship would subsequently return to service.

On 20 November 1944, Cornwallis left Barbados with a cargo of sugar and molasses. She left port with a crew complement of 48 including seven armed guards and a British DBS. The ship's captain, Emerson Robinson, was instructed to sail unescorted through the Cape Cod Canal and then up the coast of New England before finally arriving at their destination Saint John.

The crew attempted to lower the amidships lifeboat on the starboard side but the lifeboat was caught on the davits rendering it unusable. The ship sank on her starboard side in under ten minutes. Of the 48 crew members, only 6 would escape the sinking vessel and make their way to a lifeboat which had floated free when the vessel sunk. The survivors would later be picked up by the fishing vessel Notre Dame with one perishing en route due to hypothermia. The five survivors would be dropped off at Rockland, Maine.
