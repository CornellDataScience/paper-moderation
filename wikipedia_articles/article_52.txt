== Club career ==


=== San Lorenzo ===
Born in Buenos Aires, Gonzalo started playing with San Lorenzo de Almagro. He made his Primera División debut on 26 July 2002 at the age of 18, against Rosario Central.
At age 20, Rodríguez had already represented Argentina, previously having appeared at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship with the under-20 team.


=== Villarreal ===
In July 2004, Rodríguez signed for Spain's Villarreal CF, being an undisputed starter in his first two seasons and renewing his contract for a further five years. However, after the surprise elimination from the UEFA Intertoto Cup at the hands of NK Maribor, in which he was sent off, and a month into the league campaign, he suffered a serious injury, tearing the cruciate ligament in his right knee; after returning to activity in April 2007, he suffered the same injury two months later.
Rodríguez returned to good form in 2008–09, often partnering Uruguayan Diego Godín and totalling 48 La Liga games over two seasons, with his side always qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, finishing fifth and seventh respectively. On 7 April 2011, in the Europa League quarter-final tie against FC Twente, he broke his fibula following a tough challenge by Marc Janko, being rushed to hospital in an ambulance and lost for the remainder of the season.


=== Fiorentina ===
In early August 2012, following Villarreal's relegation, Gonzalo joined ACF Fiorentina alongside his teammate Borja Valero. He scored six Serie A goals from 35 appearances in his first year, helping to a final fourth place and the subsequent Europa League qualification.
In the 2015–16 season, Rodríguez was named new team captain by new manager Paulo Sousa. He made his 200th competitive appearance for the Italian club on 9 April 2017, and marked the occasion with his 25th goal in a 2–2 away draw against UC Sampdoria.


=== Return to San Lorenzo ===
Rodríguez returned to San Lorenzo in July 2017, on a free transfer. On 23 June 2020, the 36-year-old announced his retirement.
