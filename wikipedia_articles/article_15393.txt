Liverpool Exchange was a borough constituency within the city of Liverpool in England, centred on Liverpool Exchange railway station.  It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post system.
The constituency was created under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election.  It was abolished for the February 1974 election, when it was merged with Liverpool Scotland to form Liverpool Scotland Exchange.


== Boundaries ==
The constituency covered the centre of the city of Liverpool, bordering on the River Mersey. It included the commercial area of the city, as well as poorer housing. It originally consisted of the wards of Vauxhall, St Ann Street, Lime Street, Exchange, and St Paul's.


=== 1885–1918 ===
The Exchange Ward, with a significant Conservative business vote, was combined with the St Anne's and Vauxhall wards (which were more Liberal and contained a substantial Irish vote).
The Scotland division, to the north of this seat, was more heavily Irish and returned an Irish Nationalist MP. Exchange was a Liberal/Conservative and Allies marginal constituency and its elections were influenced by what guidance the electors were given by Nationalist leaders.


=== 1918–1950 ===
In this period the seat was defined as comprising the Abercromby, Castle Street, Exchange, Great George, St Anne's, St Peter's, and Vauxhall wards.
In this era the area was represented by Conservative Members of Parliament, until the Labour Party captured the seat in 1945.


=== 1950–1955 ===
Brunswick, and Granby wards were added to those previously in the seat.


=== 1955–1974 ===
The constituency comprised Abercromby, Central, Granby, Low Hill, and St James wards.
In the redistribution which took effect in 1974, this seat disappeared. However the successor constituency was named Liverpool Scotland Exchange, combining as it did the central and northern riverside parts of the city.
