== History ==
When Seoul was expanding outward on its size, many parts of Gyeonggi Province were merged to Seongdong District. However, due to its extraordinarily huge size, Seoul Metropolitan Government divided the district into 5 (Gangnam District, Gangdong District, Gwangjin District, Seongdong District, and Songpa District)[1], and made Seongdong District cede some part of the district to Jung District. Yeongdeungpo District, Seodaemun District, Seongbuk District, and Dongdaemun District underwent similar changes.
