Krrish is an Indian media franchise of superhero films, television series, comics and video games. The film series is directed, produced and written by Rakesh Roshan. Krrish is considered Indian cinema's first such film series. All three films star Rakesh's son Hrithik. The films are centred, initially, on a mentally disabled boy who has an encounter with an extraterrestrial being, and later, his son, who grows up to be a reluctant superhero Krrish.
In 2013, an animated television series based on this Krrish film series, and named Kid Krrish, aired on Cartoon Network India. It also spawned a spin-off animated/live-action series titled J Bole Toh Jadoo that aired on Nickelodeon (India). Krrish 3 was the first Indian film to launch its own official Facebook Emoticons as part of the promotion. Krrish is the tenth highest-grossing film series in India.


== Theatrical films ==

The film series covers the story of three generations of the Mehra family. It first begins with Dr. Sanjay Mehra (Rakesh Roshan) and his wife Sonia (Rekha) who are part of a car crash. Dr. Mehra has died while Sonia, who is pregnant, survives with injuries. This results in their son, Rohit Mehra (Hrithik Roshan), being born developmentally disabled. After receiving supernatural abilities from an alien he befriends, Rohit marries his best friend Nisha (Preity Zinta) by the end of the first film. Their son, Krishna Mehra (also Hrithik Roshan) is born with the same supernatural powers in the second film (Krrish) which he uses to help people, eventually turning into the superhero 'Krrish'. He is later romantically involved with city girl Priya (Priyanka Chopra). By the end of the second film, the characters Sonia, Rohit, Krishna, and Priya are the only members of the family that are still alive while Nisha died a few days after Krishna's birth. The third film shows the entry of Kaal (Vivek Oberoi) who was created by Dr. Siddharth Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) during an experiment on Rohit thus being Rohit's second son and the main antagonist of the film. Kaal apparently kills Krrish but he is saved by Rohit who dies while giving life to the dead Krrish through his solar experiment. Krishna finally kills Kaal and by the end of the third film, Krishna, Priya and their son, Rohit (named after his grandfather Rohit Mehra) are alive while Sonia died somewhere between the events of Krrish and Krrish 3 and Krrish 4.

However, Rohit wakes up and summons the aliens to return for Jadoo. Using his enhanced abilities, Rohit arrives in time to rescue Jadoo and manages to send him in his species spaceship.

=== Krrish (2006) ===

Five-year-old orphan Krishna Mehra is undergoing an intelligence quotient test by his professors, who suspect he has high IQ and physical abilities. His grandmother Sonia (Rekha) takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village in northern India to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) meets Priya (Priyanka Chopra) when she vacations in the country. Krishna and Priya grow close just before she departs for her home in Singapore.
To appease her boss, Priya calls Krishna to join her in Singapore, where she tries to get him to perform heroic acts. Krishna does not, as he had promised his grandmother that he would hide his abilities. Krishna learns that his father Rohit was hired to help design a machine to see the future by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah). He further learned that Rohit had been killed by Dr. Siddhant when he tried to destroy the machine, after learning of Siddhant's evil intentions. This caused his mother, Nisha (Preity Zinta), to die of a broken heart.
Krishna later goes to a circus where an explosion occurs. He puts on a mask to hide his identity in order to save some trapped children, after which he is given the identity of superhero Krrish. Vikram Sinha (Sharat Saxena), who has been searching for Krishna for years, informs Krishna that his father Rohit is alive and Dr. Siddhant has been holding him captive. Krishna follows Siddhant to his island lair, where a huge fight ensues between Krrish and the doctor's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. In the final scene, Krrish mortally wounds Siddhant. Before he dies, Siddhant asks Krrish who he is, and Krishna reveals himself. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and Rohit back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit finds out his wife, Nisha, died after he disappeared. He mourns her, together with his son and mother, but still thanks Jadoo (who is somewhere between the stars) for giving his family this gift.


=== Krrish 3 (2013) ===

Rohit Mehra (Hrithik Roshan), who is a professional scientist now, is living a happy life in Mumbai along with his son Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) who is now married to Priya (Priyanka Chopra). While working in the laboratory, Rohit invents a device to bring back the life of dead tissue using solar energy through reflections but failed to complete it because of the high intensity of sun rays. Priya works as a journalist for Aaj Tak whereas Krishna is struggling hard to keep a steady job while helping the city with his superpowers as the superhero 'Krrish'.
Somewhere in an isolated area, the owner of Kaal laboratories, Kaal (Vivek Oberoi), who has extraordinary telepathic powers, is completely handicapped with his body except his brain and two fingers. He has been creating powerful human-animal mutants (or Maanvars he calls them) using his DNA, particularly the ruthless chameleon mutant Kaya (Kangana Ranaut) who can assume any form she wants. Kaal has been trying hard to cure himself but has been unsuccessful thus far. He dreams of making billions by first creating dangerous viruses using his DNA, spreading them in densely populated areas and then selling his own antidotes.
Kaal chooses India as his next target and with Kaya and other mutants' help, he spreads his newly created virus in Mumbai which creates havoc among the city. Rohit, Krishna, and Priya remain unaffected by the virus. Rohit manages to create an antidote using Krishna's blood and Krishna spreads it throughout the city via explosions for quick effect. For this, Kaal's mutants attack and thrash Rohit's laboratory but Rohit and Priya are saved by Krrish. Priya is injured and hospitalized while one of the mutants is also injured which is kept in scientific custody by Rohit and his team. To find out how an antidote was developed without using his own blood, Kaal kidnaps Priya who is pregnant with Krishna's child and Kaya takes Priya's form. Rohit and Krishna are informed that Priya has lost her child. Afterward, Kaya starts living as Priya with Krishna and seeks for the antidote formula. Rohit departs to Singapore to explore some answers after he finds out that the virus has a link with his own DNA and Kaal laboratories as well. Meanwhile, Kaya develops an attraction towards Krishna but he soon discovers her true identity and reveals himself as Krrish to her. Kaya decides to help Krishna and discloses that Priya and her child are still safe in Kaal's hideout.
In Singapore, Rohit is kidnapped by Kaal's men. Rohit unveils to Kaal that he was kidnapped by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) who tried to create a synonymous avatar of the former but got only a disabled child and donated him into an orphanage where the boy was adopted by a wealthy family, who eventually grows up to become Kaal. Kaal cures himself by using Rohit's body serum. Krishna saves Priya after killing the mutants and finally reaches the correct hideout with Kaya's help where Kaal kills both of them. Kaal then surrounds himself completely into a steel body due to his powerful magnetic powers and departs to Mumbai in search of Priya meanwhile causing destruction to the city.
Angered by Krishna's death, Rohit decides to bring Krrish back to life by using the device invented by him but sacrifices himself to absorb the high intensity of sunlight. Krrish, now thrice as powerful as before, comes after him and saves Priya. Krrish, unable to crush Kaal after brutally fighting with him, concludes that the latter could be demolished by melting his steel body. He quickly adjusts the mirrors for reflection and points Rohit's device towards Kaal whose steel body melts finally. The film ends with Priya delivering a baby which also shows signs of extraordinary power.

In September 2016, Rakesh Roshan announced the fourth installment of the franchise. Rakesh Roshan said, “When my wife showed me a tweet with Bappa’s (Lord Ganesha) picture as Krrish, it reaffirmed my belief that Krrish is the original superhero we have. It boosted my confidence and inspired me to make the fourth installment.” The movie was supposed to be released during Christmas 2020, but the production got delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2024, it is still in production. Hrithik also tweeted about the film, sharing a photograph of Lord Ganesha dressed as Krrish.
