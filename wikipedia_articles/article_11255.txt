The 6th Division was a unit of the Reichswehr.


== Creation ==
In the Order of 31 July 1920 for the Reduction of the Army (to comply with the upper limits on the size of the military contained in the Treaty of Versailles), it was determined that in every Wehrkreis (military district) a division would be established by 1 October 1920. The 6th Division was formed in January 1921 out of the Reichswehr's 7th and 10th Brigades, both part of the former Übergangsheer (Transition Army).
It consisted of 3 infantry regiments, the 16th, 17th and 18th Infantry Regiments. It also included the 6th (Prussian) Artillery Regiment, an engineering battalion, a signals battalion, a transportation battalion, and a medical battalion. It was subordinated to Gruppenkommando 2.
The commander of Wehrkreis VI was simultaneously the commander of the 6th Division. For the leadership of the troops, an Infanterieführer and an Artillerieführer were appointed, both subordinated to the commander of the division. 
The unit ceased to exist as such after October 1934, and its subordinate units were transferred to the 21 new divisions created in that year.
