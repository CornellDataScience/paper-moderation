Peckham Rye  is an interchange station between the Windrush line of the London Overground and National Rail services operated by Southeastern, Southern and Thameslink, located in Peckham town centre in South London.


== History ==
It opened on 1 December 1865 for London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) trains and on 13 August 1866 for London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) trains. It was designed by Charles Henry Driver (1832–1900), the architect of Abbey Mills and Crossness pumping stations, who also designed the grade II listed Denmark Hill and Battersea Park stations between here and ‹See TfM›London Victoria.


== Layout and routes ==
It is between Denmark Hill and Queens Road Peckham on the Windrush line, between Denmark Hill and Nunhead on the Catford loop line, and between Queens Road Peckham and East Dulwich on the Portsmouth Line. It is in Travelcard Zone 2 and is 3 miles 36 chains (5.6 km) measured from ‹See TfM›London Bridge or 5 miles 13 chains (8.3 km) measured from ‹See TfM›London Victoria.
Peckham Rye is a major interchange served by four different routes. Its platforms are on two separate viaducts with a single ticket hall at ground level. Platforms 1 and 2 are on the south viaduct and served by Southern services (London Bridge via Tulse Hill to Beckenham Junction and East Croydon), and Windrush line (London Overground) services (Clapham Junction to Dalston Junction). Platforms 3 and 4 are on the north viaduct and served by Thameslink (Blackfriars to Sevenoaks) and Southeastern (Victoria to Dartford).

=== Refurbishment ===
Ticket gates were installed in May 2009 and during late 2010 the station was refurbished as part of a 'deep clean' by Southern. A former waiting room for platforms 2 and 3, bricked up for 55 years, was partially restored and temporarily re-opened with a permanent re-opening being planned.


=== Future improvements ===
Peckham Rye is planned to become a step-free station. The project was planned to be completed in 2021, but has been delayed to 2024. The step-free project, alongside a major station rebuild, is expected to request government funding in 2022, and if approved, construction will start in September 2023 and be completed in late Summer 2025.
