The qualifying phase of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League was played from 2 July to 8 August, to define 29 entrants in the competition's play-off round, who would then in turn compete for a place in the group stage.
All times were CEST (UTC+2).


== Round and draw dates ==
All draws were held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.

Matches might have been played on Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of the regular Thursdays due to scheduling conflicts.


== Format ==
In the qualifying phase and play-off round, each tie was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e., if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out.
In the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. For these draws (or in any cases where the result of a tie in the previous round was not known at the time of the draw), the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advanced to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form "groups" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and for ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other, and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.


== Teams ==
A total of 133 teams were involved in the first three qualifying rounds, 29 of which advanced to the play-off round.
Below were the participating teams (with their 2013 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.
