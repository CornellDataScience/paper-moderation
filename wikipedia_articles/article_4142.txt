The 2024 FIDE Circuit is a system comprising the top chess tournaments in 2024, which serves as a qualification path for the Candidates Tournament 2026. Players receive points based on their performance and the strength of the tournament. A player's final Circuit score is the sum of their seven best results of the year. The winner of the Circuit qualifies for the Candidates Tournament 2026.

== Points system ==


=== Event points ===
Circuit points obtained by a player from a tournament are calculated as follows:

  
    
      
        P
        =
        B
        ×
        k
        ×
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle P=B\times k\times w}
  

where:

  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
 - Points obtained by player from the tournament

  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
  
 - Basic points

  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  
 - Tournament strength factor, calculated as 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        (
        T
        A
        R
        −
        2500
        )
        
          /
        
        100
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=(TAR-2500)/100}
  

  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}
  
 - Tournament weighting
1.0 - Standard classical tournaments
0.8 - World Rapid Championships
0.6 - World Blitz Championships and other Rapid tournaments
0.5 - Mixed Rapid & Blitz tournaments
0.4 - Blitz tournaments


=== Basic points ===
Basic points for a tournament are awarded depending on the tournament format:

Swiss-system: Top 8 (within top half of ranking), ties included.
Round-robin: Top 3 with ties (with the exception of the Candidates Tournament 2024 where points are awarded to all players).
Knockout: Third round or later, up to 8 players.
Points are awarded as follows:

If the tournament is won outright, basic points for 1st place would be 11 points. Otherwise, 10 basic points would be used for calculation.
For tied positions, basic points are calculated as 50% of points for final ranking as determined by tournament's tie-break rules, plus 50% of the sum of basic points assigned for the tied places divided by the number of tied players. If no tie-break rule is applied, basic points are 100% shared equally among all tied players.
For round-robin tournaments (other than Candidates), 4th and below are worth zero points for tied players calculation.


=== FIDE World Championship points ===
For the World Chess Championship 2024, the winner will get points calculated as 1st place basic points multiplied by the strength factor, but with its TAR value using winner's performance rating instead.


=== Player's total and ranking ===
A player's point total for the ranking is the sum of their best 7 tournaments with the following criteria:

If player has 6 or 7 tournaments to count:
No more than 4 or 5 respectively standard tournaments with the participation of less than 50 players can be counted.
No more than 2 rapid/blitz tournaments can be counted.
If player has 5 tournaments or less:
No more than 4 standard tournaments with participation of less than 50 players can be counted.
