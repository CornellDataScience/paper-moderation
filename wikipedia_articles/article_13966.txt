On 28 January 2014, Dja Djédjé signed a four-and-a-half-year deal with Ligue 1 club Olympique de Marseille. After sitting on the bench for some matches early in his Marseille career, Dja Djédjé quickly became a regular starter, displacing Rod Fanni as the club's first-choice right back.
In the 2014–15 season, Dja Djédjé operated as a wing back in several matches as manager Marcelo Bielsa looked for him to provide width and support for Marseille's wide attacks.
On 20 January 2016, he scored his first and only goal for Marseille in the Coupe de France in a 2–0 home win against Montpellier.


=== Watford ===
On 21 July 2016, Dja Djédjé joined Premier League side Watford for £3 million on a four-year deal. However, a foot injury meant he was left out of the Hornets' Premier League squad for the first half of the 2016–17 season. He made his debut for Watford in an FA Cup tie with Burton Albion on 7 January 2017. On 22 August 2018, Watford terminated Dja Djédjé's contract by mutual consent.

On 17 August 2018, Dja Djédjé joined Süper Lig side Ankaragücü with a two-year deal. He left the club in mid May 2019.


== International career ==
Dja Djédjé made his debut for Ivory Coast on 14 August 2013 in a 4–1 friendly defeat to Mexico. He rejected the chance to appear at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, deciding to opt for the guaranteed starting place at Marseille instead of a lesser role with the national team.
