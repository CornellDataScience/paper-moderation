Eigo de Shabera Night (英語でしゃべらナイト, Eigo de shabera naito) is a Japanese talk show by NHK. The show began in 2003 and ended in 2009, but is ongoing as a special program. Contrary to the title, Japanese is the main language used in the show, although the Japanese hosts use English when interviewing British, American or Irish celebrities, such as Noel Gallagher, Howard Stringer and Colin Farrell, or when the English language is discussed.
Pakkun Eiken (パックン英検) is a quiz where Patrick Harlan defines a certain word in English, after which contestants must produce the word in question. Other sections of the show include London Online and The Strongest English Project in History!? (史上最強!?の英語プロジェクト, Shijou Saikyou!? no Eigo Purojekuto).
At the end of its run in 2009, NHK announced that regular episodes of the show would be cancelled, but that "special editions of the program will be aired on an irregular basis".
