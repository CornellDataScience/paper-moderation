Georgia participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2020, which was held in Warsaw, Poland on 29 November 2020. Sandra Gadelia was selected through the televised show Ranina. She achieved 6th place with 111 points.


== Background ==

Prior to the 2020 contest, Georgia had participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest twelve times since its debut in 2007, and since then they have never missed a single contest. Georgia is also the most successful country in the competition, with three victories in 2008, 2011 and 2016.
In the 2019 contest, Giorgi Rostiashvili carried the Georgian flag to Gliwice Arena's stage with We Need Love following his victory in the second season of Ranina, achieving just the 14th place out of 19 with 69 points.

=== Ranina ===
For the third year in a row, Georgia will use an original children's talent show format, Ranina (Georgian: რანინა), as the selection method for their artist. The third season was originally planned to be around two months long starting in late March. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the show to be suspended indefinitely. On 13 July 2020, public broadcaster GPB released a new advertising spot for Ranina confirming its return, with recordings due to commence in the following weeks and a revamped format to adjust to the shorter time available. On 18 August 2020, GPB released footage of the first five rehearsals on Facebook and announced that the first show would be premiered on 4 September 2020 at 22:00 Georgian time — though all references to that were deleted a day later. Classical pianist David Aladashvili will continue as the main host of the show, this time joined by Lika Evgenidze as co-host. A new advertisement was released three days later, on 21 August 2020, postponing the season premiere for a week to 11 September 2020.

=== Voting ===
The same voting system that was introduced in the 2017 edition was used, where the results were determined by 50% online voting and 50% jury voting. Every country had a national jury that consisted of three music industry professionals and two children aged between 10 and 15 who were citizens of the country they represented. The rankings of those jurors were combined to make an overall top ten.
The online voting consisted of two phases. The first phase of the online voting began on 27 November 2020 when a recap of all the rehearsal performances was shown on the contest's website Junioreurovision.tv before the viewers could vote. After this, voters also had the option to watch longer one-minute clips from each participant's rehearsal. This first round of voting ended on 29 November at 15:59 CET. The second phase of the online voting took place during the live show and began right after the last performance and was open for 15 minutes. International viewers were able vote for three songs. They were also able to vote for their own country's song. These votes were then turned into points which were determined by the percentage of votes received. For example, if a song received 10% of the votes, it received 10% of the available points.
During the live show, Georgia received 42 points from online voting, out of 697 total.
