== History ==

The name Nasuno was first introduced on 22 September 1959 for semi-express (準急, junkyū) services operating between Ueno in Tokyo and Kuroiso on the Tōhoku Main Line. In 1966, this was upgraded to become an express (急行, kyūkō), and on 14 March 1985, it was upgraded to become a Limited express using 185 series EMU rolling stock. From 10 March 1990, the train was rerouted to operate between Shinjuku in Tokyo and Kuroiso.
On 10 December 1995, the name was adopted for the new all-stations services on the Tōhoku Shinkansen. The Tōhoku Main Line services to and from Shinjuku were renamed Ohayō Tochigi and Hometown Tochigi from this date. Prior to 1995, Aoba services formed the all-stations services along the whole line. However, with the introduction of short-distance Nasuno services, Aoba services were reduced, and in 1997, discontinued altogether, with the local services covered by Nasuno as far as Kōriyama, and all further stations served by the Yamabiko.
