K-146 is a 15.564-mile-long (25.048 km) east–west state highway in eastern Kansas, United States. K-146's western terminus is at U.S. Route 59 (US-59) north of Erie in Neosho County. The eastern terminus is at K-3 northwest of Girard in Crawford County. The main purpose of the route is to serve the small city of Walnut. The highway is two-lanes for its entire length, and no part of it is included in the National Highway System.
On October 19, 1954, it was approved that once Neosho and Crawford counties had upgraded the roadway, that it would be added to the state highway system. At the meeting held on April 11, 1956, the highway had received the required upgrades, at which time it was added to that state highway system as K-146. The route has not been modified since its designation. The route is maintained by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT).

== History ==
In a meeting on October 19, 1954, it was approved that once Neosho and Crawford counties had upgraded the roadway to state highway standards, that it would be added to the state highway system. By the meeting held on April 11, 1956, the highway had received the required upgrades, at which time it was added to that state highway system as K-146. The highway first appears as a state highway on the 1957-58 state highway map but without a number. It was paved when it appeared on this map. K-146 first appears numbered on the 1960-61 edition of the state highway map. The route has not been modified since its designation.
