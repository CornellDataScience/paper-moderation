Titoudao is a play by Singaporean playwright Goh Boon Teck. It was first staged in Singapore at the Jubilee Hall Raffles Hotel by theatre company, Toy Factory Productions, in 1994. The play was restaged again in 2000, 2007, 2015 and 2024. In 2020, the play was adapted into a TV series on Mediacorp’s Channel 5 and Channel 8.


== Synopsis ==
A play trailing the encounters of a street Wayang performer, one of the few left in that generation, Titoudao is inspired by Madam Oon Ah Chiam, the mother of its scriptwriter, Goh Boon Teck. Titoudao uncovers the struggles of street opera performers in Singapore through a play-within-a-play set in the 1940s. This play reflects the gender inequality coupled with poverty faced by Ah Chiam in that era as she navigates through her career. Titoudao is the name of the most popular character, a male servant.


=== Act one ===
The first act of the show employed the approach of a play within a play to depict the hardships of Ah Chiam's family as her and her younger sister, Ah Dui had to be sent to a street opera troupe for opera training.
This act comprises scenes of Ah Chiam performing in her most successful play — Titoudao. Titoudao is a story about a reputable family's loyal servant, Titoudao and his master, Ti Boon Long. The once-glorious Ti family ended up in shambles after Boon Long's father, a top magistrate's demise. The master-servant duo were forced to embark on a trip to Boon Long's betrothed wife's family, the Teng household to seek financial support for Boon Long's imperial examination in Beijing. However, the duo's fate did not go well after Boon Long's supposed betrothed spouse, Teng Lay Kiao and her mother, Diao Si mistook them for beggars. They despised them after learning Ti family's misfortunes, ruthlessly turning down their pleas. Fortunately, the compassionate older step-sister of Lay Kiao, the complete opposite of her counterpart, Teng Swee Lian extended her benevolence to the desperate man with great ambitions.
The opening act then reverts to the reality of Ah Chiam and Ah Dui in the opera troupe as they start their first day of mentorship.


=== Act two ===
The second act unravels Ah Chiam's budding love story, providing a glimpse into her personal life outside of her wayang times. It showcases the comical romance between Ah Chiam and her friend's older brother, Thiam Hock which started out seemingly awkward and the sad reality of marriage and life with in-laws for women in that era. Despite these, Ah Chiam's undying passion for acting surpasses her obstacles, motivating her greatly in life.
The act includes a scene of the true Madam Oon Ah Chiam appearing on stage, recollecting her wayang experiences and rekindling her love for street opera. This break in fourth wall appeals to the audience, urging them to appreciate this traditional form of street performance unique to Singapore's heritage. The production concluded with a finale of the play within the play, Titoudao, with Madam Oon Ah Chiam joining the casts.
