The Pennec Gaz'Aile 2 (English: a combination of Gazelle and wing) is a French amateur-built aircraft, designed by Serge Pennec of Locmaria-Plouzané and supplied in the form of plans for amateur construction.


== Design and development ==
The Gaz'Aile 2 features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear with wheel pants and a single engine in tractor configuration.
The aircraft is made from wood and klegcell foam. Its 7.10 m (23.3 ft) span wing employs a 15.80% thickness airfoil, has an area of 5.66 m2 (60.9 sq ft) and mounts flaps, as well as winglets. The standard engines recommended are the 52 hp (39 kW) Peugeot PSA 106 automotive conversion diesel engine and a 80 hp (60 kW) Peugeot petrol engine, as well as a number of other PSA Peugeot Citroën powerplants. The PSA 106 engine burns Jet-A and offers a very low fuel cruise fuel consumption of 6.8 litres (1.5 imp gal; 1.8 US gal) per hour.
