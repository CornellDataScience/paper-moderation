M is an English new wave and synth-pop music project that formed in 1978 in London, England by Robin Scott. M is most known for the 1979 hit "Pop Muzik", which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart in May 1979, and number one in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart on 3 November 1979. Musicians who contributed to M at one time or another included Wally Badarou, Mark King, Phil Gould and Gary Barnacle of Level 42.

=== One man band ===
Robin Scott first used the pseudonym M in 1978, when he released the single "Moderne Man". His next single, "Pop Muzik", featured Scott's brother Julian on bass, his wife Brigit Novik on backing vocals, and Wally Badarou on keyboards. The album New York–London–Paris–Munich was released in 1979.
M had three other singles that achieved a chart entry in the UK, "Moonlight and Muzak" (No. 33 in December 1979), "That's the Way the Money Goes" (No. 45 in March 1980) and "Official Secrets" (No. 64 in November 1980). M released three studio albums throughout their career so far: New York • London • Paris • Munich in 1979, The Official Secrets Act in 1980, and Famous Last Words, mostly recorded in 1982, but wasn't released in the UK until 2000. A fourth album, Robin Scott with Shikisha, was recorded in 1984 but wasn't released until 1998.
M's first single "Moderne Man" was later remixed with "Satisfy Your Lust", the B-side of "That's the Way the Money Goes", and appeared as a medley on M's album New York • London • Paris • Munich.  The original single releases appeared on the 1997 CD re-release. A remixed version of "Pop Muzik" was played before each concert of U2's PopMart Tour.
On 23 June 2023, Scott released "Break the Silence", the first new single by M in 43 years.
