== History ==
Francis Marion Smith and William Tell Coleman's company, the Harmony Borax Works, established Greenland Ranch in 1883, named after the green alfalfa fields which they planted there. They established a weather station at the ranch in 1891. Greenland Ranch was renamed Furnace Creek Ranch in 1933.
The Timbisha tribe currently live at the Death Valley Indian Community reservation here.  They provided many of the artisans and builders to construct the original Fred Harvey Company resort buildings, the Indian Village, and Park Service structures. They compose the majority of residents of Furnace Creek's permanent population at the tribe's reservation. Furnace Creek was formerly the center of Death Valley mining and operations for the Pacific Coast Borax Company and the historic 20-Mule Teams hauling wagon trains of borax across the Mojave Desert.


== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Furnace Creek has a total area of 31.5 square miles (82 km2), over 99% of it being land.
Springs in the Amargosa Range created a natural oasis at Furnace Creek, which has subsequently dwindled due to diversion of this water to support the village.


=== Climate ===
Furnace Creek, like the rest of Death Valley, has a subtropical, hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh), with long, extremely hot summers; short, warm winters; and little rainfall. Daytime temperatures range from roughly 65 °F (18 °C) in December to 116 °F (47 °C) in July, while overnight lows typically oscillate from 40 °F (4 °C) to 90 °F (32 °C).

During that period, the hottest month was July, with an average daily high temperature of 116.5 °F (46.9 °C), and the driest month was June, with an average monthly precipitation of 0.05 in (1.3 mm). Furnace Creek holds the record for the most consecutive days above 120 °F (49 °C): 43 days, from July 6 through August 17, 1917.

Furnace Creek holds the record for the highest recorded temperature in the world, reaching 134 °F (56.7 °C) on July 10, 1913. Some meteorologists dispute the accuracy of this measurement.
In addition, a ground temperature of 201 °F (94 °C) was recorded in Furnace Creek on July 15, 1972; this may be the highest natural ground surface temperature ever recorded. (Temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 50 to 90 °F (30 to 50 °C).) The former world record for the highest overnight low temperature was 110.0 °F (43.3 °C), set on July 5, 1918, in Furnace Creek.

Near Furnace Creek is California Historical Landmark number 442, Death Valley '49ers Gateway, assigned on October 24, 1949.  The marker is at the corner of State Route 190 and Badwater Road.
The California Historical Landmark reads:

NO. 442 DEATH VALLEY GATEWAY - Through this natural gateway the Death Valley '49ers, more than 100 emigrants from the Middle West seeking a shortcut to gold fields of central California, entered Death Valley in December 1849. All suffered from thirst and starvation. Seeking an escape from the region, two contingents went southwest from here, while the others proceeded northwest.

It is these emigrants who are said to have given Death Valley its uninviting name.
