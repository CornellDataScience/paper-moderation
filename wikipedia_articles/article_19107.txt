Edward is an English male name. It is derived from the Anglo-Saxon name Ēadweard, composed of the elements ēad "wealth, fortunate; prosperous" and weard "guardian, protector”.


== History ==
The name Edward was very popular in Anglo-Saxon England, but the rule of the Norman and Plantagenet dynasties had effectively ended its use amongst the upper classes. The popularity of the name was revived when Henry III named his firstborn son, the future Edward I, as part of his efforts to promote a cult around Edward the Confessor, for whom Henry had a deep admiration.


== Variant forms ==

The name has been adopted in the Iberian peninsula since the 15th century, due to Edward, King of Portugal, whose mother was English. The Spanish/Portuguese forms of the name are Eduardo and Duarte. Other variant forms include French Édouard, Italian Edoardo and Odoardo, German, Dutch, Czech and Romanian Eduard and Scandinavian Edvard.
Short forms include   Ed, Eddy, Eddie,  Ted, Teddy and Ned.
