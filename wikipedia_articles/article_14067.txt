Nepean FC are a semi-professional football (soccer) club, from the Penrith and St Marys suburbs in Western Sydney. The club was founded in 2011. The Men's team currently plays in the NSW State League, the fourth tier of football in New South Wales and the fifth tier in Australia when including the national competition, the A-League.


== History ==
The area has been previously represented by a number of clubs, most recently Penrith Nepean United who folded in 2009 whilst competing in the NSW Premier League.
In the absence of representative football in the Penrith area, the Nepean District Soccer Football Association, (now Nepean Football Association) set out to create a club and a pathway for local footballers to play at a representative level.
Nepean FC were the hosts and opponents of new A-League club Western Sydney Wanderers first ever match. The match took place at Cook Park in front of more than 3500 spectators. Nepean FC lost the match 5–0 with Joey Gibbs grabbing four goals.
Despite finishing last in State League Division 2 in 2012, Nepean FC were placed in State League Division 1 for 2013 when Football NSW undertook a significant restructure of the league system to meet the criteria of the nationally implemented National Premier Leagues.
In 2014 the Women's team recorded Nepean FC's best result to date by winning the Women's State League and securing promotion to the 2015 National Premier Leagues Division 2.
