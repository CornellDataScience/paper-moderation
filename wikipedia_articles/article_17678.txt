Cæcilie Norby (born 9 September 1964) is a Danish jazz and rock singer. She has performed as part of the bands Street Beat, Frontline, and One-Two. Since the mid-1990s, she has worked as a solo artist.


== Career ==

Norby was a founding member of the band Street Beat in 1982. For two years, she was a member of the jazz-rock band Frontline. From 1985 to 1993, she worked with singer Nina Forsberg in the rock band One-Two.
In 1995, she turned to jazz and released her first solo album for Blue Note, titled Cæcilie Norby. The self-titled debut recording was co-produced by Niels Lan Doky as was followed by her album My Corner of the Sky in 1996. My Corner of the Sky prominently featured American musicians, including David Kikoski, Joey Calderazzo, Terri Lyne Carrington, Scott Robinson, Randy Brecker, and Michael Brecker. The repertoire for both albums included only a few jazz standards like "Summertime" or "Just One of Those Things". Instead, she and Lan Doky arranged classic popular songs for a jazz line-up, like "Wild Is the Wind", "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" and a track by Curtis Mayfield on the first album, "The Look of Love", "Life on Mars", "Spinning Wheel" and "Set Them Free" by Sting on the second. For both albums Norby also wrote lyrics to compositions by Randy Brecker, Chick Corea, Don Grolnick and Wayne Shorter. Both albums gained wide attention and five-digit sales, especially in Denmark and also in Japan.
Her third album Queen of Bad Excuses, released in 1999, was a collaboration between her and Lars Danielsson, who already played bass throughout My Corner of the Sky. This time all compositions are originals by Norby, while she and Danielsson arranged, programmed and produced all tracks together. Danielsson played also guitar, cello, electric piano, keyboards and even drums on one track. With Ben Besiakov and long-time companion Lars Jansson on piano, Anders Kjellberg and Per Lindvall from Sweden alternating on drums with Billy Hart, who was also part of her debut recording, the line-up is accentuated by the guitar of John Scofield on more than half of the album, and saxophonist Hans Ulrik and Xavier Desandre Navarre on percussion.
