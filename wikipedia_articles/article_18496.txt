After Operation Barbarossa, the 107th Rifle Division was transferred to the front and engaged in combat on 16 July near Yelnya. During the Battle of Smolensk, Kozin was reported to have shown leadership skills. In one action, he reportedly sent only one company in frontal attack against superior German troops and outflanked the German positions using his two other companies. This attack reportedly caused the defeat of the German troops and led to a breakthrough.
In August, Kozin became commander of the 100th Rifle Division's 85th Rifle Regiment. He fought in the Yelnya Offensive at the beginning of September. The division became the 1st Guards Rifle Division, the regiment became the 2nd Guards Rifle Regiment, and Kozin was awarded the Order of Lenin for his leadership during the offensive.

The division fought in the Battle of Voronezh during the summer. In late November, the division fought in Operation Uranus. The 63rd was part of the 21st Army's main attack and broke through the Romanian-German defenses, advancing southwards. In the area of Raspopinskaya village, the division helped fully encircle two corps of the Romanian Third Army between 21 and 22 November. The 63rd's attacks reportedly split the pocket in half and then simulated a mechanized attack using the division's motor transport battalion. On the evening of 23 November, Romanian 14th Infantry Division commander General Stanescu surrendered the 27,000 troops in the pocket. For his actions, Kozin was awarded the Order of Suvorov 2nd class and the division became the 52nd Guards Rifle Division on 27 November. The division then fought in the Soviet attacks to shrink the Stalingrad Pocket. On 21 January 1943, Kozin was promoted to major general. He was wounded and sent to the hospital.
