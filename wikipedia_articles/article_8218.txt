The Nordic Youth Council (Scandinavian: Ungdommens Nordiske Råd), abbreviated UNR, is a forum organization of the Nordic Council. It consists of the member countries' youth wing parties.


== History ==
The youth wing parties of the Nordic Council have, since the council's foundation in 1952, held independent seminars before the Nordic Council's sessions. The purpose of the seminar was to discuss the subjects on the council's agenda. 
In the late 1960s it was discussed to create an independent organization for the youth wing parties. A trial session was held in Stockholm in 1971. Creating the UNR as an independent organization was dismissed, but the yearly seminars continued. During the 70s and 80s UNR continued with yearly seminars. UNR was first able to influence the Nordic Council's session in 1987, where they were given opportunity to present the results from the seminar. 
At the Nordic Council's session in 2002 in Esbo UNR finally became an independent permanent organization. The organization was to have a president and a presidium. The organization is administered from Finland.
