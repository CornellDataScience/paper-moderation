Prince Heng of the First Rank, or simply Prince Heng, was the title of a princely peerage used in China during the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1912). As the Prince Heng peerage was not awarded "iron-cap" status, this meant that each successive bearer of the title would normally start off with a title downgraded by one rank vis-à-vis that held by his predecessor. However, the title would generally not be downgraded to any lower than a feng'en fuguo gong except under special circumstances.
The first bearer of the title was Yunqi (允祺; 1680–1732), the Kangxi Emperor's fifth son. He was granted the title "Prince Heng of the First Rank" by his father in 1709. The title was passed down over nine generations and held by 12 persons.
