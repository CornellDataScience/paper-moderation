He was to be replaced by the former Big Brother Naija housemate, Pere Egbi. Due to speculation that he relocated without notifying the show runners, Ayolola reacted to the announcent via his Instagram page writing “Contrary to what was said, I did not relocate without letting the executive producers and producers of the show know, My decision to make a ‘temporary’ move out of the country was a long thought out process in which the producer/my manager at the time was aware of and involved in. With that being said, I cannot wait to be back on your screens again."
