=== Early life ===
Stéphanie Alenda graduated from the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis in 1993, where she obtained two BA degrees (i.e., Modern Literature and Literature and Spanish Civilization), followed by a Master's degree in Literature and Spanish Civilization in 1994. While she was achieving her Postgraduate Diploma on Latin American Studies at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, she was awarded a scholarship from the French Institute for Andean Studies to conduct her doctoral fieldwork in Bolivia.
After finishing her PhD in Political Sociology at Lille University of Science and Technology in 2001, she obtained a research grant to carry out her postdoctoral studies in 2003 at the Lavoisier Programme, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
She was an assistant professor at the Institute of Public Affairs of the University of Chile and the editor of the Institute's political science journal, Revista Política (2004–2012).


=== Sociology at UNAB: 2009−present ===
In 2009, she founded the School of Sociology at Andrés Bello National University (UNAB). According to information from the university, Alenda has been part of the Executive Board of the Research Committee in Political Sociology (CPS) since 2015, which is affiliated to the International Sociological Association (ISA) and the International Political Science Association (IPSA). In 2016, she reached an agreement with the Brazilian Political Science Association (ABCP) for the CPS to have a stable presence at each meeting. In this regard, Alenda stated:

«For the UNAB, my presence in this top-level international group is very powerful, as there are only two South American members: a Brazilian and me. The president of the CPS gave me the task of establishing links with the main political science associations in Latin America and I started with Brazil».
In 2018, she became the Director of Research of UNAB Faculty of Education and Social Sciences. In the same year, she was elected to serve as the Chair of the Research Committee on Political Sociology (2018−2023).
She gained renown in January 2020 during a seminar organized by the Centre of Public Studies (Centro de Estudios Públicos; CEP) called "The Chilean right in times of change" (La derecha chilena en época de cambios), which had Carmen Le Foulon (Coordinator of the Public Opinion Area, CEP) and Julieta Suárez-Cao (Associate Professor, Institute of Political Science, PUC) as keynote speakers as well. In her presentation, she previewed the main findings of her book Anatomía de la derecha chilena: Estado, mercado y valores en tiempos de cambio (Anatomy of the Chilean Right: State, Market and Values in times of change). The presentation was commented by the presidents of the then three main parties of the right-wing coalition Chile Vamos: Mario Desbordes (RN), Hernán Larraín Matte (Evópoli) and Jacqueline van Rysselberghe (UDI). The book was published in March 2020 by the Fondo de Cultura Económica and, despite the challenges posited by the COVID-19 pandemic, the first printing quickly sold-out.
