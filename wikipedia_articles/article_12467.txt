Heritage Shunters Trust (HST) is a trading name of The South Yorkshire Railway Co. Ltd. which was founded in 1989.


== Overview ==
HST is a railway preservation society and is the only preservation society that specialises in the preservation of ex-British Railway diesel shunters in the United Kingdom, although they do have a Class 14 which is a Type 1 locomotive and not a shunter. 
Most of the locomotives are kept at Rowsley, Derbyshire, England, on the site of preserved railway Peak Rail but the company is a separate outfit. Galas are usually held twice a year where the collection is put on display and brake van rides are hauled by an assortment from the active fleet. Guided tours of the collection, and the viewing of restoration work being undertaken, are available most weekends for a small charge.


== Formation and purpose ==
The Heritage Shunters Trust (HST) was established in 1989 with the primary objective of preserving and restoring British Railway diesel shunters. These locomotives, once ubiquitous in rail yards and industrial sidings, were facing an uncertain future due to the decline of traditional shunting operations.


== Diesel locomotives ==
HST has the following locomotives.
