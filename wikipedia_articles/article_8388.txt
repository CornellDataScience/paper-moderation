== Critical reception ==
In a positive review of the album, critic Noel Murray of the AV Club said fans of Sloan and of the New Pornographers should "warm immediately to Zeus", and wrote that "after moonlighting from their gig as Jason Collett’s backing band... [they] deserve to move from the side of the stage to the front."
Critic Andrew Leahey wrote that Say Us "re-creates the sunny strains of Sloan, The Hollies, and the Beatles to charming effect."
In a neutral review, critic Pieter J Macmillan wrote that the band's democratic approach to singing and song writing lead to a remarkable coherence of sound throughout the album.  However, he continued the album's "lack of originality is felt particularly strong... in the lyrics."
