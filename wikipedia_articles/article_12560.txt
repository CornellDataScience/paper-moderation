He moved to Novohrad-Volynskyi (now Zviahel) at the age of five with his family. Here he studied at the collegium (now Lyceum No. 11).
His grandfather, father, and brother are military men.
In 2016, he graduated from the Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Ground Forces Academy with a degree in "Management of actions of mechanized troops".
On 16 March 2016 he arrived in the area of the anti-terrorist operation. Then he was appointed commander of the 1st platoon of the 2nd mechanized company of the 1st mechanized battalion of the 72nd mechanized brigade.

After 2 months he returned to combat duties (some of the shrapnel remained in his body).
At the end of January 2017, his unit repelled an attack by an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group in the industrial zone of Avdiivka. Together with an assault group led by A. Kyzyl, they captured an enemy stronghold.
At the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, he was a member of the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade defending the approaches to the cities of Boryspil and Brovary in Kyiv Oblast.
He was the organizer of the defense near the settlements of Hoholeva and Rusanova (both in Kyiv Oblast), which led to the retreat of the enemy and prevented it from advancing to Kyiv. Thanks to his professional actions, enemy personnel and armored vehicles were destroyed.
On 22 June 2022, he began to command a combined assault group to restore lost positions near the village of Vershyna, Bakhmut Raion, Donetsk Oblast.
