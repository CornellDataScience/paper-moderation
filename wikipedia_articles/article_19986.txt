The Marshall Mountains (84°37′S 164°30′E) are a group of mountains overlooking Beardmore Glacier in the Queen Alexandra Range, Antarctica. They are bounded on the north by Berwick Glacier, and on the south by Swinford Glacier.


== Exploration and name ==
The Marshall Mountains were discovered by the South Polar Party of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09, and named for Dr. Eric Marshall, surgeon and cartographer to the expedition, a member of the Polar Party.


== Location ==
The Marshall Mountains are in the southwest of the Queen Alexandra Range, to the south of Mount Falla, southwest of Mount Kirkpatrick and west of the Adams Mountains.
They are bounded by the Beardmore Glacier to the south, the Antarctic Plateau to the west and the Walcott Névé to the northwest.
Mount Marshall gives its name to the range.
Features to its southeast include Swinford Glacier, Mount Holloway, Table Bay, Mount Augusta, Skaar Ridge and Mount Wild.
Features to the north include Blizzard Peak, Blizzard Heights, Lindsay Peak, Mayeda Peak, Storm Peak, Peterson Ridge, Kenyon Peaks, Tempest Peak and Elliot Peak.
The Goodwin Nunataks lie to the west.


== Southern features ==

A peak 2.5 nautical miles (4.6 km; 2.9 mi) west of Mount Augusta at the southwest extremity of the Queen Alexandra Range. 
Discovered by the BrAE (1907-09) and named for Frank Wild, a member of the Southern Polar Party of that expedition.


=== Goodwin Nunataks ===
84°38′S 161°31′E. 
A small group of isolated nunataks lying about 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) west of Marshall Mountains, at the south side of Walcott Névé. 
Named by US-ACAN after Michael L. Goodwin, USARP geomagmetist and seismologist at South Pole Station, 1960.


== Northern features ==
Northern features include, from south to north
