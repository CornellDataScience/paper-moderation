== History ==


=== Foundation and Establishment ===
The idea to establish "Al Aqsa" university in Jerusalem was proposed in 1931 but remained a concept. The occupation of West Jerusalem and the Palestinian Diaspora hindered its realization. In the 1950s, the idea was revived, but Jordan focused on establishing a university in Amman instead. The Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem further delayed the establishment of an Arab university. In the early 1970s, discussions resumed to establish a Palestinian university, resulting in the transformation of existing institutions into universities in the West Bank. Jerusalem was overlooked once again.
In the late 1970s, independent colleges were established in Jerusalem and its surroundings. The College of Daawa and Religious Principles, College of Medical Professions, and College of Science and Technology were founded in 1978 and 1979. In 1982, the College of Hind Al-Husseini for Women and the Center for Islamic Archaeology were established.
In 1984, steps were taken to unify these colleges, aiming for recognition by the Union of Arab Universities. A coordinating committee was formed, allowing the colleges to maintain their separation. The Faculty of Medicine was founded in 1994. In 1995, all colleges and faculties officially amalgamated, establishing Al-Quds University. New centers and colleges were opened or merged, offering a comprehensive range of academic programs. The university emphasized engagement with society, becoming a distinct entity.


=== Contemporary ===

Over the past years, Al Quds University has experienced mounting pressure from the Israeli government, both politically and militarily. The Israeli West Bank barrier built in 2004 have impeded university operations. Students have been injured and many of the students studying at the university have faced tear gas and some students have been shot.
In 2013 alone, the Israeli army launched 26 separate attacks on the university campus in Abu Dis, resulting in 1,769 injuries to students and staff. Notably, one of these attacks even occurred during a visit by the U.S. Consul-General to the campus. In the early weeks of 2014, the Israeli army conducted three additional attacks on the Abu Dis campus. Staff and students frequently face summonses, arrests, and intimidation, both at the Abu Dis campus and the premises in the Old City, which have been raided and occasionally closed on multiple occasions.
Simultaneously, the university has been engaged in legal and political battles to secure its existence. Since 17 years, it has faced the threat of closure by the Israeli authorities. Despite being fully accredited and licensed by relevant Palestinian bodies, and internationally recognized, the Israeli authorities in occupied East Jerusalem, insist that the university obtain Israeli accreditation or face closure and arrests of its administration. However, Israel has also prevented the university from functioning as a unified entity, forcing it to split into two separate institutions. Al Quds University's attempts to meet Israeli requirements have been unsuccessful thus far. In 2023, Israeli Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich, planned to freeze funds for the university, which was heavily criticized by Hebrew University director, Mona Kassabri, calling it "discrimination".

The partnership ended in 2013 following a demonstration at Al-Quds in which students in military gear performed a Nazi salute and Brandeis deemed the response from the Al-Quds University administration to be "unacceptable and inflammatory". Syracuse University also terminated its partnership in 2013 following the demonstration.
