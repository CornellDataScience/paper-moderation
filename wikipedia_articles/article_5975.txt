Alex Laferriere (born October 28, 2001) is an American professional ice hockey right winger for the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL).


== Playing career ==
Laferriere was often passed over for spots on top youth ice hockey teams due to his size; he stood at only 5 ft 2 in (157 cm) by his freshman year of high school, but had a growth spurt when he was around age 16. He played youth ice hockey for the New Jersey Colonials and North Jersey Avalanche. He attended Chatham High School in his hometown, later spent time with the University of Nebraska High School and then spent a year at Kent School in Connecticut, averaging close to two points per game in the 2018–19 season. Laferriere was the second-leading player in the New England area in points per game at Kent and finished the season with 19 goals and 34 assists in 27 games.
Laferriere initially committed to play in college for the Army Black Knights but later switched to the Harvard Crimson. He also joined the Des Moines Buccaneers of the United States Hockey League (USHL) for the end of the 2018–19 season, appearing in 12 games. In 2019–20, he played 42 games for the Buccaneers and led them in scoring with 45 points, also tying for the team lead in goals (19) and assists (26). He was named the team's most valuable player and was invited to the BioSteel All-American Game. Following the season, Laferriere was selected in the third round with the 83rd overall pick of the 2020 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings. He then played 49 games in the 2020–21 season with Des Moines, totaling 50 points on 26 goals and 24 assists.
Laferriere began playing in college with Harvard starting in 2021–22, posting in his first season 31 points (14 goals, 17 assists) in 35 games, being named the ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year, to the ECAC Hockey All-Rookie team and third-team All-ECAC Hockey. He then played 34 games in 2022–23 and helped Harvard reach the NCAA tournament with 21 goals and 21 assists. He was selected second-team All-ECAC Hockey for his performance. Laferriere afterwards turned professional and played four games with the Ontario Reign of the American Hockey League (AHL), scoring one goal.

Following his first AHL season, Laferriere signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Los Angeles Kings on April 9, 2023. He was assigned to the AHL to begin the 2023–24 season but was recalled on October 9, later making his NHL debut in the Kings' season-opening game on October 11, against the Colorado Avalanche, while having four shots on goal in the 5–2 loss. Laferriere scored his first NHL goal in a 4–2 loss against the Boston Bruins on October 21.

Laferriere said that the incident helped spark his interest in ice hockey.
