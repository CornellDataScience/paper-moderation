Olmsted briefly worked as assistant director of the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts from 1929 until 1930, when she became museum director, a position she held until 1957. After stepping down as director, she was named director emeritus and curator of decorative arts at the museum.
In 1932, Olmsted founded the National Ceramic Exhibition, also known as the Ceramic Nationals, in memory of the ceramist Adelaide Alsop Robineau. By the end of the 1930s, the event, which featured a juried competition culminating in an exhibition of the winning pieces, was the most prominent showcase of new ceramic art in the United States. Under Olmsted's directorship, the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts gained an international reputation as a pioneer in the field of ceramics and displayed the works of prominent ceramic artists including Eva Zeiseil, Maria Martinez, and Maija Grotell.
The tenth National Ceramic Exhibition was presented in conjunction with an exhibit titled "Contemporary Ceramics of the Western Hemisphere" and was sponsored by IBM founder and president Thomas J. Watson.
In 1937, Olmsted was appointed a delegate to the International Exhibition in Paris by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was also a prominent supporter of federal art programs introduced as part of the New Deal.
Olmsted travelled widely throughout the United States, delivering lectures on ceramics and art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, Cornell University, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, among other institutions. She was also an art critic for The Post-Standard from 1923 to 1945.
