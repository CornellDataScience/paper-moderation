(37.9 kilometres (23.5 mi) segment)
From this head lake, the Nipukatasi River flows 3.4 kilometres (2.1 mi) to the northeast more or less parallel to the west shore of Morain Lake. Then the river branches westward to flow 4.4 kilometres (2.7 mi) into marsh areas, to the east bank of Lake Bétulaie (length: 4.3 kilometres (2.7 mi), altitude: 312 metres (1,024 ft)), which the current crosses on 3.0 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the west. Then the Nipukatasi River flows for 14.6 kilometres (9.1 mi) first for 1.1 kilometres (0.68 mi) to the north, then to the southwest more or less parallel to the northwestern shore of Lake Bétulaie through marsh areas. except on the last 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi). The river flows on the north shore of Amisquioumisca Lake as the current flows 12.5 kilometres (7.8 mi) to the southwest.


=== Segment downstream from Amisquioumisca lake ===
(77.5 kilometres (48.2 mi) segment)
Amisquioumisca Lake (length: 12.5 kilometres (7.8 mi); elevation: 302 metres (991 ft)) is the main body of water on the Nipukatasi River. Its mouth is located southwest of the lake.
From the mouth of this lake, the Nipukatasi River first flows 3.0 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the west. The river branches north to flow 8.6 kilometres (5.3 mi) to a dump from the east. Then the river reorients itself for 15.8 kilometres (9.8 mi) to the southwest. Next, the river branches north for 11.6 kilometres (7.2 mi) to the south shore of Lake Rocher (elevation 255 metres (837 ft)), which flows 26.4 kilometres (16.4 mi) (full length) to the northeast. In its last segment, the river flows 12.1 kilometres (7.5 mi) to the northeast crossing a lake (length: 6.4 kilometres (4.0 mi), altitude: 253 metres (830 ft)).
