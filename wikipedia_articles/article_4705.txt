The 21st Special Service Group (Abbr.: 21 SSG, Malay: 21 Gerup Gerak Khas), also known as the Grup Gerak Khas and the 21st Special Forces Group, serves as the command for the Malaysian Army's special forces, the Gerak Khas.  21 SSG is a fighting formation within the Malaysian Army. This unit operate independently under the Malaysian Army and directly report to the Chief of Army. The headquarters of the 21 SSG are located at Sri Iskandar Camp in Mersing, Johor.
Major General Ahmad Shuhaimi Mat Wajab has assumed command of the 21 SSG, succeeding Major General Mohd Adi Ridzwan on 10 May 2024.


== History ==
The 21st Special Service Group, formerly known as Rejimen Pertama Gerak Khas Malaysia or the 1st Malaysian Special Service Regiment, was founded on 1 August 1970, at Sungai Udang Camp in Malacca. This unit directly succeeded the Malaysian Army's special operations task force, the Malaysian Special Service Unit, and served as the spiritual successor to Malaysia's first modern special forces unit, the Malayan Special Forces.


=== Background ===
Following the conclusion of the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation in 1966, the army command contemplated disbanding the Malaysian Special Service Unit (MSSU). The MSSU, stationed at Sebatang Karah Camp in Negeri Sembilan, was a task force whose members were all commando-trained but belonged to their respective regiments or corps, including some sailors from the Royal Malaysian Navy.
In 1969, the 13 May incident occurred, leading to the MSSU's deployment to Kuala Lumpur to safeguard the weapon depot within Mindef Camp (Malay: Kem Kementah). The MSSU also collaborated with the Royal Malaysia Police's Special Branch to apprehend leaders of gangs and triads who had played a role in the racial tensions behind the scenes during the incident. The crisis was short-lived due to the swift response of both units, prompting the leadership to decide against disbanding the MSSU.


=== Established as the 1st Malaysian Special Service Regiment ===
The Malaysian Army established the 1st Malaysian Special Service Regiment (1 MSSR) in 1 August 1970 to succeed the MSSU. As a task force, MSSU members remained accountable to their original units. To address this, by 1973, MSSU members desiring to join the special forces unit had to resign from their original units and volunteer to enlist in the 1 MSSR.
In the mid-1970s, responding to the swift expansion of the Malaysian Army's special forces, the 2nd Malaysian Special Service Regiment (2 MSSR) was formed. Additionally, in 1975, the Special Warfare Training Centre (SWTC) was established to provide Gerak Khas with commando and special operations training. Given its seniority, members of the 1 MSSR were selected as instructors at SWTC.


=== Separated from the 1st Malaysian Special Service Regiment ===
On 4 April 1980, the Malaysian Army separated the command of special forces from the 1 MSSR by establishing the Malaysian Special Service Command (Malay: Markas Gerak Khas) at Imphal Camp in Kuala Lumpur. Meanwhile, the 1 MSSR and 2 MSSR continued to function as combat units. Subsequently, on 1 April 1981, the Malaysian Army renamed the Malaysian Special Service Command to the Malaysian Special Service Group (MSSG). Concurrently, the 1 MSSR was renamed the 21st Para Commando Regiment, and the 2 MSSR became the 22nd Para Commando Regiment.
Simultaneously, two new counter-revolutionary warfare and military intelligence units were formed: the 11th Special Service Regiment (11 SSR) and the 12th Special Service Regiment (12 SSR), with the purpose of providing specialised support to the Para Commando regiments. In December 1981, numerous support units were established to provide additional combat support to the combat units under MSSG. However, in 1983, the 12 SSR was disbanded, and the 11 SSR was no longer exclusively assigned to the 21st Para Commando Regiment.


=== Renamed to the 21st Special Service Group ===
In 1985, the MSSG underwent a name change and became the 21st Special Service Group as part of the Malaysian Army's initiative to standardise unit names and formalise the unit as the 21st brigade within the army. This restructuring also involved renaming units under the command of the 21 SSG. The 21st Para Commando Regiment was re-designated as the 21st Commando Regiment, and the 22nd Para Commando Regiment became the 22nd Commando Regiment.
Additionally, the 21st Engineering Squadron of the 21 SSG, now known as the 10th Squadron (Parachute), Royal Engineer Regiment was decommissioned from the 21 SSG in 1986 and transferred to the Malaysian Army's 3rd Infantry Division. The Special Warfare Training Centre was placed under the command of the Malaysian Army Training and Doctrine Command.


== Formations ==
As a nation that is part of the Commonwealth, the Malaysian military adheres to the traditions of the British Armed Forces. In the case of the 21st Special Service Group, they adopt the structure of the British Special Air Service, employing the term 'sabre squadron' instead of 'company', unlike other units within the Malaysian Army.

== Uniforms and insignia ==


=== Green beret ===
Members of Gerak Khas inherit the green beret and Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife as a symbol of commando qualification, a tradition adopted from the Royal Marines Commando. This practice originated when the initial group underwent commando training at the British Army Jungle Warfare Training School with the 40 Commando Royal Marines. Unlike the British Armed Forces or the U.S. Army, where only those who have completed the Basic Commando Course or the United States Army Special Forces selection and training are authorised to wear the green beret, all members of the 21 SSG wear the green beret, irrespective of Basic Commando Course completion.
Members who have successfully completed the Basic Commando Course have the option to wear their unit's beret backing (Malaysian renditions of the U.S. military beret flash) to distinguish themselves from non-commando-trained members. As of 2023, only those who have passed the Malaysian Special Forces Selection are allowed to don the green beret. Other members of the 21 SSG who have not yet passed the selection process continue to wear their original unit berets.


=== Shoulder sleeve insignia ===


==== Number 5 uniform (Combat uniform) ====
The insignia, alternatively referred to as a tactical formation patch (Malay: Lencana formasi taktikal), is affixed to the combat uniform and bears olive and black colours. The patch prominently showcases a roaring tiger's head with a commando dagger positioned at the centre.


==== Number 2 uniform (Bush jacket) ====
The personnel of the 21 SSG don their command insignia on the left shoulder sleeve of their number 2 uniform. The 21 SSG shoulder sleeve insignia closely resembles the beret backing but incorporates a distinct black outline. This current design draws inspiration from the insignia of the Malaysian Special Service Unit, featuring a striking depiction of a roaring tiger's head with a commando dagger at the centre. The background is a fusion of jungle green and Caribbean blue, where jungle green signifies commando specialities and serves as a representation of the colour of Islam, while Caribbean blue pays homage to the founder, 40 Commando Royal Marines.


=== Stable belt ===
Members of the 21 SSG don the number 3 uniform (work dress) paired with a green and light blue stable belt.


== Commanders ==
Since the establishment of the Malaysian Special Service Unit in 1965, 22 individuals have served as the Commander of Gerak Khas, also known as the Panglima Gerak Khas (lit. 'Commander of Special Forces') in Malay. Out of these 22 individuals, 17 have held the position of the Commander of the 21st Special Service Group (Malay: Panglima 21 Gerup Gerak Khas), which was created after 1981.


=== Commander of the 21st Special Service Group ===
The position begins after the Malaysian Special Service Command was renamed to the Malaysian Special Service Group on 1 April 1981.
