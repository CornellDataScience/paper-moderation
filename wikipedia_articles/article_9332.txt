The 2022–23 Ardal NW season (also known as the 2022–23 Lock Stock Ardal NW season for sponsorship reasons) is the second season of the new third-tier northern region football in Welsh football pyramid, part of the Ardal Leagues.

The league was made up of 16 teams competing for one automatic promotion place to Cymru North, whilst the second-placed team qualified for a play-off with the second-placed team of Ardal NE. Three teams are relegated to Tier 4.
On 21 September 2022, Rhydymwyn FC notified the Football Association of Wales of their withdrawal from the Ardal Leagues.  Announcing on Social Media, Rhydymwyn FC said: “Sad day today to announce Rhydymwyn FC & Rhydymwyn Development have resigned from @ArdalNorthwest and the Wales FA Reserve League. Our Juniors & mini teams will continue. Further statement from the club will be announced in due course.”
Bodedern Athletic withdrew from the Ardal Leagues on 7 December 2022.  In a statement, Bodedern Athletic said: “A difficult decision has been made that Bodedern Athletic have withdrawn their membership of the Ardal North West League.
After a club meeting, the small group of volunteers running the club felt they had on option but to resign. The last couple of months have been difficult in trying to field a team, as many players have departed for various reasons, and not being able to sign players because of having transfer windows in Tier 3 of Welsh football. With no help or assistance from the League there was only one outcome.”
On 24 February 2023, Llandudno Albion announced that the club will disband at the end of the current season due to the difficulty in securing a home ground. A statement on the club's Facebook page said: "After 9 years, 272 games, 862 goals, three promotions, five trophies and a FAW trophy final, this will be the last season for Llandudno Albion. As part of the tier 3 licence for next season we must have a ground share agreement in place by March 1st which is obviously not possible at Llandudno at the moment.”
