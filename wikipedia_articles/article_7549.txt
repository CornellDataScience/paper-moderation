The Girls of Enghelab protests (Persian: دختران انقلاب) are protests against the compulsory hijab in Iran, part of the wider Iranian Democracy Movement. The protests were inspired by Vida Movahed, an Iranian woman known as the Girl of Enghelab Street (Persian: دختر خیابان انقلاب), who stood in the crowd on a utility box on Enghelab Street (Revolution Street) in Tehran on 27 December 2017 during the 2017–2018 Iranian protests who tied a white headscarf, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag. She was arrested on that day and was released temporary on bail a month later, on 28 January 2018. Some people interpreted Movahed's action as being based on Masih Alinejad's call for White Wednesdays, a protest movement that the presenter at VOA Persian Television started in early 2017. Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media. These women are described as the "Girls of Enghelab Street" and the "Girls of Revolution Street" in English sources. Some of the protesters however claim that they were not following Masih Alinejad's call. The protests intensified in 2022 due to the death of Mahsa Amini.

== Islamic Republic's Penal Code ==

Under the judicial system of the Islamic Republic of Iran imposed shortly after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, article 638 of the 5th book of Islamic Penal Code, called "Sanctions and deterrent penalties", states that women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months and/or required to pay fines from Rls.50,000 to Rls.500,000. Fines are recalculated in the courts to index for inflation. This has been translated and published by the Legal Information Institute of Cornell Law School.
Article 639 of the same book says, two types of people shall be sentenced one year to ten years' imprisonment; first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second, a person who facilitates or encourages people to commit immorality or prostitution.
These are some of the laws under which some protesters were charged. During the Iranian revolution in 1979, the veil was used as a way to protest Pahlavi's government.


== Background ==
Before the Iranian Revolution, during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the hijab was not compulsory, though some Iranian women during this period wore headscarves or chador.
After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the hijab gradually became compulsory. In 1979, Ruhollah Khomeini announced that women should observe Islamic dress code; His statement sparked demonstrations, the 1979 International Women's Day protests in Tehran, which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation. Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women.
In 2018, a government-run survey dating back to 2014, was released by President Hassan Rouhani, showing that 49.8% of Iranians were against compulsory or mandatory hijab. The report was released by the Center for Strategic Studies, the research arm of the Iranian President's office, and was titled "Report of the first hijab special meeting" in July 2014 in a PDF format.
On 2 February 2018, a poll conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) showed that a few Iranians agreed with "changing Iran's political system or relaxing strict Islamic law".
An independent survey by GAMAAN conducted in 2020 showed that 58% of Iranians did not believe in hijab altogether, and 72% were against compulsory hijab rules. Only 15% insisted on the legal obligation to wear it in public.
Iran is the only country in the world that requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf. For example, in January 2018, a Chinese female musician was humiliatingly veiled in the middle of her concert performance.
