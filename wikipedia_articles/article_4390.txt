The Roland Sound Canvas (Japanese: ローランド・サウンド・キャンバス, Hepburn: Rōrando Saundo Kyanbasu) lineup is a series of General MIDI (GM) based pulse-code modulation (PCM) sound modules and sound cards, primarily intended for computer music usage, created by Japanese manufacturer Roland Corporation. Some models include a serial or USB connection to a personal computer. 


== Products ==


=== Sound Canvas ===
The first Sound Canvas units (SC-55 and SB-55) were sold in the winter of 1991, in some cases also sold as "Edirol" rather than "Roland" as the brand name, mainly with the SC-88VL.


=== Sound Canvas Personal Computer Products ===

=== Sound Canvas and Keyboard ===

=== Studio Canvas ===

Studio Canvas was a series of PCM sound modules with built in audio interfaces (some models only) sold under both Edirol and Roland branding. The samples contained in the ROMs of these units do not in all cases mirror the original SC-7 / SC-55 GM/GS samples. GM2 is downward compatible with GM.


=== Virtual Sound Canvas ===

There is also the VSC, Virtual Sound Canvas, range of PC software which provide GM and GS
synthesis on Windows PCs. Many versions of Cakewalk's Sonar software came bundled with a copy of VSC, though from Sonar 4 onwards they ship with the improved TTS-1 softsynth, which Roland has sold previously through its Edirol subsidiary as the HyperCanvas.


=== Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth ===
Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth, included in instances of DirectX as an integral part of DirectMusic, and on Microsoft Windows since Windows 98, incorporates sounds from the Sound Canvas series licensed by Microsoft from Roland in 1996. A four-megabyte file, titled "GM.DLS", contains the sample set in DLS format. Under Windows 9x, Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth is available only if WDM-capable sound driver is installed.


=== Apple QuickTime Software Wavetable Synthesizer ===
In 1997, Apple licensed the complete Roland Sound Canvas instrument set and GS Format extensions for improved playback of MIDI music files in QuickTime 3.0. This replaced the limited set of instrument sounds licensed from Roland in QuickTime 2.x.


=== Discontinuation of Sound Canvas VA ===
In July 2024 Roland announced that it would not longer be supporting the Sound Canvas VA software from the Roland Cloud service. The Software would no longer be freely available starting September 1st of 2024.
