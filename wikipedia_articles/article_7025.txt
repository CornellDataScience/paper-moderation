Have Moicy! is a collaborative studio album by Michael Hurley, the Unholy Modal Rounders and Jeffrey Frederick & the Clamtones. It was released on January 1, 1976 by Rounder Records.
In 2011, Light in the Attic Records reissued Have Moicy! on vinyl. Although nominally credited to three different groups, the music is performed by an overlapping cast of musicians, with Hurley, Frederick, and Peter Stampfel alternating lead vocals with one track sung by Paul Presti.


== Reception ==
Robert Christgau of the Village Voice ranked it as his favorite album of 1976 in his ballot for Pazz & Jop. Later, he included it in his ballot for the 2020 edition of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and noted it as his household's most played album.
Mark Deming of AllMusic also reviewed the album positively, writing "Have Moicy! is as close to a masterpiece as a group of people this genially laid-back would ever be capable of creating."
