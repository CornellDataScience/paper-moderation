=== Development ===
The War of the Worlds was first announced in December 2015, with the BBC confirming production of the series in May 2017. The series was produced by Mammoth Screen for the BBC, co-produced with Creasun Media, in association with Red Square.
Writer Peter Harness expanded the role of the narrator's wife from the novel, stating "I think the clearest choice that I made from the start of this project was to give the male character a wife who had strength of character in her own right [...] It was very important to me to make the female character three-dimensional".
The three-part series was directed by Craig Viveiros and produced by Betsan Morris Evans. It was executive produced by Viveiros, Damien Timmer, Preethi Mavahalli and Peter Harness from Mammoth Screen; Tommy Bulfin from the BBC; Minglu Ma from Creasun; and Jamie Brown from Red Square.
The interpretation makes use of time-shifting forwards and backwards in the narrative timeline in order to "upend audience expectations".


=== Filming ===
Filming began in April 2018 in Liverpool. Locations include St George's Plateau, Eldon Grove, Vauxhall (where an abandoned building was used as a London location), Sir Thomas Street, Dale Street, Ainsdale Woods, Delamere Forest, the village of Great Budworth in Cheshire, the Palm House at Sefton Park, and Croxteth Hall. Filming and post-production were completed by May 2019.

== Critical reception ==
The War of the Worlds has received mixed reviews from critics. The series holds a 68% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 critic reviews. The site's consensus reads, "Respectful, if not exactly riveting, Craig Viveiros' reimagined The War of the Worlds wandering narrative undermines its strong performances".
Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian gave the drama four stars, deeming it a "solid, reliable adaptation" of the source material which remained "thoroughly and entirely respectful" to the novel after the narrative alterations. She praised the score and the presentation of the "scale of the catastrophe", but criticised the plot's pacing – namely its slow start and use of flash-forwards – stating it had a "lack of urgency". Ed Cumming gave it three stars in The Independent, praising the set design and saying the leads do a "reasonable job" of portraying the relationship between their characters, but complained about its attempts to speak to contemporary political issues, stating, "The real war here is not between humans and aliens, but between a classic tale and the perceived liberal expectations of audiences in 2019".
In The Telegraph, Ed Power criticised it for appearing low-budget and for the relationship between the main characters taking precedence over the invasion, which was "presented almost as an afterthought". In other reviews from the paper, Anita Singh had similar thoughts, describing poor-quality visual effects and a lack of terror compared to the original. She said the characters had "understandably" been fleshed-out, but was critical of the "soppy love story" and of Spall's performance, giving the first two episodes two stars and one star respectively.
