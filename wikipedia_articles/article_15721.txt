== History ==
Irukandji (also known as Yirrgay, Yurrgay, Yirrgandji, Djabuganjdji and Yirgay) is a language of Far North Queensland, particularly the area around the Kuranda Range and Lower Barron River. The Irukandji language region includes the Cairns Region.
Smithfield was first established in 1876, and was a rival for dominance of the area to Cairns at that time. It was named in honour of prospector and explorer, William "Bill" Smith, who had a camp at this place. On Boxing Day 1877, Bill Smith added further notoriety to the town named after him by murdering a man and then shooting himself in the main street. After a devastating flooding of the Barron River on which the settlement was situated during a cyclone in March 1879, the original site was abandoned.
