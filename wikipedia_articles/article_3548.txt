== Club career ==


=== Bohemians ===
Born in Dublin, Ireland, Ward grew up in Portmarnock where he attended St Helen's Primary School and Portmarnock Community School. Ward played schoolboy football for Home Farm and Portmarnock before joining Dublin-based League of Ireland side Bohemians in the summer of 2003. He scored twice on his debut as a substitute against Skerries Town in the FAI Cup on 15 August 2003. Ward played as a forward for Bohemians before converting to a left-back. His form in Ireland attracted interest from various English sides including Sunderland and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The 2006 season with Bohemians ended up being his last and he made a total of 93 appearances for the club, scoring 26 times.


=== Wolverhampton Wanderers ===
After a successful trial, Ward joined English Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 2007 on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The fee, although undisclosed, was reported to be £100,000.
Ward had a bright start to English football scoring three times in his first six games, earning him the Championship Player of the Month Award for February 2007; his first goal came against Plymouth Argyle on 3 February. He featured in all of Wolves remaining 2006–07 fixtures as they reached the play-offs where they lost 4–2 on aggregate to Black Country rivals West Bromwich Albion. The next season was less successful for Ward as he was mostly used in an unfamiliar left midfield role, covering for the injured Matt Jarvis, but announced he was happy to play anywhere. Later on in the season, Ward himself also suffered injury woes as he was struck down with patellar tendinitis that ruled him out for four months. He played 31 times in 2007–08 as the team narrowly missed a second successive play-off spot finishing in 7th position.
The 2008–09 season again saw Ward adopt a new position as he was converted to a makeshift left-back, after George Elokobi sustained knee damage in only the third game of the campaign. Despite the emergency purchase of natural full back Matt Hill, Ward was often preferred in the spot anyway. Ward only missed four Championship matches helping Wolves win the title and earn promotion to the Premier League.
Ward began the club's return to the top flight in the left-back role, but he soon suffered a cartilage injury that kept him out of action for two months. Returning in December 2009 he was sent-off by Andre Marriner against Liverpool a decision which angered manager Mick McCarthy. Ward made a total of 22 league appearances in 2009–10 as the club managed to avoid an immediate return to the second tier, finishing in 15th. At the end of the campaign Ward signed a contract extension with Wolves.
During the 2010–11 season, Ward filled a variety of roles, playing left-back, left midfield and as a striker. One game up front saw him net his first Premier League goal, when he scored the only goal of the game against Liverpool at Anfield on 29 December 2010. He was part of the team that avoided relegation on the final day of the season as results went their way after a 3–2 defeat at home to Blackburn Rovers. Ward played 41 times in 2011–12 as Wolves suffered relegation to the Championship, finishing bottom of the table. Ward scored Wolves' first goal back in the Championship a 3–1 win against Barnsley on 20 August 2012. However Wolves would go on to have another poor campaign in 2012–13, suffering a second successive relegation.


==== Loan to Brighton & Hove Albion ====
After Wolves suffered a second consecutive relegation to enter League One in 2013, Ward was one of a group of players made available for transfer by the club's new head coach Kenny Jackett. On 16 August 2013, Ward was loaned to Brighton & Hove Albion for the 2013–14 season, where he made 47 appearances as the club reached the play-offs but were defeated at the semi-final stage by Derby County. Brighton then agreed to a permanent deal with Wolves for Ward over the close season, but interest from the Premier League halted the move.


=== Burnley ===

On 15 August 2014, Ward moved to newly promoted Premier League side Burnley, signing a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. Ward made only ten appearances for Burnley in 2014–15 due to injuries as the side suffered an immediate relegation. In 2015–16 Burnley went on a 23-unbeaten run which saw them gain promotion back to the Premier League as champions. Ward only missed one league match in 2016–17, playing a total of 38 times helping the Clarets avoid relegation, finishing in 16th position. Ward signed a contract extension in August 2017, keeping him contracted at Turf Moor until 2019. Ward scored in a 3–2 win away at champions Chelsea on the opening day of the 2017–18 season. Ward made 28 appearances as Burnley had a successful campaign finishing in 7th, qualifying for the UEFA Europa League. Ward lost his place in the side to Charlie Taylor in 2018–19, only making ten appearances. On 12 May 2019, it was confirmed he would leave Burnley at the end of his contract on 1 July 2019.


=== Stoke City ===
On 26 June 2019, Ward joined Stoke City, signing an initial one-year contract. Ward made his debut against Charlton Athletic on 10 August 2019 in a 3–1 defeat. Ward was in and out of the team in the first half of the 2019–20 season as Stoke were involved in a relegation fight. He picked up a calf injury against Fulham 29 December 2019 which ruled him out for four months. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the season was suspended for 15 weeks and extended into the summer and on 1 July 2020 Ward signed a contract extension to cover the remaining matches. After only playing once since the restart Ward left Stoke on 17 July 2020.


=== Ipswich Town ===
On 17 August 2020, Ward joined League One side Ipswich Town on a free transfer. He signed a one-year deal with the club, with the option of an additional one-year extension.
