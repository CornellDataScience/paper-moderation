The TA-57 is a Soviet-era field telephone. It is a completely analog battery-powered wired system that is highly resistant to electronic interception and jamming.


== History ==
The first model of the TA-57 rolled out in 1957 for usage by the Soviet Armed Forces.
As of 2022, the TA-57 was reported to be in use by Ukrainian forces in the Russo-Ukrainian War.
It has been documented in human rights reports as a torture device during the conflict, with euphemisms utilizing the TA-57 as a "phone call to Putin" or "call to Lenin".
In 2024, a leaked photograph showed one of the suspects accused of the 2024 Crocus City Hall attack being tortured by Russian FSB interrogators by having his genitals electrocuted by a TA-57.


== Description ==
The TA-57 can be used for induction calls working with 2-wire lines in an OB (local battery) or a ZB (central battery) operation. It can be used to transmit voice messaging in ranges between 0.3 and 3.4 kHz, with a calling frequency of 15 to 45 Hz. Absolute signal level at output of transmission path with a 600Ω load ranges between -3 and +3 dBu. It also a has a deployment time of 2 minutes.
Power is primarily drawn from a 10V lead–acid battery GB-U-1.3 (ГБ-10-У-1.3) with a capacity of 1.3 Ah, alternatively a 9V block battery can be utilized. In OB battery operation, a hand cranked magneto can be used to generate ringing.
The enclosing and body is made of Bakelite and its dimensions measure 22.2 x 16.5 x 7.9 cm, and weighs 2.8 kg.
There are multiple cables that are used, which can establish the range of the phone:

Field cable P-275 (П-275); 20 km range
Field cable P-274 (П-274); 40 km range
Field cable P-268 (П-268); 40–45 km range
Field cable P-271 (П-271); 125 km range
Overhead line; up to 170 km range.
With a reception amplifier, the signal range of the phone can increase by 30-50%.
It is intended for operation ranging from -40 °C to 50 °C, and a max humidity of 98% at 25 °C.
A modernized variant of it is known as a TA-57U.
