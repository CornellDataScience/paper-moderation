Kieran Marmion (born 11 February 1992) is an Irish rugby union player who primarily plays as a scrum-half. Marmion currently plays for English side Bristol Bears.
Marmion came into Connacht's academy through the Irish Exiles program and plays his club rugby with Galway Corinthians. Marmion has played his international rugby for Ireland since under-age level making his full debut in 2014.


== Early life ==
Marmion was born in Barking, England to an Irish father and English mother and was raised in Brecon, Wales. He is the son of former Saracens centre Mick Marmion. Marmion attended Christ College, Brecon, and Kirkham Grammar School where he was part of their successful rugby sevens team being a runner up at the Rosslyn Park Schools sevens. He was also a student at the University of Wales Institute Cardiff. Marmion was involved in the Irish Exiles set-up from a young age, and represented the Exiles at Under-18, Under-19 and Under-20 levels. This involvement with the Exiles led to Marmion being called up for the Ireland Under-20 team, which in turn led to him being signed to the academy of Connacht, one of the Irish provincial teams, in 2011.


== Career ==


=== Connacht ===
Marmion came to Connacht from the IRFU Exiles system, which helps Irish-qualified players overseas to make their way into professional rugby in Ireland. He made his Pro12 debut for Connacht on 1 September 2012 whilst still in the academy, starting against Cardiff Blues. Marmion then made his Heineken Cup debut on 13 October 2012, starting against Zebre in Connacht's 10–19 win, their first ever away win in the competition. Marmion signed a two-year contract with Connacht in November 2012. He was named as Connacht's Player of the Month for October 2012. In his first season with Connacht, Marmion started all 22 league games and all 6 Heineken Cup games.
Marmion scored his first try for Connacht on 28 September 2013, against Ospreys in the 2013–14 Pro12. Marmion again featured in all of Connacht's competitive games for the season, playing in the league and the 2013–14 Heineken Cup, with Pro12 matches against Benetton Treviso and Munster the only two games that he did not start in. Marmion signed a further contract extension with Connacht in November 2013, which will see him remain with the province until at least the summer of 2016.

Despite being raised in Wales, Marmion represents Ireland at international level, his parents being Irish, and Marmion having come through the Exiles. Marmion was capped at various under-age levels, including playing for the Under-18 and Under-20 teams.
