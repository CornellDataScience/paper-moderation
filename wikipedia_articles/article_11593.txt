The Jackson State Tigers football team represents Jackson State University in college football at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) level as a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC).
After joining the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) in 1958, the program exploded into national prominence. In the 1980s, the program enjoyed its greatest success. Under head coach W. C. Gorden, the Tigers won eight conference championships between 1980 and 1990, including four straight from 1985 to 1988.
Since 1958, Jackson State has won about 25 percent of the conference's football championships (19) and is a perennial powerhouse program among HBCUs. The Tigers have produced 101 professional football players and four Pro Football Hall of Famers: Lem Barney, Walter Payton, Robert Brazile, and Jackie Slater. Only 13 college football teams at any level have produced more Pro Football Hall of Famers than Jackson State.
In 2023 Tigers placekicker Leilani Armenta became the first woman to score in an HBCU Division I game, scoring three extra points in an October 29, 2023 game against the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.
