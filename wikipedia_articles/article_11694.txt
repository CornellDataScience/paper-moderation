Disco 3 is the third remix album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 3 February 2003 by Parlophone. The album consists of five remixes of songs and B-sides from their previous album, Release, three new tracks, a new recording of "Positive Role Model" from their 2001 musical Closer to Heaven, and a cover version of "Try It (I'm in Love with a Married Man)", originally by Oh Romeo, the band of former Pet Shop Boys producer Bobby Orlando. "Positive Role Model" also appeared on the Germany-only single "London" in 2002 as a B-side.
"If Looks Could Kill" and "Try It..." debuted during a 2002 Peel Session, along with "A Powerful Friend", a song that remained unreleased until it was uploaded to the "Exclusives Tracks" section of the band's official website. It was also released as the b-side to their 2010 single "Love Life".
