Anna Luisa Pignatelli della Leonessa dei Principi di Monteroduni  (born 22 November 1952, Asciano, Siena) is an Italian novelist and an aristocrat of German ancestry.


== Biography ==
Princess Anna Luisa Ermanna Pia Cecilia was born in Tuscany as the only daughter of Prince Wolf Georg Alfred of Schönburg-Waldenburg (1902-1983) and his wife, Countess Luciana Bargagli-Stoffi (1921-1984). She studied in Siena and graduated in Florence in Political Science. Married to a diplomat, Don Fabrizio Pignatelli della Leonessa dei Principi di Monteroduni (b. 1952), she has lived many years abroad, particular in South Korea, Tanzania, Portugal and for long periods in Guatemala where she played a significant role in the cultural life of the Italian community, has contributed with several articles to the local newspaper La Gazzetta and has organized cultural activities.


== Writings ==
In 1989 she started her writing production with a book dedicated to Guatemalan ethnic groups of Mayan descent, showing a strong interest in the culture of the local communities. Her maternal Tuscan roots emerge in the following novels L’ultimo feudo (2002), Buio (2006), Nero Toscano (2012) and Ruggine (2016), Foschia (2019), where the dominant themes are the attachment to the land and the ancestral values of her characters. The political and social situation of Guatemala is the main theme in the novel Le lac indigène (2012).
Her books are used in Italian literature and language courses at the Franklin & Marshall College of Lancaster (USA).


== Criticism ==
Antonio Tabucchi has judged her voice as unusual, lyrical, sharp, and desolate in the contemporary Italian literature, Rodolfo Tommasi has defined L’ultimo feudo as a masterpiece in contemporary fiction. About Nero Toscano (Noir Toscan) Elias Khoury wrote "It is a very beautiful book, a book of tenderness, written in a new perspective, in a language both dense and gentle. It establishes a magical relation with nature. This kind of relationship has always been essential in literature all over the world". Filippo La Porta ranked second her work Ruggine in the 2016 book list  and in Il Sole 24 ore he writes that "the art of being far from one's own time is what makes a text close to being a classic. This is the case of Ruggine". On Nero Toscano, Vincenzo Consolo writes: "This story of a southern farmer who settled in the tuscan countryside and fights alone for the preservation of nature, is an example of what everyone should do in defence of the environment and of the values we should all fight for". The french edition of the same novel, Noir Toscan, was presented by Vasco Graça Moura at the Foundation Gulbenkian in Paris in 2011. Her novels have been reviewed in numerous Italian and French newspapers and magazines: La Stampa, 23 Jan. 2016, Il Sole 24 ore, 7 Febbr. 2016, Corriere della Sera, 31 Jan. 2016, La Quinzaine littéraire, Oct. 2009, Le Monde, 31 Oct. 2009, Le Figaro littéraire, 19 Nov. 2009, Les Temps, 9 Dec. 2009, LaLibre.be, 4 Jan.2010, El Periodico, 19 Dec. 2014, Jornal de Letras, Artes e Ideias, 6 Apr. 2014, la Repubblica, 3 March 2019.
