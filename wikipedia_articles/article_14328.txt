== Reception ==

Billboard reviewed the album saying, "For the first time Crosby devotes his vast musical talent to only top country material. Demonstrating his feeling and understanding of lyric in such standouts as the classic “Four Walls” and “Jealous Heart.” Crosby maintains his own great style."
Variety liked it too. "The consistency of Bing Crosby’s talent over the decades is an authentic show biz phenomenon. In this set, the veteran singer finds himself in a very congenial groove with a group of backwoods ballads which he delivers with an easygoing lilt just tailored for this material."
BING magazine: “Without question, this new Crosby album has raised more comment than any other new release for many a year - never has my mailbag been filled with so much comment devoted to the latest record release…generally the album, except for the comment re Bing having a cold on some of the tracks, is being received with great enthusiasm all round.”
