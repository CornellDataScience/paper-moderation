== History ==
West Japanese-style soy sauce, called shoyu, has been a well-known condiment for over 300 years. Kikkoman is the largest shoyu manufacturing company in the world, and "the one most responsible for introducing shoyu to the West".
Founded contemporarily in 1917 in Noda, with the merger of eight family-owned companies.  Those companies were founded as early as 1603 by the Mogi and Takanashi families. Kikkoman was originally known as the "Noda Shoyu Corporation" before 1940, when they adopted a single nationwide brand name.

=== Soy sauce ===
Kikkoman soy sauce is produced using a traditional method of natural brewing. The process begins with soaking soybeans in water and then steaming them at high temperatures. These soybeans are mixed with crushed roasted wheat. Salt is added as an anti-bacterial agent and preservative. A type of the Aspergillus fungus is introduced to the mixture for three days to create shōyu koji, the base for the soy sauce. This base is then transferred to a tank and mixed with a saline solution, forming a mash known as moromi. The mixture undergoes several months of aging, allowing for various fermentation processes that develop the flavors. The moromi is mechanically pressed through fabric layers for about ten hours to extract the raw soy sauce.
The raw soy sauce is left to settle for 3–4 days and then pasteurized using steam, which stops enzymatic activity. The final product is then inspected and bottled. Kikkoman's soy sauce bottle was designed by Kenji Ekuan in 1961.


=== Soy milk ===
Kikkoman produces soy milk using selected soybeans and methods aimed at ensuring product freshness. The company offers a range of soymilk products. Kikkoman Soy milk is a leading brand in Japan and began expanding internationally in 2018, providing products to the Asia and Oceania regions.


=== Tomato juice and ketchup ===
Kikkoman started producing tomato juice and ketchup in 1962. The plant in Gunma focuses on tomato seasonings, while the Nagano plant specializes in beverages. In August 2013, Kikkoman launched the "Lycopene Rich" tomato ketchup, made with ripe tomatoes. This product line includes tomato sauce, puree, pizza sauce, and tomato beverages. The Nippon Del Monte Agri Company, established in 2013, focuses on the production and sales of fresh tomatoes and vegetable seedlings. The company has increased harvest yields by incorporating advanced technology from the Netherlands and optimizing farming methods for Japan.
