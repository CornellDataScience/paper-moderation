== Characters ==
Yuzu (柚)
Voiced by: Yuko Ōno (Japanese); Lindsay Seidel (English)
An innocent and loving foxgirl who has grown up with a nun, and just arrived at Konohanatei to expand her horizons. She has great respect for everyone around her, but takes a particular liking to Satsuki. A healing character, she brightens up the visitors' days.
Satsuki (皐)
Voiced by: Sawako Hata (Japanese); Dawn M. Bennett (English)
A serious-minded foxgirl and a bit of a workaholic. Deep down, she is quite sensitive, hoping to become a miko someday. Nevertheless, this only makes her work harder at Konohanatei to make up for her feelings of incompetence. She is quite fond of Yuzu, but not very good at showing it.
Natsume (棗)
Voiced by: Ayaka Suwa (Japanese); Emily Fajardo (English)
A tomboyish foxgirl that would easily pass as male. She has an exuberant and playful personality, but can be quite dedicated and courageous at times. She is quite protective of Ren, but gets along with everyone else.
Ren (蓮)
Voiced by: Risa Kubota (Japanese); Kate Oxley (English)
A feminine and perfectionistic foxgirl who seeks solace in being beautiful and performing well in her work. She is afraid of men due to childhood traumas of being bullied by them, but seems to see Natsume as her 'boyfriend' figure.
Sakura (櫻)
Voiced by: Ai Kakuma (Japanese); Jad Saxton (English)
A tiny foxgirl who is mysterious and idiosyncratic. Her thoughts are seldom known and she always seems to be doing weird, genius-like things. She spends some time with Yuzu since they're both the smallest, but secretly seems to trust Kiri the most.
Kiri (桐)
Voiced by: Manami Numakura (Japanese); Morgan Garrett (English)
A relaxed, older foxgirl who is the head of all the others. She appears to be laid-back but has an emotionally-intelligent side, seeming to have much experience in dealing with others and is secretly fond of Sakura and acts as her caretaker.
Okiku (お菊)
Voiced by: Akeno Watanabe (Japanese); Sarah Wiedenheft (English)
A "cursed" porcelain doll who ends up joining the Konohanatei after she is brought in for purification. She is often pestered by Sakura, who wants to cut her hair. She also mentions many times that her real name is not Okiku, but she has also never revealed her actual name.
Okami (女将, lit. "Landlady")
Voiced by: Megumi Ogata (Japanese); Linda Leonard (English)
The owner of Konohanatei who has the appearance of a fox but can look human by applying makeup. Her real name is Tsubaki (椿).
