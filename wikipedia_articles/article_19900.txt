This is a list of hybrid vehicles. A hybrid could theoretically have any two power sources, but hybrid vehicles have typically combined an internal combustion engine with a battery and electric motor(s).
This list includes both regular hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, in chronological order of first production. Since Porsche made the first hybrid car in 1899 there have been a number of hybrid vehicles; but there was a marked increase in interest in, and development of, hybrid vehicles for personal transport in the late 1990s.

=== Overview by decade ===


=== Early designs: 1899–1917 ===
1899: Carmaker Pieper of Belgium introduced a vehicle with an under-seat electric motor and a gasoline engine.  It used the internal combustion engine to charge its batteries at cruise speed and used both motors to accelerate or climb a hill. Auto-Mixte, also of Belgium, built vehicles from 1906 to 1912 under the Pieper patents.
1900: Ferdinand Porsche, then a young engineer at Jacob Lohner & Co. creates the first gasoline–electric hybrid vehicles.
1901: Jacob Lohner & Co. produces the first Lohner–Porsche, a series of gasoline–electric hybrid vehicles based on employee Ferdinand Porsche's novel drivetrain. These vehicles had a driveline that was either gas or electric, but not both at the same time.
1905 or sooner: Fischer Motor Vehicle Co., Hoboken, NJ produces and sells a petrol–electric omnibus in the United States and in London, including battery storage.
1907: AL (French car)
1917: Woods Dual Power Car had a driveline similar to the current GMC/Chevrolet Silverado hybrid pickup truck.
