== Overview ==
Amrita Singh, a young IPS officer, resigns fed up with political interference at work, opting to marry her longstanding beau in Canada. That's when she learns that her father Gursevak Singh, a Sikh himself, is a prime accused of 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Bokaro, Jharkhand.
Amrita decides to stay on in the police force to unravel the truth. Through Amrita’s investigation emerges a tender love story of trust, betrayal and supreme sacrifice, where we see a beautiful old-world romance of Rishi and Manu, a Hindu boy and a Sikh girl in 1984. As the story progresses, secrets from the past about identities and relationships come tumbling out one after another, while at the social-political canvas the situations in 1984 and 2016 present some chilling and uncanny similarities too.

It is based on the novel Chaurasi by Satya Vyas, which portrays the romantic relationship between two couples in the backdrop of 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Chandel stated that "I spend most of my time reading literature and poetry from all over the world and as a filmmaker, I want to tell stories of the characters who are rooted in Indian soil, and I connect with the stories where I find high emotional value." The pre-production for the series began in February 2020 but was put on hold due to COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India in March 2020, which was resumed after the lockdown. The principal photography of the series started in September 2020 at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh and filming completed on 4 December 2020.

Archika Khurana writing for The Times of India said, "Overall, 'Grahan' is an emotional tale that will leave you with a bag full of mixed emotions — love, hate, anguish, and betrayal. At times, it overwhelms too" and has rated 3.5 stars out of 5.
Shweta Keshri writing for India Today expressed, "the series might also interest the millennial kids in trying to find out about a forgotten chapter and one of the dark chapters of Indian history, which is not often talked about."
Sana Farzeen writing for The Indian Express said, "An impactful series that finds resonance in today’s India." Saibal Chatterjee writing for NDTV expressed, "Grahan, an essential cautionary tale, isn't eclipsed by its own unerringly earnest devices. Recommended for its humanist core."
