Tenpei Sato (佐藤 天平, Satō Tenpei) is a video game composer and voice actor. His most notable works are his soundtracks for Nippon Ichi Software games, such as Disgaea and Phantom Brave. He also provides voice-over for games and movies.


== Biography ==
Sato was born in 1967 in Kawagoe, Japan and grew up in Tokyo. He began playing piano at the age of six, and made his first composition, a piece for guitar, at the age of twelve. His first job was at Telenet Japan, where he composed the score for the action role-playing game XZR and popular side-scroller Valis II. After leaving Telenet, he joined Glodia, and together with Nobuhito Koise, composed the soundtrack to the cult classic Emerald Dragon. Later he would compose both Vain Dream with Abreath Nakamura and Bible Master II. After leaving Glodia, he joined Birdie Software, and produced soundtracks for four of their games.  He has since spent much of his career working with Nippon Ichi Software, which is where his music has gained its greatest recognition.  Games he has composed for include the Rhapsody series, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle: Tactics, and Phantom Brave.
A Nippon Ichi concert by the G-Dream 21 Ladies Orchestra was held on June 23 2024 in Ginza, Tokyo.  Sato composed the orchestral arrangements of his work and attended as a special guest.  In an interview, he commented that he was most looking forward to the orchestral arrangements of "Determination of a Little Princess" from the 1999 Rhapsody II, a fan favorite track, and "Kill Real" from the 2015 Disgaea 5, which required major revisions to make a chaotic vocal song work for an orchestra.


== Musical style and influence ==
Sato cites Queen, Claude Debussy, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Kate Bush as major musical influences.
