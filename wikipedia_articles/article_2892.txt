The 2015–16 season was the 133rd season in Bristol Rovers' history and their 88th in the Football League. Rovers returned to the Football League after an absence of just one season following their promotion from the Conference Premier via the play-offs.
For the second successive season, Rovers were promoted, the first time the club had achieved back to back promotions in its history. On a dramatic final day of the season in which Rovers required a win and other results to go in their favour, a 92nd-minute winner against Dagenham & Redbridge from Lee Brown sparked wild celebrations at the Memorial Stadium as the club returned to the third tier of English football for the first time in five years. Striker Matty Taylor ended the season as the top goalscorer in the top four divisions of the English football league system with 27 goals.
