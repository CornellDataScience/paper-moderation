Since inception, INTUC has been maintaining very close relationship with AICC. On several occasions there have been discussions over the relationship between INTUC and AICC and the need for having continuous dialogue between the two organisations on issues of mutual interests. In order to have regular interaction between the INTUC & AICC a five-member committee was appointed by the AICC in 1967 and Gulzarilal Nanda was the convener. Similarly during 2002, an advisory committee was formed under the chairmanship of Pranab Mukherjee. Three general secretaries represented AICC in the committee.  On behalf of INTUC, G.
