With his arrival in the lives of Milagros and Ramon, a cycle of endless and ruthless sufferings begin until these misfortunes are carried on to their daughters (Mira and Arriana) and to everyone they are bound to love. Their only chance to experience happiness and peace rests on the mending of the broken medallion. Don Lucio however, vows never to see the end of the curse on the Banals.
