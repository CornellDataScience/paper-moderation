Live from Abbey Road is a 12-part, one-hour performance series/documentary that began filming its first season during 2006 at Abbey Road Studios in London. Season 2 was filmed between 2007 and 2008, season 3 was filmed in 2009 and Season 4 was filmed in 2011. The series features a total of 128 musical artists to date (about 32 per Season) -- usually two or three per show, performing up to five songs per session.  The sessions are recorded without a live audience. Shot in HD video with the occasional use of 35 mm lenses, the producers have sought to record performances which "look like a movie and sound like a record".

== Production ==
Live from Abbey Road Limited is an independent production company formed by the series' producer, Michael Gleason. The series is produced under a multi year license from EMI, owner of Abbey Road Studios.
The second half of Season 4 aired in the UK from November 2011.


== Musicians ==
The series features famous musicians and groups from various genres, spanning from rock, heavy metal, electronic, pop and even jazz and blues. The artists featured spend much of the day at Abbey Road rehearsing and performing. Many have their own mixing desk and sound technicians on site. The idea is to capture the sound created during the production of a record, and to film the process without an audience, typical of the atmosphere in a recording studio.
