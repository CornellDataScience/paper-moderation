== Coaching career ==


=== Club career ===
Coleman was appointed as Head Coach of London Skolars on 18 March 2015, a position he held until the end of the 2021 season as cited at https://www.skolarsrl.com/2015/03/18/skolars-announce-former-player-jermaine-coleman-as-new-head-coach/
He took over at the London Broncos in the Championship following their move to Plough Lane ahead of their 2022 season.
Owner David Hughes claimed to have found the "ideal man" and that "he will use his knowledge of the lower divisions and part-time environments to help us create a strong group of players" as cited in https://www.loverugbyleague.com/post/new-london-coach-jermaine-coleman-wants-to-take-broncos-back-to-super-league
Thus Coleman recruited heavily from the lower leagues. He signed 13 players from London Skolars. Three were former Broncos players in Iliess Macani, Jordan Willams and Dalton Grant, whilst 38 year old Neil Thorman had Super League experience in the distant past. However Paulos Latu, Jacob Thomas, Will Ramsey, Rob Tuliatu, Adam Vranhos, Michael Greenhalgh, Judd Greenhalgh, Lameck Juma and Ronny Palumbo appeared to have only played in the third tier for the Skolars. Other signings like Dan Coates and reserve centre Jude Ferreira seemed also to have played in the lower leagues, as did the likes of Rian Horsman, Max Allen, Jack Howorth and Euan Parke.
London Broncos first game against Widnes with a weak third division standard side saw the Broncos conceding 3 times from the first 4 attacking sets, as cited at https://widnesvikings.co.uk/event/london-broncos-v-widnes-vikings/
By the end of his tenure, the Broncos were in the relegation zone, fielding the likes of 38 year old Halfback Neil Thorman and in very poor form; the team had managed just one win versus Dewsbury and one draw at Barrow from their league games under Coleman as cited at https://www.loverugbyleague.com/post/london-broncos-looking-for-new-full-time-head-coach-as-coleman-departs
He and his brother Jy-Mel were both sacked in May 2022.


=== International career ===
Coleman coached Jamaica for two games in 2016, beating Ireland in Dublin and drawing with Wales.
He is the secondary coach for Jamaica under Director of Rugby Romeo Monteith at the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.
