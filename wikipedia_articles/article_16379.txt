Grampian (Scottish Gaelic: Roinn a' Mhonaidh) was one of nine local government regions of Scotland. It was created in 1975 by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and took its name from the Grampian Mountains. The regional council was based in Aberdeen.
The region was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which divided the region into the three single-tier council areas of Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, and Moray.


== History ==
The Grampian region was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which created a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland. Grampian covered the combined area of four former counties, which were abolished for local government purposes at the same time:

Aberdeenshire
Aberdeen (which was a county of a city)
Kincardineshire
Moray (except Grantown-on-Spey and Cromdale, which went to Highland region)
Grampian was divided into five districts: City of Aberdeen, Banff and Buchan, Gordon, Kincardine and Deeside and Moray.
Grampian region was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary authorities. The region was divided into three single-tier council areas. The former City of Aberdeen and Moray districts each became council areas (although 'City of Aberdeen' was renamed 'Aberdeen City' to coincide with the reforms), and Banff and Buchan, Gordon, and Kincardine and Deeside merged into a new Aberdeenshire council area.


== Geography ==
The Grampian region was encompassed almost all of what could be considered the north-east of Scotland. 

Aberdeen was the major city of the region. Other major towns are the former royal burgh of Elgin, the major fishing port of Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Inverurie, Westhill, Stonehaven, Forres, Ellon and Portlethen. Grampian Regional Council was based at Woodhill House, Westburn Road, Aberdeen.

== Successor council areas ==


== Premises ==

The regional council was based at Woodhill House in the western suburbs of Aberdeen. The site had formerly been occupied by a large house, which had been bought by the old Aberdeenshire County Council in 1967. The new building was designed in 1971 to be a headquarters for the county council, to replace its old offices at County Buildings in the centre of Aberdeen. The possibility that local government reform may be coming was taken into account in the design of the building, which was completed and occupied in phases from early 1975 onwards. An official opening ceremony for the building was held in May 1977.
On the abolition of the regional council in 1996 the building passed to the new Aberdeenshire Council.
