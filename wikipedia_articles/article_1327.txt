== Reception ==
Cindy Lynn Speer of SF Site called Nobody Gets the Girl "very well written." The blog Guilded Earlobe gave Maxey's audiobook Bitterwood an A− rating. Bull Spec Magazine wrote, "James Maxey's Dragon Apocalypse series has been a lot of fun so far — and yet every time I say that I feel remiss in focusing on the fun, and not enough on how creative these books are." The book review website Founding Fields saying, "James Maxey is a freaking genius. I want more." George T. Dodds of SF Site wrote of Maxey's Dragonforge, "While I was entertained and the plot was compelling and well structured, the story left me feeling underwhelmed in a number of ways." Dodds expounded, "My biggest problem with Dragonforge is that the dragons are basically humans in dragon suits ... a bit more of Cthulhu-like incomprehensibility and alienness to their behaviour would have made them more interesting."
