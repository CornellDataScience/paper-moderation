Delta County Airport (IATA: ESC, ICAO: KESC, FAA LID: ESC) is a county-owned public-use airport located two nautical miles (3.7 km; 2.3 mi) southwest of the central business district of Escanaba, a city in Delta County, Michigan, United States. It offers limited commercial service, which is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.
It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021â€“2025, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.
The airport received $1 million from the US Department of Transportation in 2020 as part of the CARES Act to help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Airlines and destinations ==


=== Passenger ===

SkyWest Airlines operates flights on behalf of Delta Air Lines in Escanaba. The airport sees daily services both to Detroit and Minneapolis. The airline created controversy when, citing staffing shortages, it operated flights to Detroit as a "tag flight" with a stop in Pellston. These services only lasted one month, and the airline returned to nonstop flights. However, another change was announced in December 2022, when the airline announced plans to operate tag flights between Escanaba and Iron Mountain en route to one of their hubs.

== Accidents and incidents ==
On November 3, 2015, a Glimn Kitfox 2-3 impacted terrain while attempting a forced landing at Delta County Airport. The aircraft's propeller had stopped rotating inflight, but the engine was still producing enough power to remain in the air. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the aircraft owner's inadequate maintenance and servicing of the propeller gearbox, resulting in oil starvation, gearbox failure, and a subsequent loss of propeller thrust. A contributing failure was the aircraft's low altitude, which made it impossible to reach the runway in time. The private pilot in control, a prospective buyer of the aircraft, received minor injuries.
On August 2, 2018, a Gerald Dan Coppock homebuilt experimental aircraft sustained substantial damage during a runway excursion following loss of directional control while landing at Escanaba. The pilot, who was uninjured, reported the aircraft veered left once the tailwheel contacted the runway; both wingtips subsequently contacted the runway surface, and the airplane ground-looped. The right steering cable chain was later found to be broken and hanging out of the tailwheel, but it is undetermined whether the cable break occurred prior to or during the accident sequence.
