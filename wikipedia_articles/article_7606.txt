== Reception ==
The first two episodes of the show garnered 115,000 viewers.
The Sunday Age stated: "The relatively soft launch of this debut by Five Bedrooms screenwriter Mithila Gupta in this timeslot makes little sense". 
Sukhmani Khorana, a scholar of migrants' screen media and associate professor at UNSW Sydney, called it "not just an Indian-Australian love story... [but also] a closeted feminist coming-of-age tale", that would appeal to a diverse TV audience.
The Nightly called it "a great series that tells a specific but universal Australian story".
ScreenHub Australia gave it 4 out of 5 stars, calling it "compulsive viewing", "sharply observed and full of telling details when it comes to love", and "a well-written and eminently watchable modern love story".
