"After the Fire" is a song from the solo album Under a Raging Moon released by Roger Daltrey of The Who. The song was written by Pete Townshend, also of The Who. It was considered a hit for Daltrey, receiving extensive play on MTV. The song was played during the second season finale of Miami Vice during a flashback scene.
The song was originally planned to be played by The Who at Live Aid, and is about famine in Africa.  However the band committed last minute and was unable to rehearse the song, so it was given to Daltrey to record for Under a Raging Moon. Pete Townshend explains that it was specifically written for Live Aid and is comparing the situation in Africa as a fire, and that the concert would be figuratively putting it out. But despite this, it will always still “smolder and burn”.  
The recording was produced by Alan Shacklock and recorded at RAK Recording Studios and Odyssey Studios, London. The album Under a Raging Moon was released on the Atlantic label (81269-1) in the U.S. in 1985, and singles were also released in other countries in the same year.
Townshend performed the song live, as part of his 1985 Deep End concerts with David Gilmour on guitar.
