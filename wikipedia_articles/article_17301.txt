His father, Guy Maxwell, was an Indian trader and was adopted by the Seneca (Iroquois) in the same year. The senior Maxwell moved his family to Elmira (then Newtown Point), New York, in 1796. In 1804, he was adopted by the Seneca people, given the name He-je-no, meaning "the brave boy".

During the War of 1812, Guy Maxwell was appointed quartermaster of a regiment of Cavalry attached to the brigade of General Vincent Mathews.
After the war he served as clerk of Tioga County, New York from 1819 to 1829.

Eighty years after the formal adoption of Maxwell, his daughter Harriet (later known as Harriet Maxwell Converse) was formally adopted by the family of Red Jacket.
