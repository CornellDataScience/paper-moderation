Grand Prince Yeongchang (Korean: 영창대군; 12 April 1606 – 19 March 1614), personal name Yi Ui, was a Joseon royal prince as the only legitimate son of King Seonjo, from Queen Inmok who was born when his father was already 55 years old. Due to this, Yeonguijeong Yu Yeong-gyeong (유영경) once tried to select Yeongchang as the Crown Prince (왕세자; 王世子) to replace his older half-brother, Crown Prince Yi Hon, which eventually caused him to be unjustly executed after Hon's ascension to the throne. People often said that his sad life and death is equivalent to Chang of Goryeo.

=== Crown Prince's throne ===
He become Grand Prince Yeongchang (영창대군; 永昌大君) when he was 6 years old. His father, Seonjo was aware with the fact that Gwanghae had already become the Crown Prince (왕세자; 王世子), then secretly discussed with Yu Yeong-Gyeong (유영경) and some of his servants about censure of the Prince. Seonjo also made plans to change the crown prince when he was born, but it was destroyed. Meanwhile, Seonjo with specifically asked 7 people, including Han Jun-Gyeom (한준겸) to follow the Prince in order to protect him. This was called Yugyochilsin (유교칠신; 遺敎七臣; lit. Confucian Chilsin). Later, when Yi Yi-Cheom (이이첨) and Jeong In-Hong (정인홍) saw this, both of them argued that he shouldn't change the crown prince, but in fact, they went home and spreading unfounded rumors. When Seonjo suddenly died on 16 March 1608, Gwanghae, the Crown Prince took over the throne and then recruited them again.
Later, in 1613, Gyechukoksa (계축옥사) was made and Daebukpa (대북파) made a false confession to Bak Eung-Seo (박응서) and others of the conspiracy to elect the Prince and Kim Je-Nam (김제남), his maternal grandfather. The Prince was then abolished and exiled to Ganghwa-do. From July to November in the same year, Yang-sa (양사), Hongmungwan (홍문관; 弘文館) and Seungjeongwon (승정원; 承政院) alternately impeached them, but Gwanghae rejected they all.
In 1614, Yi Yi-Cheom's group ordered Ganghwabusa (강화부사; 江華府使) to Jeong-hang (정항; 鄭沆) and maliciously burned the Prince's room, also make him quit food. The young prince couldn't sit or lie on a hot floor day and night, grabbed a grate and cried. After this, Yi Yi-Cheom and Jeong-hang reported if the Prince died because of illness. At this time, he was still 7 years old.

In addition, public opinion appeared in favor to him and asked if he would have intention to conspiring against him. However, due to the continued appeals from Daebukpa (대북파), the Prince died in his exile place on 19 March 1614.
After his death, his half big brother, Prince Gyeongchang (경창군)'s 4th son, Prince Changseong (창성군) become his adopted son for continuing the House of Yi Royal Family's line. Then, on 15 March 1623, due to his nephew, King Injo's new reign, he was restored and his title was given back to him.
