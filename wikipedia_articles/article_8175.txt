The #SchoolsNotPrisons Tour is a free music and art tour that is partnering with California communities that have been impacted by the overuse of punishment and incarceration.
'#SchoolsNotPrisons Tour' promotes non-violence and activism by young people, it also encourages voting as a key way for communities committed to safety, justice, and peace to join in solidarity to make change. #SchoolsNotPrisons Tour focuses on the mass incarceration problem that is occurring in California, the state has been overspending on prisons under the mistaken idea that punishing and incarcerating people is what keeps communities safe which It doesn’t, it has only broken families and communities apart – especially communities of color, and it is taking opportunity away from our young people. Since 1980, California has built 22 prisons but just one UC campus, and in 2014, youth arrests outnumbered youth votes.
Tour partners and artists are standing up for a new vision of school and community safety centered on health, education, and investing in youth.
The 2016 #SchoolsNotPrisons Tour was produced by Revolve Impact, and supported by The California Endowment and The California Wellness Foundation.
