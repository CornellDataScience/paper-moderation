In 1998, she was nominated for Gawad Urian Best Supporting Actress in the movie Ligaya Ang Itawag Mo Sa Akin (1997) starring Rosanna Roces. Her memorable mother role was in the hit ABS-CBN's TV series Pangako Sa 'Yo (2000), where she played the adoptive mother of Kristine Hermosa.

=== 72nd FAMAS Controversy ===
In the 72nd FAMAS Award at the Fiesta Pavillon, Manila Hotel, Famas President, Francia Conrad apologized to Darren: "they were not able to “locate” her because they were “running a live show with myriads of people,” she said. Darren was tasked but failed to present Special Citations with Tirso Cruz III, after she received a notice of invitation for the FAMAS awards night", Fernando de la Pena, her son said. A "young singer" Sheena Palad replaced Darren, who paid P5,000 ($90) per plate for her 4 grandchildren. On May 28, Darren and her family decided to accept the olive branch of FAMAS organizers for the incomprehensible irresponsible snub. "Please stick to the script… and maybe a nice pair of eyeglasses for all in charge,” Darren's son Fernando recommended.
