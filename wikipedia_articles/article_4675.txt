The ninth federal electoral district of Oaxaca (Distrito electoral federal 09 de Oaxaca) is one of the 300 electoral districts into which Mexico is divided for elections to the federal Chamber of Deputies and one of 10 such districts in the state of Oaxaca.
It elects one deputy to the lower house of Congress for each three-year legislative period by means of the first-past-the-post system. Votes cast in the district also count towards the calculation of proportional representation ("plurinominal") deputies elected from the third region. 


== District territory ==
Under the 2022 districting plan, which is to be used for the 2024, 2027 and 2030 federal elections, the ninth district covers 42 municipalities in the state's coastal region.
The district's head town (cabecera distrital), where results from individual polling stations are gathered together and collated, is the resort city of Puerto Escondido in the district of Juquila.
With Indigenous and Afrodescendent inhabitants accounting for over 78% of its population, it is classified by the National Electoral Institute (INE) as an indigenous district.

2017–2022
Oaxaca's 11th district was dissolved in the 2017 redistricting process. Under the 2017 to 2022 scheme, the ninth district had its head town at the city of Puerto Escondido and it covered 42 municipalities.

2005–2017
Between 2005 and 2017, the ninth district comprised 60 municipalities and had its head town at the city of Santa Lucía del Camino in the Valles Centrales region.

1996–2005
Between 1996 and 2017, Oaxaca's seat allocation was increased to 11. Under the 1996 districting plan, the head town was moved to the city of Zimatlán de Álvarez in the west of the Valles Centrales region.

1978–1996
The districting scheme in force from 1978 to 1996 was the result of the 1977 electoral reforms, which increased the number of single-member seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 196 to 300. Under that plan, Oaxaca's seat allocation rose from nine to ten. The ninth district had its head town at Ejutla de Crespo in the state's Valles Centrales region.
