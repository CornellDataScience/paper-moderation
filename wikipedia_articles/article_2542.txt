== History ==
In 1989, Anne Heraty and Keith O'Malley founded Computer Placement Ltd. providing staff for the IT industry. In 1992, Heraty bought out the other shareholders, including O'Malley and became the 100% owner of CPL. In 1996, Heraty's husband Paul Carrol joined the company. Currently, he is the director of Business Development. In 1994, a restructuring of Computer Placement Ltd. started and from then on they used CPL mainly as a trade-name. The restructuring continued over the next few years and in 1996 the companies' CPL Engineering (construction) and CPL Solutions (IT/call centres) were founded. In 1997 the first new office opened in Limerick. In 1998, some new divisions were set up within Computer Placement Ltd: CPL Telecoms, CPL Sales and CPL Financial.
In July 2018, a Channel 4 investigation on Dispatches titled Inside Facebook: Secrets of a Social Network described CPL's role in providing content moderation services to Facebook through a team of employees who were instructed to allow certain types of graphic violence and hate speech to remain on Facebook. In March 2019, a former worker at CPL's Dublin location reported a high-pressure environment where moderators were required to evaluate videos containing graphic violence, child pornography, animal abuse, and other disturbing content with the expectation of meeting a 98% "quality rating".
