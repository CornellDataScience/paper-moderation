The Congress Secretary of Media said that Khushbu was being pressured by her husband, Sundar C, to join the BJP.

She used the term to highlight the use of foul language against women in a post on social media platform X while responding to a supporter of the DMK who accused her of staying silent during the Manipur ethnic violence on social media. In Tamil, the term refers to Dalit colonies that are separated from the rest of a village or town, and it is frequently used in a derogatory manner in reference to anything crude or crass. Her use of the term 'cheri' was condemned by activists for its caste-based connotations. The Neelam Foundation, an organization fighting for Dalit rights, demanded an unconditional apology. The Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi lodged a police complaint about her remarks. The Chennai city police increased security for Khushbu's house after the SC/ST wing of the Congress party announced a protest in front of her house. In her defence, she claimed that she had utilized the French term 'chéri', which translates to 'beloved', and not the Tamil word 'cheri'.

== Controversies ==


=== Accusations against IFFM, Melbourne ===
In August 2017, Khushbu accused Mitu Bhowmick Lange, the tender provider and director of Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) of discriminating against non-Hindi films and film stars.
Khushbu has been very vocal about getting more recognition for South Indian cinema, and the non-Hindi cinema from India on global platforms and film festivals. She has always maintained that Indian cinema is not just about Bollywood movies.
Sheba Nandkeolyar, and Rashi Kapoor Sharma (formerly known as Rashi Saxena/Pinka during her school days) of the Australia India Business Council (AIBC), conspired along with Mitu Bhowmick Lange of Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) to deny and block the invitation for Khushbu. This was done without even putting the resolution for any sort of voting from either of the AIBC Boards or discussions with broader AIBC members. Rashi and Sheba also denied AIBC membership and voting rights to dozens of applicants, including women and those from backward castes and tribes.
Sheba had unethically hidden her clear 'Conflict of Interest' by being the sponsor provider for the IFFM when blocking the invite for Khushbu. Meanwhile Rashi Kapoor Sharma (nee Saxena/Pinka/Motto) was later found accused in a real estate fraud in Melbourne along with her boyfriend Amit Miglani.


=== Opposition by Hindutva groups ===
Kushbu stirred controversy in December 2012 when she wore a saree that had images of the Hindu gods Rama, Krishna and Hanuman. The Hindu Makkal Katchi demanded an apology from her and threatened to start agitations. She responded by saying, "I am not going to answer every Tom, Dick and Harry. Why should I? There is no need at all. Why are they worried about what a woman sports. Don't they have any other worthwhile work?".
The Hindu Munnani and the Hindu Makkal Katchi filed several cases against Khushbu, accusing the actress of disrespecting Hindu gods by sitting cross-legged with her slippers in front of the idols of the goddesses Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Parvati during a puja for the muhurta in Chennai on 22 November 2007.


=== Maxim morphed photo case ===
In January 2006, in its first Indian edition, Maxim magazine featured a full-page composite photograph with her head pasted onto the body of a model wearing a bikini. Khushbu filed two complaints: defamation and the indecent representation of women against the editor and four others involved with the magazine. The proceedings were later stayed by the Madras High Court in December 2007 based on a plea filed by one of those charged.


=== Comments on pre-marital sex ===
In 2005, she said in an interview it was fine for girls to indulge in pre-marital sex if they safeguard themselves and took precautions to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Later, she justified her statement by saying no educated man could expect his partner to be a virgin. The Dalit Panthers of India stormed the office of the South India Film Artistes' Association in Chennai demanding an apology from her. The Pattali Makkal Katchi said it will protest outside her house.  22 complaints alleging that she was "defaming Tamil womanhood and chastity" were brought against her, but in 2010, the Supreme Court dismissed all cases.
