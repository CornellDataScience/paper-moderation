The Flenser (also known as Flenser Records) is an American record label founded by Jonathan Tuite in 2010 from San Francisco, California. It describes itself as a "dark music" label and a "dark experimental record label".
Notable bands that work with or have worked with The Flenser include Have a Nice Life, Deafheaven, Kayo Dot, Planning for Burial, Midwife, Chat Pile and Uboa. In 2019, The Flenser began publishing literature, with their first full-length novel, To Sing of Damnation, being released in 2020.


== History ==
The Flenser was founded in 2010 by former musician Jonathan Tuite in San Francisco, who originally intended to focus the label on the American black metal scene at the time. However, the scene began to wane in popularity as The Flenser slowly gained prominence, so Tuite expanded the reach of the label to other genres. The label was named after the process of flensing – removing blubber from whales – which Tuite learned about from the novel Moby-Dick.
The Flenser's first release was the album The Forgotten by Palace of Worms.
In 2014, the label re-issued Have a Nice Life's debut album Deathconsciousness, which had become a cult classic, and released their second album The Unnatural World.
In March 2019, the label held a two-night showcase in New York City headlined by Have a Nice Life with Planning for Burial, Wreck and Reference, Elizabeth Colour Wheel, Midwife, and Consumer. Another two-night event occurred in New York in April 2023 featuring Have a Nice Life, Giles Corey, Midwife, and Planning for Burial.
A Flenser showcase was planned for the 2020 edition of the Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the label, but it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was scheduled to be Giles Corey's debut live performance in Europe.
In 2020, the label released its first novel, To Sing of Damnation by Virginia author Adam Washington.
In March 2022, the label released Send the Pain Below, a six-song EP featuring multiple bands on the label covering nu metal songs.
The label hosted a showcase at the Oblivion Access festival in Austin, Texas in June 2023 featuring Have a Nice Life, Chat Pile, Planning for Burial, Mamaleek, Bosse de Nage, Drowse, Sprain, Ragana, Amulets, and Agriculture.
In 2024, the label will release Your Voice is Not Enough, a Low tribute album dedicated to the late Mimi Parker, the group's drummer, which was organized before her passing.
