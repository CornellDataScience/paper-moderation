The Sunset 4A Region is a part of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association and is one of two conferences in Southern Nevada 4A high school athletics. The Sunset Region consists of large schools in the western parts of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas and Pahrump, Nevada. There are two division in the Sunset 4A Region, Northwest and Southwest. The Sunset 4A Region was a part of the Southern Nevada 4-A Region, until the conference was divided into two separate regions due to the constant expansion and development of new high schools in the Las Vegas metro.
For the 2008–09 school year, the conference welcomed two new members, Pahrump Valley High School from Pahrump, Nevada who moved up from the class 3A and Desert Oasis High School which opened in southwest Las Vegas in the fall of 2008. Desert Oasis was an independent in football for the 2008 season before joining the Southwest Division as a full-time football member in 2009. They participate in the Southwest Division in all other sports. Pahrump Valley is a full member of the Southwest Division in all sports. Faith Lutheran High School moved from 3A to 4A at the beginning of the 2009–10 school year and is a member of the Northwest Division.
