On 18 September 2013 AirAsia X signed a shareholders agreement with Tassapon Bijleveld and Julpas Krueospon to establish a joint venture co-operation for a long-haul low-cost airline, a Thai company named Thai AirAsia X Company Limited was started in which AirAsia took a 49% share. Thai AirAsia X is the medium and long-haul operation of the brand Thai AirAsia. The franchise can keep costs down by using a common ticketing system, aircraft livery, employee uniforms, and management style.
On 3 February 2014 Thai AirAsia X received an Air Operators Certificate from the Department of Civil Aviation of Thailand which allowed the airline to apply for permits and slots for the intended routes. On 17 June 2014, Thai AirAsia X operated its first flight from Bangkok to Seoul with an Airbus A330-300. Following destinations were Osaka and Tokyo on 1 September 2014.
