== Background ==
On November 2, 2021, Post Malone and the Weeknd posted a 7-second snippet of the song titled "PM&TW-ORN-Update.5.nonhyped.w1.mp3" on their Instagram accounts. The post received over 150,000 likes in one hour. It was initially unknown what the title of the collaboration would be until Malone's manager Dre London revealed the title "One Right Now". The song marks the first time the artists appeared on a song together.


== Composition ==
Based on the teaser, the sound was described as "a synthy midtempo club track". It sees the two "harmonizing over an upbeat instrumental". Writing for Billboard, Starr Bowenbank referred to the instrumental as a "poppy synth beat". Alex Zidel of HotNewHipHop predicted that the song will "dominate the radio for the remainder of the year, and likely well into next". For the radio version, The Weeknd replaced his lyric censors from the official clean version with the newly recorded lyrics "You think it's so easy messin' with my feelings" and "You probably slap all my enemies". Post Malone left his lyric censors as they were. They both sang "That you told me that he fucked you on" twice, separate then together, and tying to Post Malone's record label, it was also left censored.


== Music video ==
The music video for "One Right Now", directed by Tanu Muino, was released on November 15, 2021. In the video, Malone and the Weeknd engage in a shootout with each other's teams. It features the two artists as "vengeful enemies" in an "elaborate scenario," according to Rolling Stone, that ends in a shoot-out where both are killed after shooting each other at the same time. The video also mentioned MoonPay, a cryptocurrency company that had paid Post Malone and The Weeknd for the placement.
