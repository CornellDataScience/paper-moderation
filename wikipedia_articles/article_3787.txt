The 1914 College Football All-America team is composed of college football players who were selected as All-Americans for the 1914 college football season. The only selectors for the 1914 season who have been recognized as "official" by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) are Walter Camp, whose selections were published in Collier's Weekly, and the International News Service (INS), a newswire founded by William Randolph Hearst.
Although not recognized by the NCAA, many other sports writers, newspapers, and coaches selected All-America teams in 1914.  They include Vanity Fair, Parke H. Davis, Walter Eckersall, The New York Globe, the New York Herald, the New York Evening Mail, the Atlanta Constitution, the Detroit Evening News, The Boston Post, and  The Philadelphia Inquirer.


== Overview ==
Harvard end Huntington Hardwick was the only player who was unanimously selected as a first-team All-American by all 27 selectors identified below.  Other players selected as a first-team All-American by a majority of the selectors were Harvard halfback Eddie Mahan (26 selections), Harvard guard Stan Pennock (26 selections), Princeton tackle Harold Ballin (22 selections), Michigan halfback John Maulbetsch (20 selections), Cornell quarterback Charley Barrett (19 selections), and Dartmouth guard Clarence Spears (16 selections).  The Los Angeles Times reported that "Maulbetsch, Michigan's hero, is about the only one of 1914's stars who received an almost unanimous vote."
The chart below reflects the number of polls in which the leading candidates (any player with at least two first-team All-American designations) were selected as first-team All-Americans.
