Judith is the tenth studio album by American singer and songwriter Judy Collins, released in 1975 by Elektra Records in both stereo (7E-1032) and CD-4 quadraphonic (EQ-1032) versions. Collins recorded Judith three years after her precedent album True Stories and Other Dreams, having been focused during the interim on producing Antonia: a Portrait of the Woman a documentary about Antonia Brico.
Peaking at No. 17 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, Judith became Collins' best-selling studio album to date: certified Gold by the RIAA in 1975, for sales of over 500,000 copies, Judith would be certified Platinum in 1996, for sales of over 1,000,000 copies.
Collins received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for her cover of Stephen Sondheim's "Send in the Clowns". Sondheim won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year that same year, based on the popularity of Collins' performance of the song on this album. The single peaked at No. 36 on Billboard's Pop singles chart in 1975, and then reentered the chart in 1977, reaching No. 19; it spent a total of 27 non-consecutive weeks on this chart.
The album also includes material by Steve Goodman, Danny O'Keefe, Wendy Waldman, Jimmy Webb, the Rolling Stones, and the 1930s standard "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?", as well as three of Collins' own compositions- "Houses", "Song for Duke", and "Born to the Breed".
