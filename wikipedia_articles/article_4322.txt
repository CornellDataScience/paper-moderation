=== Writing ===
Smith is the author, with Robert Allen Warrior (Osage), of Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee (1996). This account of American Indian activism "has already become a classic and essential interpretive work". The book focuses on three pivotal events in Native American activism, the 1969 Occupation of Alcatraz, the 1972 Trail of Broken Treaties to Washington, DC, and subsequent takeover of the Department of Interior headquarters, when the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) offices were occupied; and the 1973 Wounded Knee Occupation at Pine Ridge Reservation.
He put together his humorous but informative book, Everything You Know about Indians Is Wrong (2009), over 16 years. The book is described by its publisher, University of Minnesota Press, as essays that combine "memoir and commentary."


=== Other work ===
Smith has lectured at such institutions as the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC and the Getty Center in Los Angeles. He served as an academic advisor for the PBS series, We Shall Remain, Episode 5: Wounded Knee.
