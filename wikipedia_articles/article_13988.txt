== Professional career ==
Kiecker spent seven years in the minor leagues, having two double-digit win seasons in the A- and A level before finally getting promoted to Triple-A in 1988 with Pawtucket. He spent one further year there before making the 1990 roster out of spring training; he credited working with Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach in granting him confidence that he could make it with his stuff. The 29-year-old rookie made his first major league appearance against the Detroit Tigers on the road on April 12, appearing in the third inning. He went four innings and allowed three runs (two earned) on four hits. He made his first start on April 27 and went 4 1/3 innings while allowing four runs on four hits. He became a mainline starter in May. He won his first game on June 9, going six innings and allowing just one run. In 152 innings, he had a 3.97 ERA with 93 strikeouts to 54 walks with a record of 8-9 and pitched into the 6th inning in 19 of 25 starts.  That year, the Red Sox won the American League East and Kiecker was tasked to start Game 2 of the 1990 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics. Kiecker went 5 2/3 innings and allowed one run on six hits with a walk and two strikeouts while matched against Bob Welch. However, the bullpen could not hold its own against Oakland despite a 1-1 tie after six innings to give the Sox a 4-1 loss in a series later ended two games later. It would be the only postseason start by Kiecker. He was named Red Sox Rookie of the Year by the Boston Baseball Writers Association.
Kiecker was utilized in the bullpen for the Sox to start 1991, making just one start in April, which was a 5.1 inning effort (one run allowed) against the Royals on April 28. An inflamed muscle in his right elbow in May saw him miss June and most of July while rehabilitating for a couple games in Triple-A. He made just eight appearances in a major league game after May 26. His last start was on July 31, where he went five innings and allowed seven runs in a no decision. His last appearance in a game was on October 1, going two shutout relief innings. He went 2-3 on the year in 40.1 innings with 23 walks to 21 strikeouts and a 7.36 ERA He required  arthroscopic surgery after the season ended and ultimately never played again.
In 1992, Kiecker was released by the Boston Red Sox at the end of spring training.  He signed a minor league deal with Cleveland in 1992 but had a second arthroscopic surgery in November. He attended minor league spring training with the Minnesota Twins in 1993, before retiring due to continued elbow soreness. In a two-season career, Kiecker posted a 10-12 record with 114 strikeouts and a 4.68 ERA in 192.1 innings pitched.


== Post-baseball life ==
After retiring from professional baseball in 1993, Kiecker continued to play amateur baseball. In 1993, he turned down a contract offer from the independent St. Paul Saints. He would, however, go on to become a long-serving television analyst for the club.
