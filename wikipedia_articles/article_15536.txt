== History ==
Butterwick bus station was replaced by Hammersmith bus station in 1993. Butterwick Bus Station was demolished in late 1992 to make way for the new bus station. Route 667 used to terminate at the bus station and was operated from Fulwell bus garage.
In May 1937, a crowd gathered at Hammersmith bus station to watch the first route 11 bus leave after a strike lasting a month.

In 2004, Transport for London was successful in getting planning permission to extend the bus station. The extended bus station would include an information facility, cycle racks, and CCTV coverage. The new bus station's construction began in 2006 and the lower bus station opened in 2008. The road surrounding the new development was changed slightly, with a subway used to cross the road closed down. The extension was opened in February 2008.
In August 2011, Transport for London refurbished the southern end of the bus station. This refurbishment meant routes 9 and 10 had to move stops, and the closed bus stop was converted into a rest area for the bus station's staff.
Following the identification of structural weaknesses of Hammersmith Bridge in April 2019, routes across the river through Barnes have been suspended until further notice.
