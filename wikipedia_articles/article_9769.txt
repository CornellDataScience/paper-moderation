== Ecology and behavior ==


=== Voice ===
P. aurantiifrons vocalizations are described as a medium to low pitch of “hoo” followed by a seesaw (a series of alternative high and low notes). Each note of the “hoo” rises in tone. The seesaw pattern features six notes with the first, third, and fifth rising in pitch while the other notes descend. Additionally, P. aurantiifrons produce a sequence beginning with a single low note, followed by a louder series that gradually decreases in pitch.


=== Feeding ===

Moraceae (mulberry family), Combretaceae (white mangrove family), and Arecaceae (palm family) are included in the primary diet of P. aurantiifrons.


=== Breeding ===
Nesting takes place from the middle of the dry season to at least the early wet season; the breeding season is from September to April. The nest is sturdier than those typical of the genus and is positioned at a height of 2.4 to 4.6 meters in trees or shrubs. P. aurantiifrons lays a single white egg and does not incubate tightly.
