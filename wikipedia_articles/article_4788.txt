== Background ==
DJ Paul and Lord Infamous were in the process of rebirthing the Come With Me 2 Hell series when Lord Infamous decided that it would be better to try and reunite the old Three 6 Mafia instead. Gangsta Boo, Koopsta Knicca & Crunchy Black joined Paul and Infamous and reformed the old group under the new name Da Mafia 6ix. DJ Paul stated that he felt like it was a reunion, despite the absence of Juicy J. He thought of it rather as a whole new project, separate from Three 6 Mafia and decided to give the group a new name out of respect for Juicy J and to avoid potential complications involving the use of the Three 6 Mafia name without the approval of Juicy J and Columbia Records.
The mixtape was originally going to be called "Ressurlation", which was a meshing of the words Resurrection and Revelation, but was changed to "6ix Commandments" instead. The mixtape was deemed by DJ Paul a "sampler" for the upcoming album Watch What U Wish... by Da Mafia 6ix, which was scheduled to be released in 2014.
The track "Body Parts 4" is the final Posse Song to include verses from all 6 original members of Three 6 Mafia.
