Voorschoten '97 is a football and athletics club in Voorschoten, Netherlands.


== History ==
Voorschoten '97 was founded on 1 July 1997 after a fusion of the football clubs:  S.V Voorschoten, S.V.L.V and Randstad Sport.


=== Early history ===
V'97 can find its roots in 1925 when Voorschoten got its first official club, V.V.L. on 15 December 1925. Rouwcoop followed in 1932 and they shared De Burgemeester vd Hoeven Sportpark. V.V.L became known as S.V.L.V. Whilst Rouwcoop became Randstad Sport respectively.
Both these clubs would start senior 'Saturday' sides. There was some opposition because S.V.L.V had always been a 'Sunday' playing club.
In 1974 Randstad Sport moved to Sportpark Adegeest and there became intensive amalgamation talks of the two clubs, however time after time these talks broke down.
The 'Saturday' of Randstad Sport split as S.V Voorschoten in 1982.
In 1993 S.V.L.V were promoted for the first time in their history to the third division of the KNVB.


=== Amalgamation ===
Forced by economic emergencies to bring their strength together, but also encouraged by the council of Voorschoten, the 3 clubs came together in agreement. 
On the first of July 1996 Randstad Sport and S.V.L.V amalgamated. And exactly a year later, on 1 July 1997, S.V Voorschoten joined the party.
After 72-years Voorschoten would finally have a single club once more.


=== 1997 - Onwards ===
Roughly 1,500 members and 300 athletes, count towards the green-yellow family.
