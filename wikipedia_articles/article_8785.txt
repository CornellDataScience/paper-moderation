The Apokpa Marup is a religious institution dedicated to the practice and propagation of Apokpa Laining, a traditional Meitei religious concept. Founded on April 13, 1930, by Laininghan Naoriya Phulo, Apokpa Marup has played a significant role in reviving and preserving ancient Meetei religious traditions and cultural heritage. It was founded in the goal of reviving the suppressed old paganism of the Meitei ethnicity in the then Manipur.


== Origins and Founding ==
Apokpa Marup was established in response to the prevailing influence of Vaishnavism in Meetei society during the early 20th century. Laininghan Naoria Phulo, born on August 28, 1888, in Laishramkhun Mayai Leikai (now known as Rajyeswarpur-II), founded the institution with the primary goal of reviving the Apokpa Laining faith and fostering all-round development within the Meetei community.


== Philosophy and Beliefs ==
The core tenet of Apokpa Laining revolves around the worship of Apokpa, an equivalent to the divine concept of Brahman, or God. Unlike many other religious practices, Apokpa Laining does not involve the worship of idols or images. Instead, devotees arrange an altar known as Phamlen Phambaan, symbolizing the presence of the Almighty. The religious rituals emphasize the importance of the five elemental forces—fire, water, air, earth, and space—as integral aspects of the divine.


== Spread of Apokpa Laining ==
Apokpa Marup faced initial resistance and criticism for its divergence from prevailing religious norms. However, Laininghan Naoria Phulo's teachings gradually gained acceptance and followers. The institution played a crucial role in challenging orthodox beliefs and fostering a more inclusive and classless Meetei society.


== Institutional Structure ==
Laininghan Naoria Phulo established a governing body within Apokpa Marup known as "Ahan Taraanithoi," consisting of twelve superior devotees. This body discussed and decided on important matters related to the institution. The tradition of Ahan Taraanithoi continues to be followed, maintaining the principles set by Laininghan.


== Apokpa Marup Today ==
Apokpa Marup, headquartered in Laishramkhun, has been actively involved in religious, cultural, and educational activities. The institution focuses on the preservation of Meetei identity, language, and cultural practices. The followers of Apokpa Marup, known as Apokpa devotees, adhere to the teachings and principles outlined by Laininghan Naoria Phulo.


== Cultural Contributions ==
In addition to its religious significance, Apokpa Marup has contributed to the promotion of Meetei Yelhou Mayek, the ancient Meetei script. Laininghan emphasized the importance of using the mother tongue and preserving cultural traditions.


== Legacy ==
Laininghan Naoria Phulo's teachings on the eighteen guiding principles and the eight steps of discipline for attaining divine bliss continue to guide Apokpa devotees. The institution remains dedicated to fostering a harmonious and spiritually enriching way of life.
