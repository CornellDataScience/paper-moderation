== Early life and career ==
Snowdon was born in Canberra and was educated at St Edmund's College, the Australian National University and the University of Western Australia.
He worked as a teacher with the Northern Territory teaching service before entering politics. He was a senior project officer with the Central Land Council in Alice Springs 1983–87 and was founding president of the Central Australian Regional Trades and Labour Council, then assistant secretary of the Northern Territory Trades and Labour Council.


== Political career ==
Snowdon was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications 1990–92, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training 1992–96, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories 1993 and 1994–96 and Parliamentary Secretary (Territories) 1993–94.
Defeated at the 1996 federal election, Snowdon returned to parliament two years later. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Minister for Regional and Urban Development, Transport and Infrastructure (Northern Australia and the Territories) 2001–04. From 2004 to 2007 he was Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Northern Australia and Indigenous Affairs.
Snowdon was sworn in as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in the first Rudd ministry on 3 December 2007. Following a reshuffle of the Ministry on 9 June 2009 as a result of the resignation of the Defence Minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, Snowdon was promoted to Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery. On 14 September 2010, he gained the portfolio of Veterans' Affairs and regained Defence Science and Personnel, while losing responsibility for Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery, but retaining Indigenous Health. On 12 September 2011 he was given the added responsibility of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC.
Snowdon narrowly retained his seat at the 2013 federal election, largely due to his winning all but five booths. However, Snowdon was not appointed to the shadow ministry.
Snowdon was re-elected in the 2016 federal election with a seven-point swing towards him, becoming the longest-serving MP in the House, and the only member who was first elected in the 1980s. Snowdon was however not the Father of the House due to his continuous service only beginning from 1998. Kevin Andrews, whose continuous service began from 1991, became Father of the House instead. Snowdon again retained his seat at the 2019 federal election.
He sat on the "Inquiry into the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia" from June 2020.
In reference to his service from Old Parliament House, Snowdon said:
"I'm a bit of a relic. I'm the only one left in this parliament - Senate or House of Reps - from the Old Parliament House."
Snowdon did not contest the 2022 federal election and retired from politics.
