The Australian Association of Lyceum Clubs, formed in 1972 from several smaller clubs, is an Australian arts, literature and social activism group for women only.  The aim of the AALC is to promote a spirit of goodwill and understanding within the Association and to enhance the enjoyment of Lyceum by providing opportunities for contact and friendship with members of other Lyceum Clubs. The first Lyceum Club was founded in London, England in 1904 by Constance Smedley.
Ethel Osborne and Alice Maud Sewell founded a Lyceum Club in Melbourne after visiting the London club in 1910, and Ethel was elected vice-president during the first meeting on 21 March 1912.


== Member groups ==
There are several Lyceum clubs in Australia.

Adelaide, was formed in 1922 by Dr Helen Mayo. From 1924 to 1927 club rooms were in the upper floor of member Dr. Violet Plummer's home and consulting rooms at 222 North Terrace, then from 1927 the entire top floor and piazza of the Fada Building, 200 North Terrace. A feature was the elegantly furnished, 23 by 17 feet (7.0 by 5.2 m) "strangers' room". In 1934 a library was established.
They moved to larger premises in the CML building, King William Street, in 1936. Membership had grown from 43 to 244 in 16 years.
Present-day clubrooms are located at 111 Hutt Street with the Army and Navy Club.
