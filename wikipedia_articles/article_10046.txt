== Musical style ==
The lyrics for "Rasen no Yume" were written by vocalist Mao, as usual, and the music was composed by bassist Aki. The song was created especially for the anime, matching the story, after Mao read the manga. Aki said that a demo was already in preparation before being chosen as the anime's soundtrack, with a "normal" melody. After choosing, they rearranged the work and its melody to better fit the theme.
CD Journal website stated that the song has a "fast-paced melody" and "clear vocals". Real Sound said that the story of the song is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, as well as Altair: A Record of Battles, and addresses the emotions of the manga such as battles. Regarding the song, he called the drums "danceable" and the bass line "tight", saying that the song in general plays with "light strings" and mentioned the guitar solo at the end. The website also mentioned that "Rasen no Yume" has a unique pop style, matching the "charm" of visual kei. Ayumu Murase and Real Sound praised SID's ability (especially Mao's lyrics and Aki's composition) to faithfully express the anime's themes.
