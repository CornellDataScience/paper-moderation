a  The nationality column lists the player's national team or country of birth if the player has never competed internationally. The player's national team is listed if it differs from their country of birth. For example, Rob Zepp was born in Canada but has played for Germany internationally. His nationality is listed as Germany.
b The seasons column lists the first year of the season of the player's first game and the last year of the season of the player's last game. For example, a player who played one game in the 2014–15 season would be listed as playing with the team from 2014–2015, regardless of what calendar year the game occurred within.
