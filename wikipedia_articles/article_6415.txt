Bijele sige, also known as Bjele sige jama and Jama bijele sige,: 328  is a 27 m deep pit cave with horizontal extensions on the Medvednica massif.: 24  It is located in an area with many pit caves, but is one of the largest among these,: 26  and is distinguished by complex horizontal passages, which bring the total length of the cave to 94 m.: 27  The cave is under special protection, and is closed to the public.: 106 


== Description ==
The entrance to the cave is at 534 m above sea level, and its deepest point at 507 m above sea level.: 26  The entrance is narrow, at only 1.5×0.6 m, widening after 2 m until it becomes a chamber by the end of the 10 m drop.: 27 
The entrance chamber has a mound of soil, branches, and leaves at the bottom and extends both to the northeast and to the west consisting.: 28, 30 
To the northeast, the passage leads to a chamber with a small drop and smaller chimney above. This turns south and ends in narrow, impassable canal.: 27 
To the west, there is a side-passage to a pit with about 15 m of vertical elevation difference, most of which below the entrance to the pit.: 27, 30 


== History ==
The cave was explored and mapped on 18 May 1996 by the Speleološki klub "Željezničar",: 4  and again but with a 3D point cloud by a team from the Faculty of Science at the University of Zagreb in 2019–2020.: 9, 32 
Being near the city of Zagreb, the cave has been used for the training of vertical cavers in Single-rope technique, including on 7 November 1998, and again in the spring of 2000.: 82 


== Climatology ==
The average temperature in the cave is 9.8 °C (49.6 °F), with a relative humidity of 95% outside of the entrance chamber. No measurable airflow has been detected.: 29 
The maximum radon concentration is about 800 Bq/m3, which is much lower than some nearby caves.: 29, 34 


== Geology ==
Bijele sige formed in Middle Triassic layers. including limestone, marlstone, chert, tufa, and tufite.: 24, 27 
It formed away from fault lines and above the local erosional base as the result of denudation.: 38  It is under mainly hydrological conditions, as a vadose feature, although the cave is no longer hydrologically active today except through seepage. But two crevice systems are found in the cave: one 60-240° followed by the canal beneath the entrance, and one 10-190°. Both of these are nearly vertical. This has resulted in much of the cave having a triangular cross-section with a floor covered in eroded stones.: 24, 28 
The cave is decorated with speleothems, in places as thick as 3 cm, including stalactites, stalagmites, pillars, curtains, toothed curtains, cave pearls, tubular straws, moonmilk, cave popcorn, and other concretions.: 27  The decorations are so pervasive that they obscure the stratigraphy of the cave.: 28 


== Fauna ==
The woodlouse Mesoniscus graniger has been recorded in the cave.: 244
