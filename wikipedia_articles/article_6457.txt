German submarine U-1109 was a Type VIIC/41 U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II.
She was ordered on 2 April 1942, and was laid down on 20 October 1943, at Nordseewerke, Emden, as yard number 231. She was launched on 19 June 1944, and commissioned under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Hans Julius Hoß on 31 August 1944.


== Design ==
German Type VIIC/41 submarines were preceded by the heavier Type VIIC submarines. U-1109 had a displacement of 769 tonnes (757 long tons) when at the surface and 871 tonnes (857 long tons) while submerged. She had a total length of 67.10 m (220 ft 2 in), a pressure hull length of 50.50 m (165 ft 8 in), an overall beam of 6.20 m (20 ft 4 in), a height of 9.60 m (31 ft 6 in), and a draught of 4.74 m (15 ft 7 in). The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of 2,800 to 3,200 metric horsepower (2,060 to 2,350 kW; 2,760 to 3,160 shp) for use while surfaced, two SSW GU 343/38-8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 750 metric horsepower (550 kW; 740 shp) for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two 1.23 m (4 ft) propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres (750 ft).
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 17.7 knots (32.8 km/h; 20.4 mph) and a maximum submerged speed of 7.6 knots (14.1 km/h; 8.7 mph). When submerged, the boat could operate for 80 nautical miles (150 km; 92 mi) at 4 knots (7.4 km/h; 4.6 mph); when surfaced, she could travel 8,500 nautical miles (15,700 km; 9,800 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). U-1109 was fitted with five 53.3 cm (21 in) torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes or 26 TMA or TMB Naval mines, one 8.8 cm (3.46 in) SK C/35 naval gun, (220 rounds), one 3.7 cm (1.5 in) Flak M42 and two 2 cm (0.79 in) C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and fifty-two.


== Service history ==
U-1109 participated in two war patrols. Her first patrol was cut short, having left Kristiansand on 22 March 1945, she arrived in Bergen, 6 April 1945, having experienced technical problems on 2 April 1945. She did not damage or sink any enemy vessels. U-1109's second patrol also resulted in no ships sunk or damaged, departing Bergen on 17 April 1945.
On 12 May 1945, U-1109 surrendered at Loch Eriboll, Scotland. She was later transferred to Lisahally on 31 May 1945. Of the 156 U-boats that eventually surrendered to the Allied forces at the end of the war, U-1109 was one of 116 selected to take part in Operation Deadlight. U-1109 was towed out and sank on 6 January 1946, by torpedoes from the British submarine HMS Templar.
The wreck now lies at 55°49′N 08°31′W.
