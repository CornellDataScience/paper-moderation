Justin Dean Kluivert (born 5 May 1999) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a winger or forward for Premier League club Bournemouth and the Netherlands national team.
The son of former Dutch international football player Patrick Kluivert, and grandson of former Surinamese football player Kenneth Kluivert, Justin Kluivert began his career at Ajax, coming through the youth system. After playing for two seasons with the Dutch side, in 2018 Kluivert moved to Italian side Roma for €18.75 million. He also represented the Netherlands internationally, first at youth level from 2013, before making his senior debut in 2018.


== Club career ==


=== Ajax ===
Born in Amsterdam, Kluivert came through the AFC Ajax youth program, and had his first professional contract with Ajax. He made his Eerste Divisie debut with Jong Ajax on 16 September 2016 in a game against MVV, replacing Vince Gino Dekker in the 67th minute, in a 1–0 away loss. He also played in the 2016–17 UEFA Youth League, in which he scored in a 2–0 group stage win at PAOK on 2 November.
Kluivert made his first team debut in the Eredivisie on 15 January 2017 in a 1–3 away win against PEC Zwolle, when he replaced Amin Younes in the 39th minute. He scored his first Eredivisie goal on 19 March in an away match against SBV Excelsior, exactly 10 years and one day after his father's last career goal. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. He made six appearances in the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, and was an unused substitute in the final, a 2–0 loss to Manchester United in Stockholm.
On 26 November 2017, Kluivert opened his account for the season with a hat-trick in a 5–1 home win over Roda JC.


=== Roma ===

On 12 June 2018, Kluivert moved to Italian club Roma, following a telephone call made by Roma legend Francesco Totti to his father, for €18.75 million. He became the fifth Dutch player ever to represent the Italian side. Kluivert chose the number 34 shirt number at Roma as a support for his good friend and former teammate Abdelhak Nouri, who wore it at Ajax; Nouri suffered a career-ending cardiac arrhythmia attack in 2017.
Kluivert became the youngest Roma player to score in the UEFA Champions League after scoring the fourth goal in 5–0 home victory against Viktoria Plzeň on 3 October 2018. It was his first goal for the Giallorossi, and he dedicated it to Nouri. On 16 December, he scored for the first time in the Serie A in a 3–2 home win over Genoa.
For the 2019–20 season, Kluivert changed his shirt number to 99, representing the year he was born.

On 23 June 2023, Premier League club AFC Bournemouth announced the signing of Kluivert for an undisclosed fee, reported to be around €11 million + €1.5 million in add-ons. On 12 August, he made his debut for the club, as a substitute, in a 1–1 league draw at home to West Ham United.
On 1 November 2023, Kluivert scored his first goal for Bournemouth in a 2–1 loss to Liverpool in the fourth round of the EFL Cup. On 25 November, he scored his first Premier League goal, in a 3–1 victory away at Sheffield United. By doing so, Kluivert became just the third player, after Florin Răducioiu and Stevan Jovetić, to score in every Big Five league.
On 30 November 2024, Kluivert became the first player to score a hat-trick of penalties in a Premier League match, with three successful spot kicks as Bournemouth defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 4–2.
