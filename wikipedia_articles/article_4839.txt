East Central Indiana is a region in Indiana east of Indianapolis, Indiana, and borders the Ohio state line.  The Indiana Gas Boom, which took place during the 1890s, changed much of the area from small agricultural communities to larger cities with economies that included manufacturing.  Companies such as Ball Corporation and Overhead Door once had their headquarters in the region.  Glass manufacturing was the first industry to be widespread in the area, because of the natural gas.  As the glass industry faded, many of the skilled workers became employed at auto parts factories in cities such as Muncie and Anderson.  With the decline of the American automobile industry, East Central Indiana became part of the Rust Belt.  Many communities have been forced to reinvent themselves with a focus on services or a return to agriculture.
