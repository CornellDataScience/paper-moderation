Two of a Mind is an album recorded by American jazz saxophonists Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan featuring performances recorded in 1962 which were released on the RCA Victor label. The album is the second of two albums Mulligan and Desmond recorded in a pianoless quartet setting. The first, recorded in 1957, was Blues in Time (originally titled Gerry Mulligan - Paul Desmond Quartet).
The album's title track is a contrafact based on "Look for the Silver Lining".


== Reception ==

Allmusic awarded the album 4½ stars stating "Altoist Paul Desmond and baritonist Gerry Mulligan always made for a perfect team during their infrequent collaborations. Both of the saxophonists had immediately distinctive light tones, strong wits, and the ability to improvise melodically. ... the interplay between Desmond and Mulligan is consistently delightful. Highly recommended".
