In early 2013, Tokioka submitted HB 293 HD1 to establish Flavobacterium akiainvivens as the state microbe of Hawaiʻi.  At the time, no other U.S. states had a microorganism as a state symbol.  However, on 29 May 2013 Oregon officially designated Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the official microbe of the state, making it the first in the nation.
