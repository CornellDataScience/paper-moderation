== History ==
The village is in the ancient province of Rouergue.
The village was mentioned in the eleventh century when in 1070, Aicfred de Lévezou donated the village church of St Michel to St Victor's abbey in Marseille, so they could set up a priory. A spring was found in the crypt that had medicinal properties. A new church was built for the village. Arnaud de Lévezou was made bishop of Béziers in 1096 and then archbishop of Narbonne in 1112.  He had great influence with the papacy and became governor of Toulouse between 1119 and 1121. A new church was built for the village. This was time of the crusades, de Lévezou participated in the 2nd, 3rd and 7th.
In 1258, Bernard de Lévezou (Bishop of Bézier) granted privileges to the villagers while the priory was supported by the parishes of Castelnau, St Beauzély, Éstalane and Salsac.
On 3 May 1289 Bernard de Levezou and Hugues d'Arpajon fought a legal duel. Possession of Castelnau passed to the House of Arpajon, but Castelnau was not their main residence.
During the Arpajon period, the fortress saw peace and conflicts. The Hundred Years' War ended with the Treaty of Brétigny (1360), which gave Rouergue to the English (Les Anglais). Les Anglais was also the name used to describe roving brigands that roamed the countryside during this unstable period, Castelnau was protected by its ramparts.
During the Wars of Religion (1556–1632) the Arpajons of Castelnau became the warrior leaders of the Protestants. Millau was a Protestant stronghold.
In the 18th century, Louis XV created the Marquisat de Pégayrolles with Castelnau as its principal town. The marquis was Etienne Hypolite de Pegayrolles, President of the Parliament in Toulouse and the family moved into the chateau and turned it from a mediaeval fortress to a residential chateau and redecorating with trompe-l'œil paintings. The High Magistrate and "man of letters", Monsieur de Pegayrolles was known by his support of royal power against the Parliaments (1764), and against revolutionary power.
He joined the counter-revolutionaries; he founded a royalist club in Millau. He died in October 1794, a victim of the Terror's jails.
In April 1834, a royal prescription of Louis Philippe creates the commune of Castelnau such that it is today.
