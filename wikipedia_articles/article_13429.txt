The Pontiac City Hall and Fire Station is a historic building located at 110 W. Howard St. in Pontiac, Illinois, which served as both Pontiac's city hall and fire station. The building was constructed in 1900 to replace an 1883 building which also served as both a city hall and a fire station. Architect John H. Barnes designed the building in the Romanesque Revival style. Though built as a single building, the city hall and fire station are separated on the interior; a bell tower connects the two buildings. The building housed both Pontiac's city government and fire protection services until 1986.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 16, 1990.
