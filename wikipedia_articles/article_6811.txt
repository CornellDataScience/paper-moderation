The 2008â€“09 Ulster Rugby season was Ulster's 15th season since the advent of professionalism in rugby union, and their only full season under head coach Matt Williams.
David Humphreys, who retired at the end of last season, was appointed to the newly created role of operations director, reporting to chief executive Michael Reid. Peter Sharp joined as defence coach in August 2008. Current player Paul Steinmetz was appointed backs coach. Former Ulster players Jonny Bell and Niall Malone joined the academy as Elite Player Development Officers.
New signings included Humphreys' younger brother Ian, who had been playing for Leicester Tigers since 2005. Fijian winger Timoci Nagusa joined from Tailevu Knights.
Ulster finished third in their Heineken Cup pool, and eighth in the Celtic League. One highlight of an otherwise disappointing season was a win over Munster at Thomond Park in January, the first time Munster had lost at home in European competition. Three of Ulster's five tries came from Ian Humphreys' assists. Ulster qualified for next season's Heineken Cup as one of Ireland's top three teams, finishing ahead of Connacht in the league. Matt Williams left by mutual consent at the end of the season. Assistant coach Steve Williams also left after his contract was not renewed. For the following season, Ulster put a new management structure in place. Michael Reid was chief executive; David Humphreys was director of rugby, with overall responsibility for the senior team, the Ulster 'A' team (renamed the Ulster Ravens), the Ulster under-20s and the academy; and Brian McLaughlin was appointed head coach, assisted by forwards coaches Jeremy Davidson and Peter Sharp, and backs coach Neil Doak.
Rory Best was Ulster's Player of the Year, and flanker Stephen Ferris was selected for the 2009 British & Irish Lions tour to South Africa.
