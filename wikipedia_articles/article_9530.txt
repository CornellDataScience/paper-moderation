=== Budget ===
The 2011 budget was prepared by the president of the country and his executive committee. It was indeed a test of the unelected president who took over power due to the death of his predecessor Umaru Musa Yaradua, who died on 5 May 2010. The 2011 budget was the first budget that the Goodluck Jonathan administration has put together and the eyes of the entire nation are on his performance and capability, nonetheless. International organization such as the International Monetary Fund has also voiced their support with the Jonathan administration to reduce fiscal deficit for 2011 to 2013.
In December 2010, a budget of 4.236 trillion naira (18% less than 2010 budget) was prepared by the administration and was presented to the House of Representative on 15 December 2010. At the budget speech, the president of the federation called the budget; “a budget of fiscal consolidation inclusive economic growth and employment generation. The focus of this Administration is to establish and strengthen the sound macroeconomic environment that Nigeria needs to ensure the prosperity of our citizens”.


=== General election ===
A general election in 2011 is one of the events that the president has promised to deliver. He has promised a free and fair election. The election which took practically the entire month of April 2011 was credited by several international groups; the chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group commented on the election calling it, "a genuine celebration of democracy in Africa’s most populous country”.
Furthermore, the election brought a new era into the country’s history. For the first time a citizen from a minority region (South-South)of the country takes on the presidencial position after a successful election. The president (Dr Goodluck Jonathan) of the People's Democratic Party (Nigeria) (PDP) won the election as people came out massively to vote for him even in the South West part of the country. The South West region is majorly controlled by the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) party, one of the fastest growing political parties in the country. The success has also been accepted positively internationally in develop countries and by international investors. The general election opens several post election investment opportunities in the country.
