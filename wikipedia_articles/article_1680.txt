The Marsh Award for Children's Literature in Translation was a literary prize awarded in the United Kingdom from 1996 until 2017 to the translator of an outstanding work of fiction for young readers translated into English.
The award was given every two years and is sponsored by the Marsh Christian Trust.  The award was administered from 1996 by the National Centre for Research in Children's Literature at Roehampton University, and subsidised in its early years by the Arts Council of England. From 2008 the award was administered by the English-Speaking Union.
