The Runners are an American electronic and hip hop production duo from Orlando, Florida, consisting of Andrew "Dru Brett" Harr and Jermaine "Mayne Zane" Jackson. Formed in 2000, their foray into musical production was inspired by Timbaland and the Neptunes. Their trademark is an exhale sound effect echoing "Ahhh" at the beginning of their productions.
The duo first became known for their credits on the 2006 single "Hustlin'" by Rick Ross and the 2008 single "Go Hard" by DJ Khaled, and gained further recognition for their extensive work on releases for both artists. They have since produced songs for artists including  Keyshia Cole, Cher Lloyd, Ace Hood, Chris Brown, Fat Joe, Juelz Santana, Nelly, Kevin Gates, Jim Jones, Lil Wayne, Fabolous and Usher. Their production often accomplishes songwriting from Kevin Cossom or Rico Love, while they often work in tandem with fellow Florida-based producer acts DJ Nasty & LVM, the Monarch and Cubic Z.
