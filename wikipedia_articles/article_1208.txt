== History ==
Anschütz entered the target rifle market in the 1950s with the Model 54 action, releasing the SuperMatch by 1962. The combination of heavy receiver, short lock time and an excellent trigger almost immediately eliminated the Winchester Model 52 (known as the "King of the .22s" for the first half of the 20th century) from elite shooting and Olympic competition and positioned Anschütz as the premier brand for UIT/ISSF shooting in the second half of the 20th century.
The lighter-weight Model 64 receiver was released in the 1960s, aimed at sporter rifles. The 21st Century saw the release of early aluminium stocks, as well as the 2013 action which used a Match 54 bolt and trigger, but machined to a large rectangular footprint rather than cylindrical.
In 2015, the 54 action was updated to the 54.30, which shortened the bolt by 30mm. This was designed to compete with the short-bolt designs emerging from Bleiker and Grünig + Elmiger. However, features such as a 12-o'clock firing pin left it struggling to compete against newer designs such as the Grunig R3 and Walther KK500, which were outperformed the 54.30 in world class shooting - particularly in Prone events where decimal scoring was used.
At IWA 2023, Anschütz released the 22Max to compete at the top end of ISSF competition. The design represented a radical departure from previous bolt action rifles. Anschütz also announced a new product segment - the "Anschütz Precision Rifle" (APR). The APR segment launched with the 1761APR (rimfire) and 1782APR (centrefire), which used existing Anschütz barrelled actions modified for Precision Rifle Series style competition shooting. Anschütz partnered with MDT for the chassis.
