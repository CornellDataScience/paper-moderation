Later he was invited to another university in Yerevan, Armenia. From 2002 to May, 2018 he was Head of the Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Modeling, Russian-Armenian University. In January, 2007 he defenced his PhD thesis at the Specialized Council in Mathematics, YSU, and further on, in 2008 he qualified Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Modeling, RAU. In 2008 Garnik A.Karapetyan received the title of Distinguished Professor at RAU. He continued his research in the related sphere and in 2008 he got the certificate of Doctor of Physico-mathematical Sciences in the Russian Federation and the academic rank of Professor of the Russian Federation. From 2008 to  November, 2018 he was a member of the Scientific Council of RAU and that of Dissertation Council in Mathematics of the Republic of Armenia.
From 2015 to May, 2018 he was Deputy director of the Institute of Mathematics and High Technology of the same university. Later in 2015 to November, 2018 he also was Director of the Applied Mathematics and Informatics program, RAU. In 2017 Garnik A.Karapetyan was awarded an Anania Shirakatsi Medal.
