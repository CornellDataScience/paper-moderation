== Top 10 female journalist in Pakistan ==
On 8 March 2023, The Friday Times, a major newspaper in Pakistan published its 'List of Top Female Journalists in Pakistan'. Nasim Zehra was included in the list and reportedly was quoted as saying:

"With abiding power play and almost endless political chaos, being a journalist in Pakistan is like being on a roller coaster. It's a tough, trying but rewarding space to be in with self-scrutiny keeping you on your feet 24/7. We have to deal with the toxic fallout in this horribly mindless and polarised politics."
