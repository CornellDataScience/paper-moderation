The 1981 Chilean telethon was the fourth version of the solidarity campaign conducted in Chile, which took place on 11 and 12 December 1981. The theme of this version was "Together, Everything is Possible." The poster girl was Ana María Cortés.
For the fourth consecutive year Don Francisco conducted the telethon, which soon would become part of the history of Chile. This version was characterized by the number of artists who supported this cause. The amount raised was CL$ 202,436,220.
Among the controversies of this telethon, was the donation of an ambulance to that institution by the CNI (National Information Centre). According to the book La Era Ochentera (The Eighties Era), the telethon received a call from the CNI, to donate an ambulance, however Ximena Casarejos was not convinced that the CNI representative would make the donation. Eventually the CNI made the donation at 18:30 hours on 12 December 1981.
