The Northamptonshire Ironstone Railway  Trust operates a 1+1⁄2-mile (2.4 km) long heritage railway line at Hunsbury Hill, south-west of Northampton. The line is mainly dedicated to freight working, featuring many sharp curves and steep gradients which were typical of the industrial railway, but rides are available in a variety of vehicles including a converted brake van.


== Restoration ==
In the last few years the site has undergone restoration with 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) of line being regraded and relaid in 113 lb/yd (56.1 kg/m) rail and concrete sleepers, along with the restoration of 2 locomotives and brake van to enable passenger carrying as well as other restoration projects being undertaken. Operationally the railway has received full operating clearance from the HMRI to allow running on the relaid section of the 1st quarter of the mile of the route.
