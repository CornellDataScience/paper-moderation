== Career ==
Corbin was born Linsey Pickell to parents Tom and Betty in Greenbrae, California, and grew up in Bend, Oregon, where she attended Mountain View High School. Corbin participated downhill ski racing, cross country and track & field. She attended UC Davis where she ran track but eventually took a break from the sport while attending college. She transferred to the University of Montana to study nutrition and exercise physiology in 2000. In Montana, Corbin began competing in triathlon and in 2003 she entered Missoula's Grizzly Triathlon and won. Three years later she set a course record for her age group at the 2006 Wildflower Triathlon. She soon after turned pro.
In 2014, after living in Missoula and working with coach Matt Dixon of Purple Patch Fitness, Corbin made changes to her approach to training and season preparation. She moved back to her home town of Bend, Oregon for the opportunity to train around more elite athletes. She also switched coaches, to Jesse Kropelnicki of QT2 Systems. In 2015, Corbin planned to race at the Ironman African Championships in March, but she was unable to start after falling ill. Blood tests later revealed that she had contracted viral and bacterial infections. After some recovery time she took 10th place at the Ironman 70.3 North American Championship in St. George in May. She attempted to race the Ironman North American Championship later that month; however, a pulled hip flexor kept her from racing. Later tests would reveal that she had a small stress fracture in her femur. The injury and the recovery time needed to heal effectively ended her 2015 season causing her to miss the Ironman World Championship for the first time since 2005.
Corbin announced that the 2022 Ironman World Championship would be her final race as a professional.
