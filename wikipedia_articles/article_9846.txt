As a popular destination located near the Mall of America, Hyland receives 160,000 visitors per year. While Minnesota's winters are cold, the average snowfall is low for a ski area (less than 60 in.); due to this, there is often use of artificial snow to help maintain the viability of the slopes.

== History ==
In the 1950s, the Hyland Hills Ski Area was known as Mt. Normandale, with an annual attendance of around 48,000 skiers. After a snow drought of 6 years, the number of skiers dropped significantly. This caused Normandale to purchase a snowmaker and a sitzlift in an attempt to bring more skiers into the area. The owners, Gordy Bowen, and Oscar Strand found that this did little to help their business as the man-made snow settled into a hard mass and they did not have the grooming tools necessary to maintain the artificial snow.
Soon after Bowen and Strand's efforts, the Hennepin County Park Reserve District bought the area and renamed it to Hyland Hills Ski Area. With the addition of sophisticated grooming equipment, a new set of buildings, and proper chairlifts, the Hyland Hills Ski Area regained its former popularity.


== Ski Clubs ==
Hyland is home to many different ski and snowboard clubs for a variety of ages and skill levels. Among these is Three Rivers Racing, an Alpine Skiing club for youth aged 6â€“21 that provides premier coaching for aspiring skiers and has trained racers who end up competing in national, World Cup, and Olympic level races.
