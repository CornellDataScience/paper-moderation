Aisome-gawa (藍染川, "Aisome River"), also known as Some-gawa (染川), is a Japanese Noh play. The libretto's author is unknown, but it was being performed as early as 1514. It is in present repertoires of two of the major Noh schools, Kanze and Konparu. The story concerns a former lover of the high priest of the Dazaifu Tenman-gū who travels to Kyūshū to see him, but is tricked by his jealous wife into committing suicide. The priest prays at his shrine, and the deity, Tenman-Tenjin, manifests and resurrects the lover. The play was modified early on because of disruption at performances. It influenced several later works of literature.
