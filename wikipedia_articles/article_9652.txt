== Geography ==

Bulcock Street is the central business district of the Caloundra urban centre.
In the south of the suburb is a headland (Deep Water Point at 26°48′34″S 153°08′05″E) and a sandy beach (Bulcock Beach at 26°48′25″S 153°07′55″E) which face the Coral Sea with the northern tip of Bribie Island about 200 metres (660 ft) away. Bulcock Beach is named after Robert Bulcock, who served in both the Queensland Legislative Assembly and the Queensland Legislative Council and was a resident of Caloundra in 1878.


== History ==
The suburb takes its name from the headland Caloundra Head (in the neighbouring suburb of Kings Beach), which in turn comes from the Kabi language words "kal/owen" meaning beech tree (Gmelina leichhardtii) and "dha" meaning place.
In 1883 the first allotments of land in Caloundra were advertised for public auction on 28 August 1883. The map states 'the land is of a sandstone nature, undulating and ridgy, heavily timbered with Gum, Bloodwood, Tea-tree and Oak'. A 1907 map shows several sections from George Street to Ernest St advertised for auction on 7 January 1907 by the Government Land Office.
404 allotments of 'Bulcock Estate' were advertised for auction on 16 August 1917 by Isle, Love and Co, auctioneers, with an edge of the Estate mapped as adjacent to Tripcony's store and the Tramway terminus.
In 1919, 29 subdivided allotments of 'Caloundra Heads Estate' were advertised to be auctioned on 20 December 1919 by Cameron Bros. in Brisbane. A map advertising the auction shows the majority of blocks were on Albert Street between King Street and King's Beach. Another undated map shows more blocks of this estate were advertised for auction on King Street towards Ernest Street.
Caloundra Provisional School opened on 8 March 1899 and became Caloundra State School on 1 June 1912.
