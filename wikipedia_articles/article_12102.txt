Hatchett graduated from Florida A&M University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1954. He served in the United States Army as a lieutenant from 1954 to 1956. He graduated from Howard University School of Law with a Juris Doctor in 1959. He was in the private practice of law in Daytona Beach from 1959 to 1966.

He was the first African American to serve as a Florida Supreme Court Justice, and the first successfully retained on the Florida Supreme Court in a statewide election.
