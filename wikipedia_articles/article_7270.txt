Miss Puerto Rico is a national title bestowed on the women representing Puerto Rico in international beauty pageants.
In 1987, Puerto Rico became the ninth nation to win the Big Three pageants of Miss Universe, Miss World, and Miss International. In 2019, Puerto Rico won Miss Earth, becoming the fourth nation to win the Big Four pageants. Having also won Miss Supranational, Miss Grand International, and Miss Intercontinental by 2019, Puerto Rico became the first nation—and only one as of 7 December 2024—to win the Big Six or Grand Slam and the Big Seven pageants. 
As the second Ibero-American nation with the most titles in the Big Three, Big Four, Grand Slam, and Big Seven pageants, the fourth nation globally with the most titles in the Big Three, Big Four, and Big Seven, and the fifth nation globally in the Grand Slam, Puerto Rico, which has won 17 major titles as of 7 December 2024, is considered a powerhouse in beauty pageants, alongside Venezuela, United States, Philippines, and India.
In Puerto Rico, beauty queens are an important part of the culture. The businesswoman in the modeling and beauty industry in charge of many Puerto Rican representatives in international pageants between 1952 and 1998, Anna Santisteban, popularly known as the Hacedora de Reinas (Maker of Queens), is recognized as the figure who established the fervent enthusiasm for beauty queens in Puerto Rico. As the holder of the Miss Universe franchise in Puerto Rico, Santisteban produced three international winners, in 1970, 1985 and 1993.
Despite being a self-governed unincorporated U.S. territory with the title of commonwealth (Spanish: estado libre asociado, lit. 'free associated state'), Puerto Rico competes in international beauty competitions as a separate and independent nation from the United States since 1952, as it does in the Olympic Games since 1948 and the Pan American Games since 1955.

== Miss Universe ==


=== History ===
In its various forms, the Miss Puerto Rico beauty pageant has been held almost every year since the 1930s. The winner of the contest represents Puerto Rico at the Miss Universe pageant each year.
The selection of Miss Universe Puerto Rico commences the year before the winner advances to participate in the Miss Universe pageant. Each Puerto Rican municipality may choose a representative who then enters the Miss Puerto Rico finals, traditionally held at a San Juan area hotel. The winner is crowned at the conclusion of the final competition.
There have been  several changes to the pageant's ownership and name. Miss Puerto Rico was held from 1952 until 1998 under the direction of Anna Santisteban. From 1996 to 1998, Telemundo organized the contest under the name Miss Universe Puerto Rico. From 1999 to 2002, TeleOnce (now Univision Puerto Rico) obtained the franchise,  renaming it Miss Puerto Rico Universe. Magali Febles organized the pageant between 2003 and 2009 and the pageant title remained the same. In 2009, Luisito Vigoreaux and Desireé Lowry obtained the franchise and renamed the pageant Miss Universe Puerto Rico. In 2018, WAPA-TV obtained ownership of the franchise, keeping the name of Miss Universe Puerto Rico and hiring Denise Quiñones as the pageant’s director. In 2022, host, motivational speaker, Miss Puerto Rico Petite 2000 (national title), and Miss Global Petite 2000 (international title), Yizette Cifredo Hernández, became the new national director of the pageant.

Miss Intercontinental was held twice in 1991. Carmen Lynda Díaz from Puerto Rico won the first edition held in Lagos, Nigeria by Nigerian owners of the pageant, Silverbird Productions, which held the franchise from 1986 to 1991, and Elena Ivanova from Russia won the second edition held in Bonn, Germany by organizers working under the direction of the new owners of the pageant, a company from Germany, which held the competition in Europe from 1991 to 2003. Despite not being included in the official archive of the pageant by the current owners, Puerto Rico irrefutably won the first edition of 1991 in Nigeria, thus achieving its second Miss Intercontinental crown.
Having produced five winners as of 7 December 2024, Puerto Rico is the country with the most crowns, along Venezuela and United States, which have 5 winners each.
Since it began to be awarded in 2008, Puerto Rico is the country with the most Miss North America titles, winning it seven times as of 7 December 2024.
