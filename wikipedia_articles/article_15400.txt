Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America is an American food reality television series that premiered on June 6, 2012 on the Travel Channel. The program is hosted by actor and food enthusiast Adam Richman. In each episode, Richman samples what he considers to be the best sandwiches across the country, chooses a regional favorite, and then pits the winners against each other to find the nation's No. 1 sandwich.


== Premise ==
Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America features "one man's quest"—Adam Richman—to find the best thing since "sliced bread on sliced bread". Richman will sample the three most mouthwatering sandwiches in different regions across the United States, evaluate each one with his "B.I.T.E. Scale" (Bread, Interior, Taste, and Eating Experience) and then crown one sandwich "supreme". Each episode ends with Richman adding a send-off of the regional favorite sandwiches that got left behind. The weekly series featured eleven episodes (ten half-hour episodes with a one-hour finale).


=== Opening ===
The show opens with the following quote:

"The sandwich. I've sampled countless variations of this delectable and ingenious American icon. But one question remains. Which one is the best? To find out, I'm tasting my top three sandwiches in ten U.S. regions. I'll subject each sandwich to my trademark B.I.T.E. Scale. The one who rises above the rest will win the region and move on to the national championship for a chance to be crowned Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America".
