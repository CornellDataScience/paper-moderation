== Background ==
This was be the 27th appearance of the men's middleweight event. The event appeared at the first Olympic boxing tournament in 1904 and has been held at every Games with boxing (that is, excluding 1912) since. The middleweight class remains at the 69–75 kg range it has used since the 2004 Games.
The defending champion Hebert Conceição turned professional and did not participate, the 2020 silver medalist Oleksandr Khyzhniak won the competition, one of the 2020 bronze medalists, Eumir Marcial, lost to Turabek Khabibullaev, and another one, Gleb Bakshi did not participate since IOC barred the Russian Olympic Committee due to war in Ukraine.


== Qualification ==

Each NOC could send one boxer to the event.


== Competition format ==
Like all Olympic boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. The competition began with a preliminary round, where the number of competitors was reduced to 16, and concluded with a final. As there were fewer than 32 boxers in the competition, a number of boxers received a bye through the preliminary round. Both semi-final losers were awarded bronze medals.
Bouts consisted of three three-minute rounds with a one-minute break between rounds. A boxer may win by knockout or by points. Scoring was on the "10-point-must," with five judges scoring each round. Judges consider "number of blows landed on the target areas, domination of the bout, technique and tactical superiority and competitiveness." Each judge determined a winner for each round, who received 10 points for the round, and assigned the round's loser a number of points between seven and nine based on performance. The judge's scores for each round were added to give a total score for that judge. The boxer with the higher score from a majority of the judges was the winner.
