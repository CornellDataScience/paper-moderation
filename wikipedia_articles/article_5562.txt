The 2023 Ashford Borough Council election took place on 4 May 2023 to elect members of Ashford Borough Council in Kent, England. This was on the same day as other local elections in England.
At the previous election in 2019, the Conservatives had held onto a majority winning 26 seats out of the 47 up for election. In the intervening years a number of by-elections and defections caused the council to go into no overall control, with the Conservatives continuing to govern as a minority administration, led by Gerry Clarkson. He chose not to stand for re-election in 2023.
The council remained under no overall control following election. The Conservatives remained the largest party, but a coalition of the Ashford Independents and the Greens formed a minority administration, with Ashford Independent councillor Noel Ovenden being appointed leader of the council at the subsequent annual council meeting on 30 May 2023.
