There have been two baronetcies created for members of the Blackett family, both in the Baronetage of England. One creation is extant as of 2013. The Blackett family can be traced back to the Blacketts/Blakheveds of Woodcroft, County Durham, some of whom became highly successful in the lead and coal mining industries in Northumberland and County Durham.
The Blackett Baronetcy, of Newcastle in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 12 December 1673 for William Blackett, Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne.   Blackett was succeeded by his elder son, Edward, the second Baronet who represented Ripon and Northumberland in the House of Commons and built Newby Hall. William's third younger son William was created a baronet in his own right in 1685 (see below). The second Baronet's eldest surviving son, Edward, the third Baronet, was a captain in the Royal Navy. He died childless in 1756 and was succeeded by his nephew, Edward, the fourth Baronet, who was Member of Parliament for Northumberland and the son of John Blackett. The title thereafter descended from father to son until the death of Charles, the ninth Baronet, in 1968. Two of his younger brothers, George, the tenth Baronet, and Francis, the eleventh Baronet, both succeeded in the title. As of 2013 the title is held by the latter's eldest son, Hugh, the twelfth Baronet, who succeeded in 1995. Another member of the family to gain distinction was Henry Blackett (1867–1952), son of John Charles Blackett, fourth son of the fourth Baronet. He was an Admiral in the Royal Navy.
The family seat was Matfen Hall, Matfen, Northumberland, now a hotel and country club. It is now the nearby Halton Castle, Northumberland.
The Blackett Baronetcy, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 23 January 1685 for William Blackett, third son of the first Baronet of the 1673 creation. He sat as Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne. On his death the title passed to his son, William, the second Baronet. He also represented Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the House of Commons. Blackett had no legitimate issue and the title became extinct on his death in 1728. His illegitimate daughter Elizabeth married Sir Walter Calverley-Blackett, 2nd Baronet, who assumed the additional surname of Blackett (see Calverley-Blackett baronets for more information on this title).
