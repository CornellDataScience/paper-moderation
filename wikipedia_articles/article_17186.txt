The women's 200 metre breaststroke event at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held from 28 to 30 July 2021 at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. It was the event's twenty-third consecutive appearance, having been held at every edition since 1924.


== Summary ==
South Africa's Tatjana Schoenmaker came from behind to become her nation's first Olympic champion in this event since Penny Heyns in 1996. Trailing the U.S.' Lilly King at the halfway mark, Schoenmaker moved through the field in the penultimate lap. Almost half a second ahead of world record pace at the final turn, Schoenmaker closed strongly to become the first woman to break the 2:19 barrier and win gold in a world record time of 2:18.95. 
King, a 100 m breaststroke specialist over the years, established an early lead out of lane 2. However, King could not hold off Schoenmaker's ferocious charge over the back-half and settled for silver in 2:19.92. Meanwhile, King's teammate Annie Lazor (2:20.84) had the fastest final lap in the field, edging out ROC's Evgeniia Chikunova (2:20.88) by four one-hundredths of a second to claim bronze. More than a second back, Schoenmaker's teammate Kaylene Corbett (2:22.06) took fifth, while 2016 Olympian Molly Renshaw of Great Britain (2:22.65) and her teammate Abbie Wood (2:23.72) placed sixth and seventh. Belgium's Fanny Lecluyse (2:24.57) rounded out the championship field.
