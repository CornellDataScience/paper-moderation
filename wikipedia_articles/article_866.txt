A Short History of Benin is a non-fiction book by Jacob Egharevba, first published in 1934 by the Church Mission Society Press in Lagos. The book offers a historical perspective on the Benin Empire, a pre-colonial African state now part of Nigeria. The book is an English version of the author's earlier work in Edo, Ekhere Vb' Itan Edo, which was published in 1933. The book explores the beginnings, culture, and political structure of the Benin Empire, as well as the events leading to its British invasion and Ovonramwen's exile in 1897. It also includes a chronology of the Obas (kings) of Benin from the 13th to the 20th century.
The book is considered one of the earliest works of indigenous African historiography, as it was written by a native of Benin who had access to oral traditions and written sources from both the local and European perspectives. The book is appreciated for its simplicity, clarity, and authenticity, as well as its contribution to the preservation and promotion of the Benin cultural heritage. However, the book has also been criticised for its inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and biases, especially in relation to the origin of the Benin people and their relationship with other ethnic groups, such as the Yoruba and the Itsekiri. The book has been revised and enlarged several times by the author, with the fourth and last edition published in 1968 by the Ibadan University Press.


== Background and publication ==
Jacob Egharevba began writing the history of Benin in the 1920s, using both oral and written sources. He was influenced by the works of European scholars, such as Henry Ling Roth, Dudley Kidd, and Thomas Hodgkin, who had written about the Benin art, culture, and history. He was also motivated by the desire to counter the negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Benin people that were propagated by some European writers and colonial officials.
Egharevba first wrote his history in Edo language, and titled it Ekhere Vb' Itan Edo. The book was published in 1933 by the Church Mission Society Press in Lagos. 
The book begins with the establishment of the kingdom, detailing the history of the rulers from the Eweka dynasty onwards. It offers an overview of rulers, Queen Mothers, Princesses, titleholders, and war commanders, and outlines chieftaincy institutions like the Edaikan (crown prince) and warfare. The book concludes with a discussion on the kingdom's future. The book is organised chronologically, with dates for some events derived from European and contemporary colonial records. Its periodisation is based on dynastic reigns. The book has been used as a textbook in some schools in Benin and Lagos. The book was published with the knowledge and editorial approval of Eweka II, and the materials were sourced from Benin royal court sources.
Egharevba later translated his book into English, titling it A Short History of Benin. He revised and expanded the content, adding more details and sources. The book was published in 1934 by the Church Mission Society Press in Lagos. The book was the first English-language history of Benin authored by a native.
Egharevba updated his book several times, incorporating new information and making corrections. He adjusted some of his views and interpretations, especially concerning the origin and migration of the Benin people and their relationships with the Yoruba and the Itsekiri. He self-published the second edition of this book in 1953. The third and fourth editions were released in 1960 and 1968 respectively, both by the Ibadan University Press. The fourth edition, the last one published during his lifetime, is often referred to as the definitive version of his book. The book has been reprinted multiple times by different publishers, both in Nigeria and overseas. Each edition differed; all were revised and expanded, with certain facts and details either omitted or supplemented with additional materials from unpublished and published sources. The book used extensive oral traditions to reconstruct the history of Benin and its neighbours. In later editions, Egharevba used European accounts and oral sources to establish a timeline. This timeline was considered generally acceptable, with parts of it corroborated by other writers and archaeological materials. The 1953 edition introduced the Hamitic hypothesis, suggesting an Egyptian origin for the Edo people. The relationship between Ife and Benin and the subordination of the histories of neighbouring groups to that of the Edo was a point of debate. Some Edo authors have since minimised Ife's leadership role. Also, some former vassals of Benin have presented new reconstructions of their own histories.


== Content and structure ==
The book's editions have variations in chapter numbers, with the fourth edition comprising 29 chapters, each focusing on a unique aspect or time period of Benin's history. Each edition of the book includes a catalogue of the Obas of Benin from the 13th to the 20th century, along with their estimated reign durations and notable achievements. The book also presents illustrations, maps, and photographs representing Benin's art and culture.
The book investigates diverse theories and traditions regarding the origin and migration of the Benin people, tracing their lineage from Egypt, Sudan, Nupe, and Ile-Ife. It also traces the development of the Benin kingship institution, from the Ogiso dynasty to the Oranmiyan interregnum to the Eweka dynasty.
The book outlines the founding and expansion of Benin City, the capital of the Benin Empire, by Oba Ewedo and Oba Eweka I. It also explains the inception and functions of some of the important titles and offices in the Benin political system, such as the Uzama, the Eghaevbo, the Iwebo, the Ibiwe, and the Iweguae. It also mentions some of the significant festivals and ceremonies in Benin, such as the Igue, the Ugie Erha Oba, and the Ugie Oro.
The book includes an appendix where Egharevba provides supplementary details and clarifications on certain topics and terms mentioned in the book. This includes the roots and interpretations of specific Benin names, the inception and roles of certain Benin titles, the beginnings and importance of specific Benin festivals, and the establishment and organisation of certain Benin guilds.


== Reception and critique ==
The book has been widely referenced by scholars, students, and readers interested in the history of Benin and Africa. The book is noted for its clarity and authenticity, and its contribution to the preservation of the cultural heritage of Benin. The book is recognised as one of the early works of indigenous African historiography, written by a native of Benin who had access to both local oral traditions and written materials from local and European sources.
The book has also been critiqued for its inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and biases, particularly regarding the origins of the Benin people and their relations with other ethnic groups, such as the Yoruba and the Itsekiri. Some critics have noted the contradictions in Egharevba's views and interpretations, as well as the influences that affected his writing, such as European scholarship, colonial administration, and local politics. Some critics have also questioned some of the claims and evidence that Egharevba used to support his arguments, such as the Hamitic hypothesis, the Ile-Ife origin, and the burial of the Obas in Ile-Ife.
