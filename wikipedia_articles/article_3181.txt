Milecastle 3 (Ouseburn) was a milecastle of the Roman Hadrian's Wall.  No remains exist, but it was thought to have been located at the junction of the A187 Byker Bridge and Stephen Street.


== Construction ==
No evidence exists as to the configuration or type of Milecastle 3, though the curtain wall at this stage was almost certainly a narrow configuration.


== Excavations and investigations ==
1732 - Horsley surveyed the milecastle, recording its position.
1776 - The location was visited by Stukeley, who sketched the area for his Iter Boreale'.
1789 - Brand visited the site, but noted that many of the stones had been removed from the foundations some years previously, for use in the building of an adjoining house.
1848 - Collingwood Briuce reported that a small, partly illegible altar had been found close to the presumed site of the milecastle.  The altar (NMR Number: NZ 26 SE 227) was dedicated by Julius Maximus.  Having searched the area, he could find no trace of Roman remains.
1858 - Henry MacLauchlan surveyed the area but reported no dependable trace of the milecastle.
1928 - FG Simpson measured the distance from Milecastle 2 to Milecastle 3 as 1,450 yards (1,330 m).
1979 - Exploratory trenches were sunk during the building of the Metro, revealing no trace of the milecastle.


== Associated turrets ==
Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures.  These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison.  The turrets associated with Milecastle 3 are known as Turret 3A and Turret 3B.


=== Turret 3A ===
Nothing is known of Turret 3A and it was presumed to be located around 54.974892°N 1.596128°W﻿ / 54.974892; -1.596128﻿ (Turret 3A).  In September 2022 Pre-Construct Archaeology announced that they had located the turret at approximately 54°58′28″N 1°35′44.5″W, during surveys in advance of construction of student accommodation. Excavations found the walls of the turret in addition to a ditch and six obstacle pits.  Turret 3A became the most easterly known turret on the wall.  The turret was recorded as having a length of around 12 metres (39 ft) and foundations of 2.36–2.46 metres (7 ft 9 in – 8 ft 1 in) in width.  The interior of the turret is thought to have been truncated by late 19th or early 20th century construction work.  A Roman tegula tile was recovered, suggesting that the turret may have had a tiled roof.


=== Turret 3B ===
Nothing is known of Turret 3B.

Presumed location: 54.972217°N 1.602403°W﻿ / 54.972217; -1.602403﻿ (Turret 3B)
