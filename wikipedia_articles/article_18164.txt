Brock Alan Peterson (born November 20, 1983) is an American former professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals.


== Early life ==
During his childhood, Peterson played sandlot ball in his hometown of Chehalis, Washington and was considered a multi-sport athlete, participating in snowboarding, football, and wrestling. His favorite sport was basketball. Although he received some college interest in football at the end of his high school days, Peterson chose baseball after large improvements to his talents on the diamond. He was noticed by a former baseball scout, Bill Lohr, who began to provide advice for Peterson to improve his baseball skills. Despite helping lead W. F. West High School to two state semifinal appearances, Peterson received little attention from major colleges.

Peterson went on to play 165 games for the Bluefish, where he hit. 285 with 32 homers and 99 RBI thanks in part from the tutelage of his Bluefish manager, retired ballplayer Willie Upshaw.

After spending a decade in minor league and independent league baseball, Peterson was called up to the majors for the first time by the Cardinals on July 20, 2013, becoming the 20,469th player in Major League history.
