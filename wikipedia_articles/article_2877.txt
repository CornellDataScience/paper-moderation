Recently, residential remains from the Stone Age and the Mesolithic were found in Juam Dam (on the river Gapcheon) at Daejeon Village, Sasu-ri, Nam-myeon.
Bronze Age remains include 1,180 dolmens; and a variety of remains excavated in a stone-lines tomb at Daegok-ri (including National Tresture No. 143, bronze knife and bronze mirror). A pit-tomb from the Baekje Period was found at the site of Unjusa Temple.
