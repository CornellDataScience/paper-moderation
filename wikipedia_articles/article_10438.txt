The Hancorne (or Hancorn) family were a prominent landed family living chiefly in the English counties of Warwickshire and Herefordshire, and the Welsh counties of Breconshire and Glamorgan, between the Caroline era and the 19th century.


== Origin ==
According to family tradition, the Hancornes are descended from three brothers who fled to Britain from Spain to avoid religious persecution. D. H. H. Grainger suggested the family were of Marrano origin. A grant of arms was made to the family in 1627. The coat of arms includes three cocks, representing the three brothers, after which the village of Three Cocks in Breconshire is named.

The earliest known member of the most prominent line of the family was Thomas Hancorne (died 1644).
