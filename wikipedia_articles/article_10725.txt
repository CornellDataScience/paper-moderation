Gabriele Mandel (12 February 1924 in Bologna – 1 July 2010 in Milan) was an Italian islamist, psychologist, writer, and artist of Afghan descent. He was also known by the names of Gabriele Mandel Khān and Gabriele Sugana. He was also a Sufi guide (shaikh) in the Jerrahi Order.


== Early life and education ==
Mandel was the son of the Jewish writer Carlotta Rimini and the Sufi and historian Yusuf Roberto Mandel (of Turco-Afghan descent). His godfather was the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio. A Muslim, Mandel promoted interfaith dialogue and peace-building throughout his life.
In his youth Mandel studied music at the Conservatory of Vicenza, graduating in violin and harmony. After WWII (during which, along with his father, he was imprisoned and tortured by Nazis) he studied classical languages and literature and did extensive archaeological field research in India and in the Middle East, which he subsequently published. Later he developed scientific interests and graduated first in psychology and then as a medical doctor at the Faculty of Medicine of Pavia.


== Career ==
After the training he  began working as a psychotherapist, an activity that he continued during his life, in parallel with that of ceramist and writer. He wrote nearly two hundred books –many of which were translated into several languages- on subjects ranging from art history and calligraphy to Sufism. His ceramics have been exhibited throughout the world.


== Publications ==
He was the author of some 200 books published by major Italian presses (Rizzoli, Mondadori, Rusconi, Longanesi, Edizioni San Paolo, Franco Maria Ricci, Bompiani, etc.), many of which have been translated into several languages, including English.
