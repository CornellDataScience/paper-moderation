== The Blue Hole ==

The Blue Hole is an abandoned rock quarry that was used for nearby road fills and Henry Flagler's Overseas Railroad. The water it contains is mostly fresh and is used by various wildlife in the area, such as birds, snakes, alligators and invasive green iguanas. It is part of the National Key Deer Refuge.


== Business and commerce ==
The primary grocery store is located in a shopping center just north of US 1. This shopping center contains several restaurants, an outlet store, electronics store, the visitor center for the National Key Deer Refuge, and a branch of the Monroe County Library (with WiFi internet access). Pharmacies are located along US 1, as well as a shoe store, a tropical decor store, and a bait and tackle shop. A small hardware store in the same area sells typical paint, hardware, tools, other goods needed to build/repair items around the home, and a limited selection of parts for boat repair.
Several bars and restaurants are along the US 1 corridor. The nearest city of note is Marathon about 23 miles (37 km) "north" on US 1. Key West, a major shopping and cultural hub for the area, is about 30 miles (48 km) "south" on US 1.
Accommodation is limited, though RV/camping and a small number of motel-style units are available on the far southeast side of the island.


== Key deer ==

The island of Big Pine Key is home to the National Key Deer Refuge. The majority of the Key deer population are found on this island.
The Key deer is the smallest subspecies of white-tailed deer. The largest bucks are less than a yard high at the shoulders and weigh approximately 80 pounds. The does are 24 to 28 inches at the shoulders and weigh approximately 65 pounds. They have many habitats in the Florida Keys including pine rocklands, hardwood hammocks, mangroves, and freshwater wetlands. Key deer are only found from Big Pine Key to Sugarloaf Key.
As Key deer are endangered, many precautions have been taken to preserve as much Key deer habitat as possible:

Signs are prominently placed along US 1 to inform drivers that they are entering Key deer habitat, and warning them that feeding Key deer is prohibited.
About 2 miles of US 1 on the eastern end of Big Pine Key are elevated and fenced off to allow Key deer to pass under the road.
The stretch of US 1 in Big Pine Key has a night-time speed limit of 35 miles per hour (as Key deer are most active at night) and the speed limits (45 MPH in the day) are "strictly enforced" according to signage.
