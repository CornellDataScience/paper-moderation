== Views ==
In 2011 Healy made the case that Ronald Reagan was neither a neoconservative nor a libertarian. In 2013 Healy argued that wanting restraint in foreign policy is not "isolationist" and even stated, "...'isolationism' has always been a smear word designed to shut off debate. It was coined in the late 19th century by Alfred Thayer Mahan, 'an ardent militarist, who used the term to slur opponents of American imperialism.'" In 2014 Healy criticized Hillary Clinton's interventionist foreign policy, saying, "I think when you look at the totality of her record, it's very concerning. And if she realizes her lifelong dream in 2016 to become commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, she won't have to urge anyone to bomb. She'll be able to give those orders herself."
