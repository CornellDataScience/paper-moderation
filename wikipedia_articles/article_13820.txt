Walter Price (born 1989) is an American painter based in New York City. He is represented by Greene Naftali, David Zwirner, and The Modern Institute.


== Early life ==
Born and raised in Macon, Georgia, Price decided to become an artist in elementary school.
After he saw a photo of artist Jacob Lawrence wearing a sailor's uniform and standing next to one of his paintings, Price decided to enlist in the U.S. Navy. He served four years in the navy aboard the USS Whidbey Island. His military service enabled him to pursue his art education on the GI Bill.


== Career ==
Price's artistic practice often involves materials beyond acrylic or vinyl paint, as he incorporates fabric and photographs into his works. The paintings, often on wood panel, embody compositions that blur the line between abstraction and figuration.
