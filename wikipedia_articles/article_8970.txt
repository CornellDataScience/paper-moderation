== Personal life ==
McAdoo is an Evangelical Christian. He has spoken about his faith saying, "I just want people to realize I don’t play basketball for myself. No matter what adversities I face, how bad a season goes, or even how good a season goes, at the end of the day I’m playing for a bigger reason, and that’s to glorify my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
McAdoo's parents, Ronnie and Janet, both played basketball at Old Dominion in the late 1970s and the early 80s, and went on to play professionally in Europe, while his older sister Kelsey also played basketball at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Ronnie McAdoo is the second cousin of Hall of Fame basketball player Bob McAdoo, who played at North Carolina and in the NBA. McAdoo said that he calls Bob "uncle" although he does not know what their exact relationship is, and that "My dad's great-great-great grandfather and [Bob's] great-grandfather are like brothers."
On April 2, 2014, McAdoo married Lauren Elizabeth Adkins, a UNC volleyball player.
