He took a PhD in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh 1975-1978 with the thesis Procedural discourse generation model for 'Twenty Questions'.

== Selected works ==
His Comparative Eskimo Dictionary, co-authored with Steven Jacobson and Lawrence Kaplan, is the standard work in its area, as is his Comparative Chukotko-Kamchatkan Dictionary. In his book Pattern and Process, Fortescue explores the possibilities of a linguistic theory based on the philosophical theories of Alfred North Whitehead.
