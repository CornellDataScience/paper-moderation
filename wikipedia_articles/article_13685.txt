Warrior Rock: Toyah on Tour is a live album by the English new wave band Toyah, fronted by Toyah Willcox, released in 1982 by Safari Records.


== Background ==
The material was recorded on 17 and 18 July 1982 at London's Hammersmith Odeon at the end of the band's The Changeling UK tour. "Neon Womb" and "Street Creature", although performed during those shows, do not feature on the final album. There is no video counterpart to the audio recording as none of the concerts has been camera taped. The album was produced by Nick Tauber and the mixing took place at the Marquee Studios in London in August and September 1982.
The original double LP release of this album was the only Toyah record to be issued in a gatefold sleeve. It additionally contained an insert with Toyah's biographical discography. The album was released in early November 1982 and subsequently debuted and peaked at number 20 on the UK Albums Chart. It also reached number 1 on the UK Independent Albums Chart.
Warrior Rock: Toyah on Tour was re-released in CD format in February 2005. In May 2024, the album was re-released by Cherry Red Records. It included the full, unabridged version of the original double album, adding previously unreleased live recordings from other dates of the 1982 tour and rehearsals material.
