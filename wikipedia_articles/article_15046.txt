Transit First was an Australian bus company operating in the south-western suburbs of Sydney.


== History ==
Transit First's origins can be traced back to August 1982 when Peter Threlkeld purchased Holswothy Bus Co with 15 buses and services between Liverpool, Holswothy and East Hills adopting the trading name of Westway Bus & Coach Service. In July 1987 Milperra Bus Co was purchased with services between Milperra and Bankstown.
In January 1997 Westway purchased the routes 915 to 921 in the Auburn and Bankstown area from Crossley Bus Lines. In May 2003 Bankstown-Strathfield Bus Service and West Bankstown Bus Service were purchased from the Treuer family. In July 2003 the combined operation was rebranded as Transit First.
Due to the Sydney Metropolitan Bus Service Contracts that started in January 2005, some of the Baxter's Bus Lines were transferred to Connex and Transit First. In September 2006, the services that were transferred to Connex were eventually replaced by new services which were operated by Transit First.
In February 2007 Transit First was sold to Veolia Transport NSW.
