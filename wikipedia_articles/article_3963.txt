== History ==
Suszyna (then Dürrkunzendorf) was first mentioned in 1353 as "czu dorryn Cunczendorf" and in 1384 as "Dorrenkunzendorf". It belonged to the Wünschelburg District in Glatzerland, which was a sub-country of the Kingdom of Bohemia .
After the Silesian wars, Dürrkunzendorf became part of the County of Glatz in 1763 along with the Hubertusburger Frieden to Prussia. After the reorganization of Prussia in 1815, it belonged to the province of Silesia. In 1816-1853 the village belonged to the county of Glatz, and from 1854 to 1932 to the county of Neurode. After its dissolution in 1933, Dürrkunzendorf once again belonged to the district of Glatz. From 1874 it belonged to the district of Seifersdorf, along with the rural community Seifersdorf and several nearby agricultural estates.
As a consequence of the Second World War Dürrkunzendorf became part of Poland in 1945 and was renamed Suszyna. The German population was expelled in 1946. The newly settled inhabitants were partly brought from Eastern Poland.


== Demography ==
After World War 2, the native German population were expelled and were replaced by Poles from, according to data from 1947, the voivodships of Kraków (203 people), Lwów (83 people) and Tarnopol (66 people). The village lost its function as a resort. The airport and glider school were devastated. As a result, the village has now depopulated and is now mainly agricultural. According to the National Census (III 2011) it had 233 inhabitants.
