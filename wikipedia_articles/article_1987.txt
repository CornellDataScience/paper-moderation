Platinum Categorisation is a category within the FIA Drivers' Categorisation. The FIA Drivers' Categorisation is a system created by Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile that lists drivers on the basis of their achievements, performances and age. This categorization is used in sports car racing championships such as FIA World Endurance Championship, IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, European Le Mans Series, etc. The previously separate FIA WEC and FIA GT3 lists were merged in 2015. The initial categorisation is based on the driver's age and career record. Series that use FIA rankings must agree to submit the relevant data back to the FIA.


== Requirements for Platinum categorisation ==
Driver rankings are revised annually and issued in December.
Only the 2022 series names are listed in this summary; the historical equivalent series also count in most cases.  


=== General definition ===
Current or past FIA Super Licence holder, practice licences included.
Performances and achievements are at the Platinum driver level.
Professional driver


=== Competition results ===
Finishing on the podium in a Pro category in a major endurance race (24 Hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Daytona (DPi), 24 Hours of Spa, Nürburgring 24 Hours).
Top-five finisher in the general classification in the IndyCar Series, the Supercars Championship, the FIA Formula 2 Championship, Formula E, and any other FIA World Championship.
Winner of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in a Professional category (GTP).
Winning the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe, Asia and America, ADAC GT Masters and Pro category in a major endurance race would also result in an upgrade to Platinum.


=== Age ===
Drivers are reduced by one grade for the season following their 50th birthday (starting in 2023, age downgrades will start after the age of 55). Thus no driver over 50 may be categorised above Gold.


=== Discretionary ===
Drivers whose performances and achievements, despite not being covered by one of the definitions above, may be considered as Platinum by the FIA.


== Current drivers ==
This is the list as published on the FIA website at the beginning of the 2023 season, and includes 223 drivers, who hold the Platinum license.
