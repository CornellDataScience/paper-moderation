The Prix La Rochette is a Group 3 flat horse race in France open to two-year-old thoroughbreds. It is run at Longchamp over a distance of 1,400 metres (about 7 furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.


== History ==
The event was originally part of a series called the Prix Triennal. The first leg, the precursor of the modern version, was introduced in 1882. The second, for three-year-olds, began in 1883, and the third, for four-year-olds, in 1884. Each was restricted to horses owned by the breeder who foaled them. The races were initially held at Fontainebleau, and the juvenile division was contested over 1,100 metres.
The Prix Triennal was renamed in memory of Charles de La Rochette (1820–1889), a long-serving steward of the Société d'Encouragement, in 1889. It moved to Longchamp in 1892, and the two-year-old leg was cut to 1,000 metres. It reverted to 1,100 metres in 1893.
The series switched to Chantilly in 1906, and from this point the two and three-year-old parts were split into separate divisions for colts and fillies. They were abandoned during World War I, but substitutes were held at Maisons-Laffitte in 1918. The series returned to Longchamp in 1919, and to Chantilly in 1920. It was staged at Deauville in 1922, and on this occasion the juvenile legs were run over 1,000 metres. It resumed at Chantilly in 1923, and the split-race format continued until 1929.
The Prix La Rochette was cancelled three times during World War II, in 1939, 1940 and 1944. It was transferred to Longchamp with a new distance of 1,000 metres in 1941, and temporarily switched to Le Tremblay in 1943. In the post-war years it was usually held at Longchamp, but there were short periods at Chantilly (1947, 1,100 metres), Deauville (1955) and Chantilly again (1957–1959).
The distance of the race was progressively increased during the late 1960s. There were brief spells at 1,300 metres (1966–67), 1,400 metres (1968) and 1,500 metres (1969), before a sustained period over 1,600 metres began in 1970.
The Prix La Rochette was restricted to male horses from 1995 to 1999, and it was run at Chantilly from 1997 to 2000. It returned to Longchamp with a length of 1,400 metres in 2001.
