== Life and career ==
Ham was born in Sydney. From 1984 to 1998 he worked in London as a business and investment journalist for the Financial Times Group and The Sunday Times (as its investment editor, 1994–1998). In 1992 he co-founded a financial newsletter publishing company, whose titles included Governance and The Money Laundering Bulletin, which he sold in 1997. For part of that period Ham also worked part-time as the editor of Amnesty', the magazine of the British headquarters of Amnesty International. On his return to Australia in 1998, Ham was appointed the Australia correspondent for the London Sunday Times, a post he held for the next 15 years.
From 2000 to 2003 he wrote his first history, Kokoda – the story of the Kokoda Track campaign, the first land defeat of the Japanese in the Second World War; followed by Vietnam: The Australian War – a history of Australia's 15-year military involvement in Vietnam. Vietnam won the 2008 New South Wales Premier's History Award and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Awards for non-fiction; both Vietnam and Kokoda were shortlisted for the Walkley Award for Non-Fiction. His next book, Hiroshima Nagasaki, a controversial history of the atomic bomb, was shortlisted for the New South Wales Premier's History Awards, received an honorable mention in the Australian Prime Minister's Prize for History and was published to critical acclaim in the United States, Britain and Australia.
In 2010, Ham co-wrote and presented the documentary All the Way, produced by November Films in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), based on his history of the Vietnam War, which won the UN Media Peace Award. In 2008 he was involved in the production of a documentary based on Kokoda, produced by Pericles Films, the ABC and Screen Australia. In 2012, Ham set up an electronic publishing business called Hampress, which published short ebooks and classic audiobooks.
In 2013, Ham published 1914: The Year the World Ended in Britain and Australia, which won the Queensland Literary Award for non-fiction in 2014. His next book Sandakan: The Untold Story of the Sandakan Death Marches, was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Awards. In 2016–17, Penguin Random House published his books Passchendaele: Requiem for Doomed Youth and Young Hitler in Australia and Britain.
Ham was a regular contributor to Amazon's Kindle single platform, having published 1913, The Target Committee and, with the psychotherapist Bernie Brown, Honey, We Forgot the Kids, an examination of the state of families and childcare in the West.
Ham teaches narrative history at Sciences Po in France and has a master's degree in economic history from the London School of Economics and Political Science, a Bachelor of Arts (Communications) degree from Charles Sturt University and attended Scots College, Sydney. In his spare time, Ham organises an annual poetry recital, The Big Fat Poetry Pig-Out, the proceeds of which go to selected charities.
