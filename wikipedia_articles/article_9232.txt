The 2014 Tour of Oman was the fifth edition of the Tour of Oman cycling stage race. It was rated as a 2.HC event on the UCI Asia Tour, and was held from 18 to 23 February 2014, in Oman.
For the second year in a row, the race was won by Team Sky rider Chris Froome – becoming its first repeat winner – after he won the queen stage of the race, to Jebel Akhdar, on the penultimate day and held the race leader's red jersey to the finish, the next day, at the Matrah Corniche. Froome's winning margin over runner-up Tejay van Garderen of the BMC Racing Team was 26 seconds, and Omega Pharma–Quick-Step's Rigoberto Urán completed the podium, 5 seconds down on van Garderen and 31 seconds in arrears of Froome.
In the race's other classifications, André Greipel won the points classification for Lotto–Belisol, after winning three stages during the race, while the young rider classification was won by Romain Bardet (Ag2r–La Mondiale), as he was the best placed rider under the age of 25, in thirteenth overall. The combative classification – to which points from mountains and sprints were awarded towards – was won by Preben Van Hecke of the Topsport Vlaanderen–Baloise team, while Team Sky won the teams classification, after also placing Sergio Henao inside the top ten overall, as well as Froome.
