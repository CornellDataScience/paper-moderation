Adrien Leps scored his first aerial victories on 16 March 1917, downing an Albatros reconnaissance plane and another unidentified German two-seater. On 30 March, his award of the Légion d'honneur cited these wins. He next shot down an enemy fighter plane on 27 June 1917. A week later, on 4 July, Leps was promoted to Lieutenant.  He would score two more triumphs before year's end, sharing with Marcel A. Hugues and André Herbelin.
