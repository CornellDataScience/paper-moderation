Founded in 1485, Dumbarton Academy is a mixed secondary school in Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland.  


== Location ==
The school is situated near the railway off the B830 in the east of Dumbarton. St James Retail Park is on the opposite side of the North Clyde Line.


== History ==
Dumbarton Academy, which was originally based in the tower of Dumbarton Parish Church, dates back to the 15th century. It moved to a rented room in a building in the High Street known as "Walker's Close" in 1761 and to a new purpose-built building on the west side of Church Street, close to the corner with the High Street, in 1789. After that building was also found to be inadequate, a new combined burgh hall and academy was erected in Church Street in 1866 designed by William Leiper. The academy then moved to a site formerly occupied by Braehead House in Townend Road in August 1914, before being converted into a comprehensive school and relocating to Crosslet Road in Hartfield in 1972.


== Today ==
Today the school serves the catchment area of Dumbarton and currently has an enrollment of over 600 pupils. Alison Boyles is the head teacher.
The school received a positive report from the 2009 HMIE inspection.
The school currently operates a policy of inclusion with recent initiatives taken to increase the inclusion rate for less able pupils and decrease the rate of bullying in the school.
