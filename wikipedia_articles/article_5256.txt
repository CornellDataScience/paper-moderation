Nafiza Azad is a Fijian-Canadian young adult fiction fantasy author. Her debut novel, The Candle and the Flame, was released in 2019.


== Early life and education ==
Azad was born in Lautoka, Fiji. Opportunities to access reading materials were limited. Her hometown only contained one library, and readers could only borrow two books at a time, so Azad and her friends often made up stories for entertainment. In 2001, aged seventeen, she moved to Canada with her family. Azad entered the University of British Columbia in 2007, initially majoring in biology with the aim of becoming a doctor. However, she later elected to major in English instead, and to aspire to a career in writing. Her thesis consisted of a novel, which she claims to have written after a professor told her not to. Her thesis advisor was Maggie de Vries. Azad currently lives in Vancouver.


== Career ==
Azad's first work, The Candle and the Flame, was published by Scholastic in 2019. She credits American author G. Willow Wilson- who, like her, is both female and Muslim- as a major influence on her decision to pursue a writing career, stating that reading Wilson's novel Alif the Unseen made her feel “as though I had finally found a reflection […] I had a right to my own adventures”, subsequently inspiring her to write fiction of her own. Additionally, she cites S.A. Chakraborty's novel The City of Brass and Franny Billingsley's Chime as influences on the plot and writing style of The Candle and the Flame. As an author, she is represented by Katelyn Detwailer at Jill Grinberg Literary Management.
She is currently a co-founder of, and writer and administrator at Book Wars.
In addition, she has contributed to the YA anthology "Come on In". She is also the editor for the upcoming anthology Writing in Color: The Lessons We've Learned, set to be released in August 2023.

The novel is set in the fictional Silk Road city of Noor, in which humans and Djinn- supernatural spirits from Islamic folklore- live side by side. Its plot follows a young woman named Fatima, who is one of the sole survivors of a massacre that wiped out the city's original population, and who becomes entangled in the conflict between its human inhabitants, the Ifrit (a class of Djinn) and evil spirits known as the Shayateen. The city is inspired by and contains elements of South Asian and Middle Eastern cultures, with the novel containing words in Arabic, Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi.
