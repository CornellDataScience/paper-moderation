== Music and lyrics ==
The song is about honesty and faith in love, and features classic soul arrangements with trumpeter Roy Hargrove playing flugel horn. It features an interpolation of Kool & the Gang's "Sea of Tranquility" (1969). The song also has an arrangement of live guitar, bass and kick-drum, while D'Angelo's falsetto vocals contain spiritual highs and soulful lows. Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters wrote that the song "evokes the late '70s sounds of Angela Bofill ('I Try')." Another critic described the song's horn-driven sound as reminiscent of the work of Sam Cooke. 
On D'Angelo's vocal style on "Send It On", a Billboard magazine reviewer stated "In this musical setting, he sounds less like Prince (as he did on 'Untitled') and more like he's developing his own unique style-which bears the undeniable influence of Prince, Al Green, and Otis Redding." Entertainment Weekly's Matt Diehl called the song a "stately soul ballad like they just don't make anymore".
