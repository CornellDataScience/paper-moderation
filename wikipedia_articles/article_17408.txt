The first volume ran for six issues from December 2018 to June 2019, and a trade paperback collecting the series, subtitled The Evil Earth, was released the following month.
Two sequels followed: The Icarus Society (2022; illustrated by Matteo Buffagni) and Big Game (2023; illustrated by Pepe Larraz), with a further series, Slaves of Mars (2024; illustrated by Stefano Landini), to be published by Dark Horse Comics.
