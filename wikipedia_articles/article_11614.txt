In algebra and number theory, a distribution is a function on a system of finite sets into an abelian group which is analogous to an integral: it is thus the algebraic analogue of a distribution in the sense of generalised function.
The original examples of distributions occur, unnamed, as functions φ on Q/Z satisfying

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            r
            =
            0
          
          
            N
            −
            1
          
        
        ϕ
        
          (
          
            x
            +
            
              
                r
                N
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        ϕ
        (
        N
        x
        )
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{r=0}^{N-1}\phi \left(x+{\frac {r}{N}}\right)=\phi (Nx)\ .}
  

Such distributions are called ordinary distributions.  They also occur in p-adic integration theory in Iwasawa theory.
Let ... → Xn+1 → Xn → ... be a projective system of finite sets with surjections, indexed by the natural numbers, and let X be their projective limit.  We give each Xn the discrete topology, so that X is compact.  Let φ = (φn) be a family of functions on Xn taking values in an abelian group V and compatible with the projective system:

  
    
      
        w
        (
        m
        ,
        n
        )
        
          ∑
          
            y
            ↦
            x
          
        
        ϕ
        (
        y
        )
        =
        ϕ
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle w(m,n)\sum _{y\mapsto x}\phi (y)=\phi (x)}
  

for some weight function w.  The family φ is then a distribution on the projective system X.
A function f on X is "locally constant", or a "step function" if it factors through some Xn.  We can define an integral of a step function against φ as

  
    
      
        ∫
        f
        
        d
        ϕ
        =
        
          ∑
          
            x
            ∈
            
              X
              
                n
              
            
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
          ϕ
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int f\,d\phi =\sum _{x\in X_{n}}f(x)\phi _{n}(x)\ .}
  

The definition extends to more general projective systems, such as those indexed by the positive integers ordered by divisibility.  As an important special case consider the projective system Z/n‌Z indexed by positive integers ordered by divisibility.   We identify this with the system (1/n)Z/Z with limit Q/Z.
For x in R we let ⟨x⟩ denote the fractional part of x normalised to 0 ≤ ⟨x⟩ < 1, and let {x} denote the fractional part normalised to 0 < {x} ≤ 1.

    {\displaystyle \prod _{pb=a}g_{b}=g_{a}\ .}
  


== Universal distribution ==
One considers the distributions on Z with values in some abelian group V and seek the "universal" or most general distribution possible.


== Stickelberger distributions ==
Let h be an ordinary distribution on Q/Z taking values in a field F.  Let G(N) denote the multiplicative group of Z/N‌Z, and for any function f on G(N) we extend f to a function on Z/N‌Z by taking f to be zero off G(N).  Define an element of the group algebra F[G(N)] by

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            N

            a
            ∈
            G

            −
            1
          
        
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{N}(r)={\frac {1}{|G(N)|}}\sum _{a\in G(N)}h\left({\left\langle {\frac {ra}{N}}\right\rangle }\right)\sigma _{a}^{-1}\ .}
  

The group algebras form a projective system with limit X.  Then the functions gN form a distribution on Q/Z with values in X, the Stickelberger distribution associated with h.


== p-adic measures ==
Consider the special case when the value group V of a distribution φ on X takes values in a local field K, finite over Qp, or more generally, in a finite-dimensional
p-adic Banach space W over K, with valuation |·|.  We call φ a measure if |φ| is bounded on compact open subsets of X.  Let D be the ring of integers of K and L a lattice in W, that is, a free D-submodule of W with K⊗L = W.  Up to scaling a measure may be taken to have values in L.


=== Hecke operators and measures ===
Let D be a fixed integer prime to p and consider ZD, the limit of the system Z/pnD.  Consider any eigenfunction of the Hecke operator Tp with eigenvalue λp prime to p.  We describe a procedure for deriving a measure of ZD.
Fix an integer N prime to p and to D.  Let F be the D-module of all functions on rational numbers with denominator coprime to N.  For any prime l not dividing N we define the Hecke operator Tl by

  
    
      
        (
        
          T
