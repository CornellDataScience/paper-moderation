The Nissan RD engine series is basically a Nissan RB engine design, except that it is only a single overhead cam six-cylinder diesel engine. It was the successor to the Nissan LD and SD six-cylinder engines and was joined by the six-cylinder Nissan TD engine.
From 1997 onwards the turbocharged versions were fitted with electronic fuel injection. The turbodiesel version known as the RD28T (or RD28ET with electronic fuel injection) and were also fitted to the Nissan Safari (also known as the Nissan Patrol) off-road vehicle.
Since the Nissan RD engine is based on the Nissan RB engine, they have many similarities and many parts are interchangeable. The engine block was similar to the RB30 engine except it had more material, was heavier and had 85mm bore vs the 86mm bore of the RB30 and a 83mm stroke vs 85mm stroke. One issue is that the stronger vibrations from the diesel engine can loosen the crank/harmonic balancer bolt (originally from the RB engines) and in turn become loose or fall off causing major engine damage. It is recommended to use thread locking fluid when installing.
The cylinder head was of a non-crossflow design, meaning that the exhaust and intake ports were on one side of the cylinder head.
