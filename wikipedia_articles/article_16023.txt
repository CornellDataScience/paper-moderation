Parvēz,  Pērvaz, Parviz or Parvīs (Persian: پرویز—پرویز in Nastaliq, meaning "fortunate, victorious"; Middle Persian: plwyc Parvēz, also ʾplwyc Abarvēz/Aparvēz), is a Persian male given name, mostly popular in Iran, Central Asia, South Asia and among Azeris. It is also a common surname.
Parvēz, Parvez, Parvīz, Parwez, Parwiz, Pervaiz, Pervaz, Pervez, Perviz, Parvase, or Purvez are usually the same name but with different spellings. Furthermore, pronunciation between these different spellings are generally extremely similar or identical. All of these are ultimately derived from the Middle Persian name Feroz, of which 
there are many variations, such as Piruz, Phiroze, Feroze, etc.
