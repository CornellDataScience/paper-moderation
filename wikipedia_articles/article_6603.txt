== Toponymy ==
Leading specialist in Ukrainian onomastics, Doctor of Philology, Professor of Lviv University Mykhailo Khudash in his monograph "Origin of Ukrainian Carpathian and Carpathian names of settlements (anthroponymic formations)" noted that the original meaning was Shmaikivtsi, meaning 'family or subjects Shmaika'. That is, the original name of the village was Shmaikivtsi, which later grew into Shmankivka due to the pronunciation of the letter y changing to n. A direct analogue of this is the Ukrainian equivalent of the name Shmaiko.

=== Middle Ages and the modern day ===
In a multi-volume edition of records which were in the archives of the Bernardine monastery in Lviv, is the first known mention of the village Shmankivtsi. According to the act of 16 July 1449, which was registered in Terebovlia, Zimgund Kerdei received the above-mentioned village.
In 1469 there was a revision of the deeds of possession of property in Kievan Rus'.
According to the 1563–1564 tax register, an Orthodox church owned by Lanckoroński was recorded in Shmankivtsi.
On 29 September 1485, the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV Jagiellon issued a deed confirming the sale by Jan Freder of Pleszewicz to the Buczacki brothers of half the village of Shmankivtsi in Skal County on the Sarnek River for 200 hryvnias and two horses worth 50 hryvnias; the settlement was acquired by the Buczacki brother magnates of the coat of arms of Abdank.
In 1609, the Rus' voivode Stanisław Golski gave Marcin Makowiecki a folwark in Shmankivtsi, the smaller halves that Makowiecki occupied under the right of life from Mikołaj Buczacki.
On 22 February 1610, the Rus' voivode and bar elder Stanisław Golski, having invited the Dominican monks of Shmankivtsi, founded a Dominican monastery with a church called the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Stanislaus in Chortkiv. The monastery was allocated a large part of the village of Shmankivtsi with rates: the first, Mlynsky; the second, at the Court; the third, Stone; the fourth, Maciejewski; and the fifth, Demianovskyi. Stanislaw Liantskoronski from Brzez and Jan and Mykola Potocki from Potok also gave the monastery their units in this village. On 3 February 1622, the Dominicans received another piece of Shmankivtsi land as a gift from Jan and Mykola Potocki.
In 1623, Zofia of Brzez, wife of Mykola Churyl of Goraj, sister and heiress of the Podolsk voivode Stanislaw Liantskoronski, ceded her ancestral estates to the village of Shmankivtsi, smaller and larger, and Shvaikivtsi to Paweł Kełpiński and his heirs.
On 6 February 1624, a battle took place near Shmankivtsi between the Polish army under the command of Stanislaw Koniecpolski and the Tatar horde.
On 26 November 1624, Dominican monks from Chortkiv, together with Paweł Kełpiński, a neighbor of the village of Shmankivtsi, decided to build a castle here to defend against the Tatars, which in the next century was dismantled and the material was used to build walls around the church, monastery and garden in Chortkiv. In 1624, all the treasures from the Shmankivtsi monastery were transferred to Chortkiv.
In 1627, Paweł Kełpiński ceded his estates to the Łuków hunter Marcin Makowiecki. In 1644, Gabriel Kełpiński, son of Marcin, ceded his estates to Shmankivtsi, located in Kamianets County, Podil Voivodeship, which he inherited after the death of his brother Paul in its entirety and with all benefits, in favor of Krzysztof Kełpiński and his legal heirs; all processes on his part were released and the act of donation was confirmed by an oath. In 1653, Wacław Kełpiński, son of Stanisław and brother of Jan Kełpiński, his estates in the village of Shmankivtsi and other immovable and movable property, which he inherited from his father and mother and from his brother, were ceded to his cousins Adam and Felicjan Kełpiński. Claims for those estates were waived and the deed of gift was confirmed by an oath. In 1661, Adam, son of Gabriel Kełpiński, deeded his estates Shmankivtsi and Shmankivchyky, which remained after the death of his father Paweł Kełpiński, to Gabriel Silnitsky in Silnitsy, Lviv hunter and company commander.
On 26 July 1671, Ulrich von Werdum called the village Chernihiv; while here with a military convoy, he noted in his diary that "this village had a castle, which a few days ago, after a long defense, the Tatars stormed and killed all the people, not sparing women and children. The people of Verdum saw the bodies of the slain who had not yet been buried."
In 1672, Gabriel Silnicki , a castellan from Chernihiv, ceded his estates – the villages of Shmankivtsi and Shmankivchyky – to Stanisław Makowiecki, the Letychiv mayor, and his heirs.
In 1710, a tax on a quarter and a half of the smoke from the village of Shmankivtsi was levied on the maintenance of the garrison in the Okopa Holy Trinity Fortress. In 1724, the noble Józef Potocki donated his estate – part of the village of Shmankivtsi – to the monastery of the Chortkiv Dominicans.
Shmankivtsi's estate was also attacked by the nobility. In particular, the innkeeper cornet player Konstanty Lanckoroński, led by two hundred armed men, "maimed two priests and one brother; and Fr. Francis Pieszkowski tied to a horse, ran half a mile". Tomasz Makowiecki, a hunter from Lukiv, was no less cruel: his subjects beat the monks, tied them up, put them on a cart and took them out of the village. For these shameful actions, the men received sentences: Lanckoroński on 2 December 1740, and Tomasz Makowiecki on 17 December 1754. On 1 December 1755, the Uniate Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galicia, and All Rus Leo Szeptycki announced the excommunication (anathema) of them and their subjects who had taken part in the attacks.
In 1784, construction began on the wooden church of Cosmas and Damian, which was completed in 1785.
In 1785, 561 people lived in the village.
In the early 19th century, the Dominicans owned a farm with more than a hundred hectares of Shmankivtsi land. The farm was wooden. It had large rooms with two vanquiers, shingles, and a floor made of boards; it needed repair, as well as the nearby chapel.
