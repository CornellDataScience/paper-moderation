== Development and release ==

The song was inspired by the death of her long-time music producer Rex Rideout's father. "Anything for You" was released on April 3, 2020, almost a month after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Although the song was not written or released in response to the pandemic, Ledisi told digital media brand Hollywood Life that she hoped the song would inspire listeners to "fully live in every moment and love their family/friends in every way possible." "Anything for You" is also the first single to be released on Ledisi's independent recording label Listen Back Entertainment.
"Anything for You" is performed in the key of D. Jairus Mozee, who co-wrote the song, also played guitar on the song. On July 31, 2020, a duet version with PJ Morton was released.

== Music video ==
The music video of "Anything for You", released in April 2020, was directed by Ledisi's husband Ron T. Young, who also shot her previous music video "High". The music video concept was simplified and filmed with minimal alternative camera shots and cuts, and no changes to hairstyles, or costumes.
The video begins with an opening shot of a record player and the music begins as Ledisi walks into a recording studio. She is then shown performing the song in front of a condenser microphone. The video alternates between the studio performance and Ledisi performing the song in a different location in the studio. The video ends Ledisi standing next to the record player.
The music video received a nomination for Outstanding Music Video at the 52nd NAACP Image Awards in 2021.
