Anton de Kom University (Dutch: Anton de Kom Universiteit van Suriname) is the only university in Suriname. It is located in the capital, Paramaribo, and named for Anton de Kom, an anti-colonialist activist who was killed by the Nazis while in exile in the Netherlands.


== History ==


=== Founding ===
Tertiary education in Suriname dates back to the 19th century. In 1882 there was already tertiary education provided at the Geneeskundige School and there also existed an organized juridical education (The Law-school), which was founded in the late forties. Furthermore, there were other para-university courses, namely the discipline to become a surveyor, dentist and pharmacist.
At the centenary of the Estates of Suriname in 1966, this organization took the important decision to cooperate with the government of Suriname to found a university.  The proclamation was made on 1 November 1968, in the then still existing Theatre Star. Since then, the first of November is celebrated as Founders' Day.
Linguist Hein Eersel was appointed as the first chancellor of the University of Suriname.  The Faculty of Law opened first, and other faculties followed:

The Faculty der Medische Wetenschappen on 26 September 1969
The Faculty der Sociaal â€“ Economische Wetenschappen on 1 November 1975
The Faculty der Natuurtechnische Wetenschappen on 1 December 1976
The Faculty der Technische Wetenschappen on 1 December 1977


=== Renaming ===
The university was closed from December 1982 until 17 October 1983, when it was renamed after Anton de Kom.
