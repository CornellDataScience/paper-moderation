== Plot ==
Narasimha Murthy (Chiranjeevi) is a multi-talented individual working as a waiter at a star hotel (filming location: Dolphin Hotel, Visakhapatnam) due to his inability to pass his B.A. exams. He befriends Sujatha (Sumalatha), a lecturer at a college owned by councilor Ankella Adiseshayya (Satyanarayana). When Adiseshayya and his elder son Mohan (Girish) visit Sujatha's home with a marriage proposal, Sujatha objects to Adiseshayya's excessive dowry demands, leading to a heated argument. This defiance strains Sujatha's relationship with her parents, who fear social ostracism. Adiseshayya retaliates by dismissing Sujatha from her job.
Murthy offers emotional support to Sujatha during this difficult time, but their friendship is misinterpreted as a romantic relationship, forcing Sujatha to leave her home. Murthy publicly humiliates Adiseshayya at a felicitation ceremony, and in response, Adiseshayya sends goons to attack Murthy and gets him fired from his job.
Murthy then takes Sujatha to Hyderabad, where they seek help from Rao (Arun), an acquaintance Murthy met while working at the hotel. Rao, holding a senior position at Allwyn, offers Sujatha a job. Meanwhile, back home, Sujatha's younger sister Lakshmi (Tulasi) falls in love with Murali (Subhalekha Sudhakar), Adiseshayya's younger son. Murali forces his father to approve their marriage by threatening suicide, and Adiseshayya, unable to secure a large dowry, reluctantly agrees. After their marriage, Lakshmi moves in with Sujatha, and with Murali's support, files a lawsuit against Adiseshayya to demand her husband's custody, as she paid dowry for him, in a bid to teach her father-in-law a lesson.
The story culminates in Hyderabad just before Sujatha's arranged marriage to Rao. Adiseshayya, his family, and Sujatha's parents arrive to intervene. In the end, Adiseshayya is humbled, and Sujatha marries Murthy as per her wishes. The film concludes with Adiseshayya returning home to discover that his elder son Mohan has married Murthy's widowed cousin.

== Production ==
Subhalekha was written and directed by K. Viswanath, known for addressing social issues in his films. With Subhalekha, he focused on the dowry system. The film's story is considered a reworking of his earlier film Siri Siri Muvva (1976), with a similar theme later explored in his film Swarnakamalam (1988). The film's screenplay and story were developed to highlight the consequences of the dowry system, continuing Viswanath's tradition of blending social commentary with accessible storytelling.
The film was produced under the Prasanthi Creations banner by Allu Aravind and V. V. Sastry. The shooting took place across multiple locations, including the Dolphin Hotel in Visakhapatnam and Bhagyanagar Studios in Hyderabad.
The film served as a major breakthrough for actress Sumalatha, who had previously worked in smaller films. Her collaboration with Chiranjeevi in Subhalekha was followed by further successful pairings in films like Aalaya Sikharam, Khaidi, Agni Gundam, and Veta. Subhalekha also marked the debut of actor Sudhakar, who played the supporting role of Murali. Director K. Viswanath personally selected him for the role, and his character became popular enough to earn him the prefix "Subhalekha" in his screen name.


== Themes ==
Subhalekha is noted for its examination of the dowry system, a prevalent social issue in India. The film emphasizes the dignity of labor, particularly through the character of Narasimhamurthy, a waiter who stands against societal pressures related to dowry demands. The film avoids preachiness, instead delivering its message through the interactions and development of its characters.
The central theme of dowry had been previously explored in Telugu cinema, with films like Kanyasulkam (1955) and Varakatnam (1970). However, Subhalekha stood out for addressing this issue to a new generation of viewers in the 1980s. The film's characters, portrayed as everyday individuals rather than conventional cinematic heroes, added a layer of realism. Murthy's role as a waiter was unconventional for a male lead in that era, while Sujatha, the female protagonist, faces societal challenges while striving for independence.
Viswanath's signature style, blending social commentary with humanistic narratives, is evident throughout Subhalekha. The film incorporates classical Carnatic music into key moments, contributing to its distinctive narrative style. Subhalekha also falls in line with Viswanath's broader body of work, in which male protagonists support female characters in gaining confidence and independence, reinforcing themes of mutual respect and equality in relationships.


== Music ==

Music was composed by K. V. Mahadevan. The film features a mix of original compositions and classical songs. Songs like "Ragalapallakilo Koyilamma" and "Aithe... Ade Nijamaithe" were popular among the audience. The film also used traditional compositions, such as Annamacharya's "Neyyamulallo Nereello" and Tyagaraja's "Marugelara O Raghava".


== Reception ==
Subhalekha was well-received both commercially and critically. Chiranjeevi's performance was praised for balancing his dancing prowess with a grounded portrayal of Murthy. Sumalatha's performance as Sujatha showcased her maturity, despite being only 19 years old at the time. Tulasi, playing Sujatha's younger sister, was also commended for her lively performance.
The film's social relevance and K. Viswanath's deft handling of sensitive themes contributed to its success. Unlike the formulaic love stories of the time, Subhalekha stood out for its realistic characters and social messaging.


== Legacy ==
Subhalekha is considered an important film in Chiranjeevi's career, showcasing his acting and dancing abilities. The classical dance scene in the film, featuring Chiranjeevi performing various dance forms, was particularly well received. The film marked the beginning of a successful collaboration between Chiranjeevi and K. Viswanath, who later worked together on Swayamkrushi and Aapadbandhavudu.
