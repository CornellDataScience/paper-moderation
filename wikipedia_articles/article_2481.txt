In mathematics, a cuspidal cubic or semicubical parabola is an algebraic plane curve that has an implicit equation of the form

  
    
      
        
          y
          
            2
          
        
        −
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle y^{2}-a^{2}x^{3}=0}
  

(with a ≠ 0) in some Cartesian coordinate system.
Solving for y leads to the explicit form

  
    
      
        y
        =
        ±
        a
        
          x
          
            
              3
              2
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=\pm ax^{\frac {3}{2}},}
  

which imply that every real point satisfies x ≥ 0. The exponent explains the term semicubical parabola. (A parabola can be described by the equation y = ax2.)
Solving the implicit equation for x yields a second explicit form

  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          
            (
            
              
                y
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            
              2
              3
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\left({\frac {y}{a}}\right)^{\frac {2}{3}}.}
  

The parametric equation

  
    
      
        
        x
        =
        
          t
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        
        y
        =
        a
        
          t
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \quad x=t^{2},\quad y=at^{3}}
  

can also be deduced from the implicit equation by putting 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        
          
            y
            
              a
              x
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\textstyle t={\frac {y}{ax}}.}
  
 
The semicubical parabolas have a cuspidal singularity; hence the name of cuspidal cubic.
The arc length of the curve was calculated by the English mathematician William Neile and published in 1657 (see section History).

=== Singularity ===
The parametric representation 
  
    
      
        (
        
          t
          
            2

          t
          
            3
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t^{2},at^{3})}
  
 is regular except at point 
  
    
      
        (
        0
        ,
        0
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (0,0)}
  
. At point 
  
    
      
        (
        0
        ,
        0
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (0,0)}
  
 the curve has a singularity (cusp). The proof follows from the tangent vector 
  
    
      
        (
        2
        t
        ,
        3
        
          t
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (2t,3t^{2})}
  
. Only for 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=0}
  
 this vector has zero length.


=== Tangents ===
Differentiating the semicubical unit parabola 
  
    
      
        y
        =
        ±
        
          x
          
            3
            
              /
            
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=\pm x^{3/2}}
  
 one gets at point 
  
    
      
        (
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          y
          
            0
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})}
  
 of the upper branch the equation of the tangent:

  
    
      
        y
        =
        
          
            
              
                x
                
                  0
                
              
            
            2
          
        
        
          (
          
            3
            x
            −
            
              x
              
                0
              
            
          
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle y={\frac {\sqrt {x_{0}}}{2}}\left(3x-x_{0}\right).}
  

This tangent intersects the lower branch at exactly one further point with coordinates  

  
    
      
        
          (
          
            
              
                
                  x
                  
                    0
                  
                
                4
              
            
            ,
            −
            
              
                
                  y
                  
                    0
                  
                
                8
              
            
          
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {x_{0}}{4}},-{\frac {y_{0}}{8}}\right).}
  

(Proving this statement one should use the fact, that the tangent meets the curve at 
  
    
      
        (
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          y
          
            0
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})}
  
 twice.)

Determining the arclength of a curve

 one has to solve the integral 
  
    
      
        ∫

                2
              
            
            +
            
              y
              ′
            
            (
            t
            
              )
              
                2

        .

=== Isochrone curve ===
An additional defining property of the semicubical parabola is that it is an isochrone curve, meaning that a particle following its path while being pulled down by gravity travels equal vertical intervals in equal time periods. In this way it is related to the tautochrone curve, for which particles at different starting points always take equal time to reach the bottom, and the brachistochrone curve, the curve that minimizes the time it takes for a falling particle to travel from its start to its end.


== History ==
The semicubical parabola was discovered in 1657 by William Neile who computed its arc length. Although the lengths of some other non-algebraic curves including the logarithmic spiral and cycloid had already been computed (that is, those curves had been rectified), the semicubical parabola was the first algebraic curve (excluding the line and circle) to be rectified.
