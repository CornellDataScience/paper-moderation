== History ==


=== Colonial history of Hunters Hill ===
In 1855 a speculative housing venture of erecting four prefabricated Swiss Cottages at Hunters Hill was underway. In this period Hunters Hill was an established French enclave, with the residence of the French consul located there at "Passy", and much of its early development was constructed by men of French descent. The prefabricated houses were advertised as "four splendid family residences, standing in their own grounds, of about zero point four zero hectares (one acre) each", with "wood and water in abundance".
Beverley Sherry in her study of Hunter Hill notes that this was the first planned group of houses to be built in the municipality, marking the beginning of the garden suburb character of Australia's oldest Garden Suburb The subdivision and garden suburb development occurred in the mid to late nineteenth century, predating the formation of the Garden Suburb movement. The historic development at Hunters Hill was consistently speculative, although some of the subdivisions were undertaken to provide residences for family members.


=== Marika ===
The land on which Marika is built was part of a 30 acres grant made in 1835 to Frederick Augustus Hayne.
He sold to Dr. Leopold Augustus Carter, a dentist, in 1902. The house was listed as Ryde in the Sand's Directory in 1904.
In 1938 Dr. Carter sold to the Caveneagh family who sold it around 1981.
From 1981 to 1983 Marika was restored.
A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over Marika on 2 December 1983. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.
