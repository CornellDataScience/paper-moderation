Waterson is a Scottish electronic musician.


== Biography ==


=== Career ===
Waterson's first release was an album of self-produced demos called 'Dada' in 2006. His breakthrough moment however, was with a song called 'Tell Me' almost a decade later, which saw him sign to legendary UK music maker Ashley Beedle's label 'Back To The World'.
'Tell Me' was released in 2015 scoring 10/10 and a No 1 position on the Love Vinyl chart as well as support from Radio 1, 1Xtra, Capital Xtra, Kiss, Rinse, KCRW and more. NYC house innovator, Kenny Dope, took such a shine to it, that as well as playing it on his Rinse FM for 12 weeks in a row, ended up remixing it.
Waterson is currently working with Ashley Beedle, KDA and Kryptogram on his debut full-length album.
