== History ==
The Boca Raton Historical Society was created as a project incorporated by the Junior Service League in 1972, which had sparked the interest of creating a local historical museum in the Old City Hall. After two years, the society first led the Boca Raton Preservation Board project created by the city which preserved the Boca Raton Old City Hall, the Cloister Inn, the Mizner Administration Building, and the Florida East Coast Railway Station from any future destruction as they were designated as historically important. Over the span of a decade, the community started several projects to restore historical areas, including Singing Pines (also known as the Children's Museum), the relocation of the Cabana Club, the Boca Raton Old City Hall, and the F.E.C. Railway Station. By 1975, the city council of Boca Raton declares the Old Town Hall as a designated site in plans to becoming a historical museum in the future. During 1983, the historical society began the restoration for the Old Town Hall, and by November 1984, the restoration was complete as it received a $500,000 plus total of donations from corporations towards the redevelopment. The restoration effort was then awarded with the Florida Trust Award for Historic Preservation for preserving the historical site.


=== Florida East Coast Railroad Station ===

By 1985, the Boca Raton Community Redevelopment Agency purchases the Florida East Coast Railway Station from a Boca Raton restaurateur after it was previously sold by the Florida East Coast Railway company. The agency entrusted responsibility to the Boca Raton Historical Society for administering and raising funds to restore the railroad station. The society had completed their fundraising goal of earning nearly $1 million due to donations from the Boca Raton community, a $400,000 state grant, and a $500,000 donation from Countess de Hoernle in 1986. The railroad station was then renamed to Count de Hoernle Pavilion in recognition of the donation gifted from Countess de Hoernle. After a year, the members of the society restored four rail way cars, including a 1930 locomotive and caboose, as well as two streamline rail cars from 1947. Two years after the restoration, the historical society earned the Florida Trust Award for Historic Preservation due to their restoration efforts for the railroad station. By the year 2004, the historical society completed the interior restoration of the Boca Express Train Museum and publicly opens it for the first time.
