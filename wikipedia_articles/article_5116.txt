=== Houston Astros ===

The Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB) selected Kemp in the fifth round of the 2013 MLB draft. In 2015, Kemp began the season with the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Double–A Texas League. He received a midseason promotion to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Triple–A Pacific Coast League, and appeared in the 2015 All-Star Futures Game.
Kemp began the 2016 season with Fresno, and was promoted to the major leagues on May 16. He was optioned to Fresno on June 25, 2016, when A. J. Reed was called up for his debut. On August 7, 2016, Kemp was recalled to the Astros. After center fielder Carlos Gómez was designated for assignment, Kemp and Jake Marisnick platooned in centerfield. In 2016 with the Astros, he batted .217/.296/.325 with one home run in 136 plate appearances while playing primarily left field.
On March 19, 2017, he was optioned back to Fresno. On April 27, 2017 the Astros promoted Kemp to the major leagues to replace injured Teoscar Hernández. On May 1, 2017, the Astros optioned him back down as Marisnick was activated off of the disabled list.
On September 2, 2017, he was called up to the Astros and played in their doubleheader against the Mets, their first home game after Hurricane Harvey. In 17 games with the Astros, Kemp batted .216/.256/.243 with 4 RBIs while playing primarily left field. The Astros finished the season with a 101-61 record and eventually won the 2017 World Series, their first ever championship title. Kemp did not participate in any playoff action, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time, and won his first championship title.
In March 2018, the Astros optioned Kemp back to Fresno. He was called up on May 16 to replace Jake Marisnick. In the 2018 season, Kemp played in 97 games for the Astros, batting .263/.351/.392 with 6 HRs and 30 RBIs, playing primarily in left field. He was mocked by the Fenway Park crowd and organist during the second game of the 2018 American League Championship Series (ALCS) when he took an extended period of time to return to the batter's box after a foul ball. Following the third game of the 2018 ALCS, Kemp received wide sports media coverage for making a leaping catch against the left field wall on a ball hit by Steve Pearce. The Red Sox challenged the catch at the wall, since it sounded like the ball hit the wall first. After further review, they announced the catch as confirmed, meaning the MLB replay crew in New York saw conclusive evidence of the catch. In game four, Kemp hit a fourth inning solo home run off Rick Porcello after only hitting six homers during the regular season.
On July 26, 2019, the Astros designated Kemp for assignment to activate Carlos Correa. His 2019 season with the Astros ended with a .227/.308/.417 line over 163 at bats, while he had a career high with seven home runs in 66 games, prior to being traded.


=== Chicago Cubs ===

After the 2020 season, Kemp and the Athletics signed a $1.05 million contract for the 2021 season, avoiding salary arbitration. In 2021, he slashed .279/.382/.418 with 8 home runs and 37 RBIs in 131 games. His hard-hit percentage of 21.9% was, however, though the highest of his career, in the bottom 2% of the league, and his barrel percentage was in the bottom 2% of the league.
Kemp agreed to a $2.25 million salary with the Athletics for the 2022 season. In 2022, he batted .235/.307/.334 in 497 at bats. He had the lowest average exit velocity of all major league batters, at 84.4 mph, and the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls, at 14.9%.
