With the cessation of NPO Radio 5's broadcasts on 747 kHz and 1251 kHz in late 2015, the Dutch government opened a public consultation on opening up the medium waveband for low powered broadcasting. In May 2016, it was formally announced that 747, 828, 1035, 1251, and 1395 kHz (previously used by full-power stations) would have a maximum transmission power of 100 watts, while 1485 kHz would have a maximum transmission power of 1 watt.
