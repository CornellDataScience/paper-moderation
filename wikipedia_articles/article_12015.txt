The 2021 Copa CONMEBOL Libertadores de Futsal was the 20th edition of the Copa Libertadores de Futsal, South America's premier club futsal tournament organized by CONMEBOL. The tournament was held in Florida, Uruguay between 16 and 22 May 2021.
The tournament was originally scheduled to be played from 1 to 8 May 2021, but was rescheduled from 15 to 22 May at request of the Local Organizing Committee. However, the start date was delayed to 16 May due to problems with the teams' flights and permits to enter the host country.
Carlos Barbosa were the defending champions.

The remaining nine teams were split into three pots of three based on the final placement of their national association's club in the previous edition of the championship, with the highest three (Colombia, Peru and Brazil) placed in Pot 2, the next three (Vanezuela, Argentina and Chile) placed in Pot 3 and the lowest two (Bolivia and Ecuador) in pot 4, alongside the additional Uruguayan club. From each pot, the first team drawn was placed into Group A, the second team drawn placed into Group B and the final team drawn placed into Group C. Clubs from the same association could not be drawn into the same group.

The draw resulted in the following groups:
