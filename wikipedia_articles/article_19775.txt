The 2024–25 Egyptian Premier League season is the 66th edition of the Egyptian Premier League, the top professional league for association football clubs in the Egyptian football league system, since its establishment in 1948. Fixtures for the 2024–25 season were announced on 19 October 2024. Al Ahly are the defending champions.
The season started on 30 October 2024, and is scheduled to conclude on 30 May 2025.


== Format ==
Unlike previous editions of the league, the 2024–25 season follows a format similar to the one used in the Belgian Pro League and in the 2023–24 season of the Egyptian Second Division A. This change, which reduces the total number of matches each team plays from 34 to just 25, was made to ensure that the league concludes by May or June 2025, addressing the issues the league faced regarding scheduling conflicts and postponed fixtures that, since 2020, caused each season to end on a different date.
The final format was confirmed by the EPL on 18 September 2024. The league consists of 18 teams in a single group and is played in two phases. In the first phase, teams face each other once in a single-leg tie, after which the league splits into two groups. Phase two features a championship group for the teams finishing first to ninth and a relegation group for teams placed tenth to 18th. The first-place team in the championship group is crowned league champion and qualifies for the CAF Champions League alongside the runner-up, while the third-place team qualifies for the CAF Confederation Cup. Unlike the usual setup, where three teams are relegated, only the bottom two teams in the relegation group will drop to the Second Division A.


== Teams ==

A total of three teams were promoted to the league from the 2023–24 Egyptian Second Division A. The first team was champions Petrojet, who secured promotion back to the Egyptian Premier League after a four-year absence. They were joined by Ghazl El Mahalla, who reached an immediate return to the league after clinching the second promotion spot on the final day of the season. Haras El Hodoud were the last team to earn promotion, who also reached an immediate return to the league, after winning the promotion play-offs.
El Dakhleya were the first team to be relegated, whose relegation was confirmed on 21 July 2024 after two seasons in the league. On 13 August 2024, Al Mokawloon Al Arab became the second team to face relegation; ending their 19-year stay in the top flight. They were joined by Baladiyat El Mahalla, whose relegation was confirmed also on the same day, to suffer an immediate return to level two.
