In 1066 the manor of Lathom was the most important of 17 manors held by Uctred, an Anglo-Danish landowner. These manors were set up by Æthelstan in the 10th century. By 1189 Robert Fitzhenry de Lathom possessed lands throughout south Lancashire, extending to Flixton in the barony of Manchester.

Robert Lathom founded Burscough Priory in or before 1189.
The manor was conveyed by the marriage of Isabella de Lathom, Sir Thomas Lathom's daughter, to Sir John Stanley in 1385, the reign of Henry IV. Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby entertained Henry VII in his castle at Lathom.
