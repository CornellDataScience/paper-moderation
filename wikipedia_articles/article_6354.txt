Jean Thesman (1929–2016) was a popular and award-winning novelist for young adults whose predominant theme was the heroine finding her place in the world by coming to understand her family. "I loved telling the story, because I really believed that families were made up of the people you wanted, not the people you were stuck with." —Emily Shepherd
