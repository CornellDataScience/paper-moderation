== Early life and education ==
Carson was born on 11 August 1943, in Liverpool. After completing his early education at Mosspits Lane School in Liverpool and then Liverpool College, he enrolled at the University of St Andrews and received his BSc in Applied Science with majors in Electrical Engineering. He then pursued further education at City, University of London, where he obtained his MSc in Instrument & Control Engineering, and PhD in Systems Science. His dissertation was titled "Aspects of Dynamics, Control, and Identification of Metabolic Systems". Later in his career, he was awarded a DSc in Measurement & Information in Medicine.


== Career ==
Carson started his professional career as an engineer in the Computer Applications Laboratory at the Philips Electronics Company. Later he moved to academia at what is now City, University of London, becoming a Professor of Systems Science in the Department of Systems Science. During his career, he contributed in the development of several graduate and post-graduate programmes in Biomedical Engineering and related subjects. He is currently serving as a Professor Emeritus at City, University of London.
Carson was the Director of the Centre for Measurement and Information in Medicine and the Director of the Institute of Health Sciences at City, University of London. He served as an Executive Committee Member at the British Medical Informatics Society and an Expert Reviewer for the European Commission. He chaired the International Measurement Confederation (IMEKO) Technical Committee on Measurement in Medicine and Biology, the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Technical Committee on Biomedical Modelling and Control. and the Professional Network in Healthcare Technologies at the Institution of Engineering and Technology. He had involvement with all three of these professional bodies for over 20 years.


== Research ==
Carson's research has focused on the development and evaluation of systems with an emphasis on medicine and healthcare. At the beginning of his academic career, he did research on the development of mathematical models to better understand the dynamics of metabolic processes taking place in the human body. He also conducted research for the development of diabetic advisory systems.
Other major areas of research include health resource management, integrated policy modelling, healthcare technologies, modelling in physiology and medicine, and clinical decision support. He has published more than 300 peer-reviewed articles in journals.


=== Systems modelling ===
Carson has developed a range of mathematical models for human metabolic systems including plasma proteins, thyroid hormones and glucose, which helped in enhancing understanding of dynamics and control in quantitative terms. Apart from that he has developed models of the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and liver organ systems to provide an understanding in quantitative terms of a number of the underlying control processes.
In addition to his research on organ systems, Carson has also worked on investigating the complex dynamics of diabetes, which evolved into the development of modelling approaches designed to assist insulin dosage adjustment for type 1 diabetes. Approaches included differential equation modelling, rule-based expert systems and Bayesian modelling for this purpose. He has also contributed his research expertise in the intensive care unit by collecting and analysing data from monitoring systems and, using machine learning and data mining to extract clinically useful information out of these data to predict future trends.


=== Telemedicine ===
Carson uses systems science to develop models that can facilitate adoption in broader areas of science. One particular application area is the field of telemedicine which combines medical knowledge with technology. As a systems scientist, he proposed a systemic framework for the assessment and evaluation of telemedicine and telecare, taking account of a wide range of impacts. He has developed several systems to assist smooth transmission of health status regarding blood glucose levels, blood pressure, sleep patterns etc. of patients with chronic disease from their home to hospital via a small computer device to avoid travel. Based on the data received, patients would receive appropriate clinical advice if required. Using a systemic approach, he developed a telemedicine system for home haemodialysis.


=== Physiology and medicine ===
Carson has applied physiological and medical modelling to develop methodologies that can be utilised across a range of domains. In his book Introduction to Modeling in Physiology and Medicine (co-authored with Claudio Cobelli) he described the fundamental principles required for good modelling methodologies to ensure that mathematical models are fit for their particular purpose. He has also provided guidelines on basic approaches to modelling, emphasising non-linear, stochastic and Bayesian formulations including a model of insulin action during a meal/oral glucose tolerance test, a large-scale simulation model of type 1 diabetes and its use in in silico clinical trials and drug trials. In his collaborative work on evaluating different models for fluid electrolyte equilibrium, he elucidated that features of all these models, integrated into a single implementation, could provide a system of practical clinical value.
