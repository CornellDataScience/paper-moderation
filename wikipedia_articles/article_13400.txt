Bishopdale is a residential suburb located in the north of Christchurch, New Zealand.
Bishopdale lies close to Christchurch International Airport at Harewood and Christchurch's zoo, Orana Wildlife Park.


== History ==
The suburb takes its name from the three Bishop brothers, James (1826–1910), Robert (1827–1909) and William (1829–1903), who bought land in the area in 1858 or 1859 and established pipfruit orchards.  Initially, the area was called "Bishopsdale", but the second 's' was dropped from the name. Part of Greers Road (the section between Harewood Road and Sawyers Arms Road) was formerly called Bishop's Road.  It was renamed in 1948 to avoid confusion with Bishops Road in Papanui and Bishop Street in St Albans.
Much of the residental housing dates from the 1960s and decades following, and use either brick or wood, single-storey designs.  The area boasts a lot of parks and recreational areas, and a small shopping mall.
