== History ==
The county board was created in 1960 when it was deemed that the number of clubs in the region north of London supported a separate league. The area is not in fact just Hertfordshire but encompasses Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire.


=== Present Day ===
Hertfordshire is probably among the weakest of the British counties as a result of the small number of large population centres in the region it serves. It has further been affected by the general trend of reduced emigration from Ireland to the UK since the 1980s. As a result, a number of the original clubs have folded – including the Milton Keynes-based team, Erin Go Bragh, in 2005. However, a resurgence may be underway. The youth sections of the county have proven to be very promising and in 2018 the Hertfordshire under-14s won the Féile Peile na nÓg in Meath, and followed this by winning a shield competition in Connacht the year after.
