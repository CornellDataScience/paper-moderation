The Myanmar women's national football team is the female association football team representing Myanmar and is controlled by Myanmar Football Federation (MFF).


== History ==
Myanmar played its first game in 1995, against the Philippines, which they drew 1-1 in the 1995 Southeast Asian Games. Since then, Myanmar has received more money from the state and improved its game.
In 2005, the country was one of several teams that included Brunei, Thailand, Indonesia, East Timor, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Burma and Singapore, that fielded a women's football team to compete at the Asian Games in Marikina in December.
Myanmar first took part in the 2003 AFC Women's Championship held in Thailand, and has since qualified five times. They have never progressed beyond the group stage in the tournament. In the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup, they had come close to winning the first group game and qualify for the knockout stage for the first time, but a 2-2 draw to Vietnam after taking the lead twice put an end to that hope.
