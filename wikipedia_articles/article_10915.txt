== Music video ==
The music video for "Eighteen" was directed by Adam Powell and premiered on 22 August 2018. The video follows Baron-Gracie as she goes on a road trip across the United States. Footage of Baron-Gracie walking through a forest, staying in a motel, visiting a diner, and driving in her car. Interspersed with this footage are brief and intimate shots of Baron-Gracie and an unseen lover. While talking to Taylor Henderson of Pride Magazine, Baron-Gracie explained that the video for "Eighteen" is "all about [her] sort of looking for that [unseen lover] or trying to find that person." Initially, the video did not feature the quick cuts to Baron-Gracie and the aforementioned lover, as the artist explained:

In "Eighteen", there's a moment where you see me with another person ... [That is] actually my stylist. It wasn't intentional. ... On the day, we filmed the whole entire video, and then we looked at the video and thought, "Hey, this isn't going to make sense. You need to see me with somebody for this video to make sense." ... We were like, "Who can we put in the video?" ... And then I was like, "Patty will you be in the video?" And you know, she's this straight, Italian, amazing woman, and she was like, "OK, I will, but I don't really want to!" So she's in the video.
As of January 2024, the video has been viewed over 2.5 million times on YouTube.
