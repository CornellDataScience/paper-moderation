Born in Cali to a Colombian father and a Spanish mother, Espinosa and his family moved to Marbella when he was 10 and he finished his youth career in the country with Sevilla FC. After appearing in one match for the reserves in 2007–08 (five minutes) he proceeded to spend a further three full seasons with them, one in the Segunda División and two in the Segunda División B, only starting regularly in his last.
Espinosa made his first-team – and La Liga – debut on 11 May 2011, playing 90 minutes in a 3–2 away loss against CA Osasuna. In the ensuing summer, he was loaned to Racing de Santander in a season-long move.
Espinosa scored his first top-flight goal for the Cantabrians on 7 January 2012, heading home the game's only in a home win against Real Zaragoza.

On 26 December 2012, after not featuring at all for Sevilla in the first half of the campaign, Espinosa was loaned to Sporting de Gijón in the second division. The following 26 June he signed a permanent three-year contract, scoring three goals while only missing one game in 42 in the 2014–15 campaign to help the Asturians to return to the top tier after three years.
Espinosa missed the second part of 2015–16, due to a serious knee injury.


=== Middlesbrough ===
On 15 June 2016, at the expiration of his contract, Espinosa joined newly promoted Premier League side Middlesbrough on a three-year deal.
