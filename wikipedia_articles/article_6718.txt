== Early life ==
Spencer Joseph was born on January 1, 1999, in Denver, Colorado. Joseph began playing the cello at the age of 11, revealing an early interest in music. He began creating original music at 14 with a laptop and his father's old gaming headset, initially as a new hobby to replace his interest in art, particularly oil pastels. However, after a few months, he shifted to experimenting with singing and creating experimental R&B. Joseph pursued his passion for music and began taking singing lessons while actively participating in his school's choir.

The mixtape includes collaborations from artists Liz, Ravenna Golden, and Tama Gucci, as well as a cover of Soulja Boy's "Kiss Me thru the Phone".
