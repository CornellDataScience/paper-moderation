The men's high jump at the 2022 World Athletics Championships was held at the Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, on 15 and 18 July.


== Summary ==
Eleven athletes cleared 2.28m, so it turned out a clean round to 2.25m was good enough to get 13 (12 plus ties) into the final.  In the final ten survived 2.27m, only five got over 2.30m. Defending champion, co-Olympic Champion Mutaz Essa Barshim, Woo Sang-hyeok and Shelby McEwen all had perfect rounds going and thus were tied for first place. Co-Olympic Champion Gianmarco Tamberi cleared on his last attempt to hold on to the fifth spot.  At 2.33m Woo missed, Andriy Protsenko made it on his first attempt to take the lead, for the 30 seconds it took for Barshim to be called and also clear, with a clean round, to take the lead back. Tamberi cleared on his second attempt to take over third place while McEwen missed twice and saved his last remaining attempt for the next height.  At 2.35m, Woo and Protsenko missed, Barshim remained perfect and McEwen bowed out. Woo made it on his second attempt to keep the competition alive, Protsenko and Tamberi missed. Protsenko elected to save his final attempt for 2.37m, Tamberi missed and was out. At 2.37 m (7 ft 9+1‚ÅÑ4 in), Woo then Protsenko missed, leaving Protsenko with the bronze. Barshim cleared it again leaving Woo no other choices but to pass. And after Woo missed at 2.39m made the calculated gamble. If Woo made his final attempt, Barshim could lose gold at the last second, or at least be pressured to make one of the top 10 jumps in history (which he has done on 5 occasions). Woo failed, taking silver. A perfect round and gold already in hand, Barshim took one attempt at 2.42m and called it a day.
