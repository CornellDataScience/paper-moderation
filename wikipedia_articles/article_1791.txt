Arthur Gabriel Hebert  (1886–1963) was an English monk of Kelham, Nottinghamshire (more strictly a member of the Society of the Sacred Mission), and a proponent within Anglicanism of the ideas of the Liturgical Movement.    
Hebert was very much aware of the social implications of liturgical renewal in Continental Europe through contact with Benedictine monasteries in Austria and Germany as well as having contact with artists in Protestant circles in Switzerland.     

Furthermore, his interactions with the high church Lutheran movement in Sweden led to becoming a translator of several works from Swedish to English. This included Gustaf Aulén's groundbreaking book on the atonement, Christus Victor, when it was published in English in 1931. Aulén would later say in his autobiography that it was Hebert that came up with that name for the work and that he preferred the Englishman's name for it than his own, Den Kristna Försoningstanken (SV. = EN. The Christian Concept of Reconciliation). Hebert would also translate Part I of Anders Nygren's important work Eros och Agape into English in 1932.
Hebert was, in some respects, a disciple of Gregory Dix.
