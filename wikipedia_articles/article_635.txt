The Dort Financial Center (originally IMA Sports Arena and formerly Perani Arena and Event Center) is a sports, entertainment and convention venue located in Flint, Michigan, United States. It opened in 1969 and is the home of the Flint Firebirds who play in the Ontario Hockey League.


== Facilities ==

The main arena of the complex, the largest exhibit hall of complex, features 29,280 square feet (2,720 m2) of space and can accommodate 4,021 for ice hockey and 6,069 for concerts, plus 400 in standing room. The second arena in the complex features 27,206 square feet (2,527.5 m2) of space. Both arenas are frequently used for trade shows, conventions, hockey games and other sports. In addition, the main arena is used for concerts.
Initially named the IMA, an acronym for the Industrial Mutual Association. Being the second such complex in Flint, MI called the IMA, The IMA Auditorium was turned into part of the AutoWorld complex.
The complex was named for Bob Perani, owner of Perani's Hockey World, a sports equipment retailer in Flint. Perani's Hockey World paid for naming rights to the complex. Bob Perani was a goalie for the Flint Generals from 1969 to 1974. His jersey, #1, is one of only five numbers retired by the team.
In 2020, the Dort Financial Center underwent renovations and updating. Renovations included updated seating in the main arena, as well as LED ribbon panels that would encircle the entire arena. The updated black leather seats, as well as the LED panels, were both acquired from The Palace of Auburn Hills before it was demolished. The renovations gave the arena a uniform seating appearance, while the LED panels are capable of displaying advertisements and sports scoreboards simultaneously.
