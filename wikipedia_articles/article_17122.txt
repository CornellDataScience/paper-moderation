Meat Puppets is the debut studio album by American rock band the Meat Puppets, released in 1982 through SST Records. 
The 1999 Rykodisc reissue features the entire In a Car EP as well as 13 other bonus tracks, many of them studio jams or outtakes, and a video clip of the band performing "Walking Boss" live. The booklet also has liner notes by Gregg Turkington and recording notes by drummer Derrick Bostrom.
In the 2012 book, Too High to Die: Meet the Meat Puppets by Greg Prato, an entire chapter is dedicated to Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil explaining why Meat Puppets is one of his favorite all-time albums.


== Background and recording ==
The album was recorded in three to four days. There are very few overdubs on the album, and many of the tracks are first takes. Like other early SST albums the sound quality is rather spotty; there is noticeable fuzz in the background of the music. The band opted for this because they felt more comfortable recording live with only a few microphones rather than employing conventional studio separation techniques. In 1999, Curt Kirkwood stated, "The first [album] was our LSD record. We were three days in the studio, and we tripped the whole time. And it was really cool, and really trying, too, because we went insane." The original pressing of the 12" album is engineered to be played back at 45 rpm.


== Style ==
Unlike the band's later releases, Meat Puppets features a hardcore punk sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Meat Puppets a "full-on punk record".
