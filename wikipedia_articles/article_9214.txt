BOS Nation Football Club is a planned American professional women's soccer team based in Boston, Massachusetts, that will compete in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) starting in 2026. BOS Nation FC will play its home games at White Stadium.


== History ==


=== Background ===
The Boston Breakers competed in Women's Professional Soccer from 2009 to 2011. The league folded in early 2012, and that year, the Breakers competed in the Women's Premier Soccer League Elite. After one season, the club joined the National Women's Soccer League for its inaugural season in 2013. The club folded after the 2017 season with reports generally blaming a lack of marketing and resultant limited fanbase.


=== 2026 expansion bid ===
On September 19, 2023, an NWSL expansion team was announced, with a planned start date in 2026. The ownership group of the winning bid, Boston Unity Soccer Partners (BUSP), is an all-female ownership group led by Jennifer Epstein, Stephanie Connaughton, Ami Danoff, and Anna Palmer. Later investors joined, including Aly Raisman, Elizabeth Banks, Brad and Tracy Stevens, and Linda Henry. The team will play home matches in White Stadium in Franklin Park, Boston.
The City of Boston planned to commit up to $50 million towards the stadium's renovation, and BUSP pledged $30 million. The stadium is to be the first venue in the country which will be home to a major league sports franchise and the athletic program of a public high school. The stadium will be shared with Boston Public Schools track and soccer. American football matches will be prohibited at the field during the professional soccer season, although high school football will be played on the field for playoffs and Thanksgiving games.
The club's name and its black-and-green branding were announced on October 15, 2024, during a marketing campaign that said "there are too many balls in this town". BOS Nation FC was selected as a play on the name of the city ("BOS Nation" is an anagram of "Bostonian") and the word boss; other options included Boston FC, Boston Unity, and names having to do with weather.
On October 16, BOS Nation FC posted an apology on social media amid criticism of its initial marketing campaign of "Too Many Balls" from the LGBTQ community, particularly those identifying as transgender. While the "Too Many Balls" campaign was intended to highlight the male-dominated nature of Boston sports teams, it was seen as transphobic.
In November 2024, the team announced a review of their name and that they are working to “create a club that represents the strength, diversity, and passion” of Boston.
