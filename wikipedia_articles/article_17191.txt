Whereas the area was populated from the 11th century, and an archeological site existing in Dedovichi shows that a fortress was located there in medieval times, the settlement of Dedovichi was founded in 1901 to serve a railway station, one of the five built on the stretch between Dno and Novosokolniki on the railway connecting Saint Petersburg and Kiev. At the time, Dedovichi was part of Porkhovsky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate.
On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Dedovichsky District was established, with the administrative center in Dedovichi. The governorates were abolished as well, and the district became a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Between August 1941 and February 1944, Dedovichi was occupied by German troops. On August 23, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Pskov Oblast. In 1967, Dedovichi was granted an urban-type settlement status.
