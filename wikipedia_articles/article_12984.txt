Zahir-od-dowleh Cemetery (Persian: ظهيرالدوله) is located in Darband, close to Tajrish, Shemiran (now a neighbourhood inside Tehran's city limits).  It serves as the final resting place for numerous Iranian artists, poets, and musicians.


== History ==
Ali Khan-e Zahir-od-Dowleh, head of the Society of Brotherhood (Anjoman-e Okhovat)  passed away from a heart attack on Friday, June 27, 1924, in his garden in Jafarabad, Shemiran. He was interred in a public cemetery near his garden, located between Tajrish and Imamzadeh Qasim in Shemiran. This site was previously home to an old cemetery, and later the Zahir-od-Dowleh Khanqah (Safa' alishah ) was relocated to this place. Following Zahir-od-Dowleh's burial, his disciples named the old cemetery and khanqah "Zahir-od-Dowleh Safa Ali Cemetery."
The burial site of Zahir-od-Dowleh was situated beneath a tree known as "Daghdaghan," where he often sat during his lifetime. Before his burial, he was ritually washed by Mowlavi Rashti, who was also later buried at the same site. The Society of Brotherhood (Anjoman-e Okhovat) enclosed this public cemetery, officially naming it "Zahir-od-Dowleh Safa Ali Cemetery."
Owing to Zahir-od-Dowleh Safa Ali's popularity among various social classes, numerous artists, politicians, and scholars requested to be buried in this cemetery. As a result, the khanqah custodians and Zahir-od-Dowleh's disciples garnered considerable revenue from selling burial plots.
From the 1960s onward, burials in this complex were prohibited, with exceptions granted through special permits and in limited numbers during the 1960s and 1970s. The last burial at Zahir-od-Dowleh Safa Ali Cemetery occurred in 1979, with the interment of General Ali Neshat.
