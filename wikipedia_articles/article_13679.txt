Warren Mott High School (WMHS, commonly referred to as Mott) is a public high school in Warren, Michigan, United States. It is part of the Warren Consolidated Schools district. It was founded in 1992 by the merger of the previous Warren High School and Charles Stewart Mott High School.


== History ==
Mott opened in 1965. It was originally named after Charles Stewart Mott who was a businessman and philanthropist.
In late 2003 the building went through renovations. The school board bought St Paul Albanian Catholic Church turning it to a new performing arts center. The renovations included security measures and a newly designed front entrance, climate control systems in the rooms, and new windows in every room that can serve as a fire escape in the event of an emergency.
During the 2011 Michigan education budget cuts, Warren Mott High School became, according to the Michigan Legislature, the most concerned school, attracting the attention of 12 Mile traffic with the "Go Red for Public Ed" protests.
Warren Mott went through various renovations during the Summer of 2011, including a complete parking lot change, roof repair, and technology upgrade. These renovations were funded by the millage passed in November 2009.


== Band ==
The "Marauder Music Machine", is put together from four smaller bands of different musical levels; Cadet, Concert, Symphonic, and Wind Ensemble. The marching band has received division one ratings for the past five years at the MSBOA Marching Band Festival for their halftime show performances. They have been featured numerous times on the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the Jazz band has also played at the 2008 Detroit Jazz Festival.
