== History ==
Șoimii Lipova was founded in 1974 after a merger between Mureșul Lipova and Luptătorul Lipova.                                                             
In the first season, 1974–75 Arad County Championship, the squad based in Lipova finished on the 4th place, then in the following season, 1975–76, won the county championship and qualifying for the Divizia C promotion play-off, but lost in front of Timiș County champion, Laminorul Nădrag (1–0 at Nădrag and 0–2 at Lipova).                                                                                 
Followed three seasons in which Șoimii finished on the following positions: 4th (1976–77 and 1977–78) and 9th (1978–79) in the second series of the County Championship.                                                             
In the 1979–80 season, Șoimii Lipova won the county championship again, finished 1st in Series B and won the championship final against the winner of the Series A, Chimia Arad (1–0 at Lipova and 3–3 at Vladimirescu). Followed a promotion play-off match to Divizia C against the champion of Liga IV – Timiș County, Textila Timișoara. Șoimii promoted after two victories (3–1 at Timișoara and 2–1 at Lipova).
After the promotion, in the summer of 1980, the team starts collaborating with the lathe factory from Lipova changing its name to Șoimii-Strungul, and at the end of the first season in Divizia C, Șoimii-Strungul, with a new coach, Toma Jurcă, finished on the 4th place.

Followed another 12 consecutive seasons in the Divizia C for Șoimii, which also won the 11th series of the league at the end of the 1991–92 season, but never played in the Divizia B due to some competitive reorganizations dictated by the Romanian Football Federation.
