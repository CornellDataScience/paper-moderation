== Reception ==
The Indian Express stated the show as an average one reviewing, "Sajan Ghar Jana Hai, though has a fresh cast, yet it fails when it comes to weaving an engrossing tale. At times, the goings-on in the show are not engrossing. Also, what mars the show is its slow pace. Some fine editing should do the trick! Kunal Bhatia performs in a restrained manner. Neha Saxena despite having a pretty screen presence fails to look believable in her role."
