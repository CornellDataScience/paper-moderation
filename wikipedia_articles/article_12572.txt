== History ==
The Henderson Valley is in the traditional rohe of Te Kawerau ā Maki, and was traditionally known as Ōpanuku. Ōpanuku refers to one of the oldest Te Kawerau ā Maki ancestors, Panuku, the wife of Parekura who died after being kidnapped by a warrior named Nihotupu. Te Kawerau ā Maki had a settlement along the Opanuku Stream known as Ōpareira. The name refers to Pareira, the niece of early ancestor and voyager Toi-te-huatahi. Pareira lived at Te Wai-o-Pareira / Henderson Creek and would seasonally inhabit the Henderson Valley, harvesting the resources of the forest.
The Opanuku Stream which flows down the valley was one of the earliest waterways to be dammed for kauri logging in West Auckland, in the 1850s. The valley was settled by pākehā by the 1880s, with Henderson Valley Road providing access.
In the 1920s, the Henderson Valley Scenic Reserve/Carey Park was a popular picnic and swimming area known as Ferndale, where the Brown Owl Tea Rooms was located.
