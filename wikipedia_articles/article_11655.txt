In January 2023, North Kore put its capital, Pyongyang, on a 5-day lockdown due to a reported "respiratory illness", though it did not mention COVID-19. Residents were told to stay home and submit to temperature checks multiple times daily. The lockdown has been lifted, but North Korea was reportedly, "yet to fully return to pre-pandemic normalcy".

== Reliability of the confirmed counts ==
Doctors and media expressed scepticism of official infection counts in some countries, and statistical analysis suggested anomalies. Sceptics of the Russian official counts included medical doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva, doctors Ivan Konovalov and Samuel Greene, and medical news editor Aleksey Torgashev. The Nexta media agency stated that it had obtained leaked administrative documents showing higher infection counts than those publicly stated by Belarusian authorities. Statistical analysis of official counts from around the world found signs of "suspiciously low statistical noise" in the officially confirmed counts of some countries, with the Algerian counts including a 28-day sequence with a strongly sub-Poissonian noise level, and 28-day sequences best modelled as having sub-Poissonian noise for the daily confirmed counts in Tajikistan, Turkey, Russia, Belarus, Albania, the United Arab Emirates and Nicaragua.
Lower statistical noise in the official infection counts is statistically associated with less press freedom, as measured by the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index. Benford's law analysis of the rising phase of the pandemic per country found that the official counts are more statistically credible for countries that are more democratic, have higher GDP per capita, or have more health funding or better universal health insurance systems.
