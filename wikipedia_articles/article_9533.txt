== History ==


=== 1958-1968 ===
Caldicot School (formally Caldicot Community College) welcomed its first intake of pupils on the 1st of September 1958. The College opened with 19 teachers and room to accommodate 400 students in a three-story building, to the west of the school's site. This building later became known as Grayhill Building, named after Grayhill. 


=== 1969-1974 ===
On the 3rd of September 1969 the school became comprehensive and changed its name to Caldicot Comprehensive School. To accommodate more pupils, a new four storey block was opened that could accommodate a further 600 pupils. It housed a canteen, gymnasium, 20 classrooms and a science block. This building was originally known as Upper School, until a further block was built in 1973 making it known as Middle School and then later becoming known as Castle School, named after Caldicot Castle. 

In 1973 a third block was built, known originally as Upper School, later becoming called Deepweir, named after the Deepweir area of Caldicot. The three storey building was at the eastern end of the school's site and housed the sixth form.
In 1974 Mr. W.A. Silk retired due to ill health. Mr. Eric Blackaby became acting Head Teacher.


=== 1975-1980 ===
In 1975 Mr. C.A. Vanloo became Head Teacher.


=== 1981-2001 ===
In 1981 Mr. J. Norwood became Head Teacher.
The school celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1985 and had 1650 pupils and 99 staff at the time.
In December 2001 Mr. J. Norwood announced he would retire as Head Teacher at the end of the academic year after 22 years' service to the school.


=== 2002-present day ===
A £2 million science block was opened in July 2002 which housed four laboratories. The block was connected to the science block in Castle School building.
In September 2002 Mrs. S. Gwyer-Roberts became Head Teacher after the retirement of Mr. J. Norwood.
By the 2000s the school's four teaching buildings were becoming dilapidated and unfit for purpose so a new building was planned. The new build was a result of the Welsh Government's 21st Century Schools & Education Capital Programme. It was scheduled to cost £31million, which then rose to £34.9 million, but at the time of completion it was said to have cost a total of £36.5 million.
In February 2014 a plan to sell four acres of the school's playing field was approved to supermarket chain ASDA, generating £4 million towards the building of the new school. The rest of the money needed for the new build was paid for by Monmouthsire County Council and the Welsh Government.
In early 2016 the Technology Department's building, the 'Tech Block' along with the 'Learning Centre' were knocked down to make-way for the new build. Until the new build's completion, the Technology Department and Learning Centre were housed in temporary buildings on the school's site.
On Monday 11 September 2017 the new build opened. The three floor new building has capacity for 1,500 students and houses all subject departments under one roof, as opposed to the previous four main blocks which served the school.

In addition pupils must choose three option subjects. A variety of options are available which include some vocation courses.


=== Key Stage 5 ===
In KS5 pupils chose between studying two, three or four subjects to study to 'A' Level in addition to the Advance Welsh Baccalaureate qualification.


== Welsh language ==
Although Caldicot School is an English medium school, all pupils must learn Welsh until KS4 in accordance with the Welsh Language Act 1993. Welsh is taught as a second language. According to the school's 2013 Estyn report, 'Very few pupils speak Welsh as their first language.' The report also mentioned 'in Welsh second language, standards and teaching are very good'.
The school started teaching Welsh in 1996 after the Welsh Office ended a dispensation that exempted three comprehensive schools in Monmouthshire to teach Welsh. Until 2017 when the GCSE short course Welsh Second Language qualification was scrapped, Caldicot School was the only school in Monmouthshire to make the full course compulsory to all pupils and had done since September 2008.
The school has a bilingualism policy which supports the role of incidental Welsh within the school and makes sure Welsh is available at A Level.

=== 2013 Estyn inspection ===
The school's most recent Estyn inspection took place in 2013 and placed it as 'Good' in every category. The report said that 'in Welsh second language, standards and teaching are very good'. This was a succession from the school's 2007 inspection which also placed it as 'Good'.
