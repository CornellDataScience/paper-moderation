Genkō (元亨) was a Japanese era name (年号, nengō, "year name") after Gen'ō and before Shōchū. This period spanned the years from February 1321 to December 1324. The reigning Emperor was Go-Daigo-tennō (後醍醐天皇).


== Change of era ==
1321 Genkō gannen (元亨元年): The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in Gen'ō 3. The era name is derived from the I Ching; it should not be confused with the later Genkō (1331–1334), which used a different character for kō (弘, "wide", instead of 亨, "go smoothly.")
