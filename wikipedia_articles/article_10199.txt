Stallone also played himself in a recurring role on the short-lived sitcom Movie Stars, alongside fellow celebrity siblings Don Swayze and Joey Travolta.
Stallone was the subject of repeated non-sequitur punchlines delivered by comedian Norm Macdonald during the Weekend Update segment of the television show Saturday Night Live. On Instagram, Stallone said he enjoyed the jokes and expressed regret that they were never able to work together before Macdonald's death from leukemia.


=== 2000s and 2010s ===
Stallone appeared as a boxing consultant on the NBC reality television series The Contender in 2005. He appeared on the Howard Stern radio show on several occasions.

Following a parade in Melbourne, Stallone performed "Far from Over" to an audience of over 2,000 people. Hamish & Andy were big fans of the song, claiming it always pumped them up, and they dubbed the phenomenon "The Frank Effect". Stallone said of the night, "This is seriously one of the best, best times I've ever had."
