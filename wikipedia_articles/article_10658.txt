In September 2013, 2 teenage boys were arrested at Eleanor Roosevelt High School for connections to a sexual assault case, where witnesses stated that they were raping a freshman girl. One of the students arrested was allegedly recently expelled for an unrelated issue and is now attending another high school in Corona. 
In October 2019, Joe Robles Jr., a Cross Country Coach at Eleanor Roosevelt High School, was arrested for suspicion of having sexual relationships with multiple students. He was charged with multiple counts of sexual assaults against former students, including rape of a minor under 14. He was later convicted of the charges and is currently serving a four-year prison sentence at California State Prison at Lancaster as of 2022.
In April 2022, Amanda Quinonez, an English Language Arts teacher and Water Polo coach at Eleanor Roosevelt High School was arrested for suspicion of sending explicit photographs to a student of hers.

In November 2023, another teacher, Chad Costello, was arrested for inappropriate contact with students, he was charged with child sexual battery. The investigations started in April 2023, and Costello was subsequently placed on administrative leave during the investigation, he has now been released by the district. 
In February 2024, Dr. Greg Anderson, the principal of Eleanor Roosevelt High School, was arrested in connection to the case of Costello's inappropriate contact.
