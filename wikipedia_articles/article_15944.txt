The history of PAC began in the drawing room of Mr. Ishfaq Ahmed, the founder of PAC. He started by teaching two students in his drawing room. Realizing the dearth of quality institutes in the field of Accountancy, he established PAC in 1987. Mr. Ishfaq Ahmed aimed to revolutionize the field of accountancy by introducing innovative teaching methods such as using audio and visual aids in class; holding regular group discussions with his students; conducting weekly quizzes and presenting practical bookkeeping. By late 90s, PAC had solidified its name as the premiere accountancy institute in the country.

The decision of Mr. Ishfaq Ahmed bore fruit when PAC secured its first gold medal through its student Mr. Ali Zeb. It was an assurance that PAC was headed in the right direction.
