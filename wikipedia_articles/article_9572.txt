== Career ==

Anwar entered the Hindi music industry by chance. In 1989, on a sightseeing visit to Bombay, he happened to meet Roop Kumar Rathod. Impressed by his Shayri, Roop Kumar Rathore introduced him to Mahesh Bhatt. And, Mahesh Bhatt was so impressed by his Shayari that he asked to join the Film Industry and even promised to give the break. 
And Mahesh Bhatt kept his promise. Mahesh Bhatt was working on a subject and had the music ready for a song but wanted Shayri with a touch of sensibility and human feel. He tried many established lyricists but they could not satiate Mahesh Bhatt's demanding soul. He asked Faaiz Anwaar to write lyrics. In 40 min. what Faaiz Anwaar wrote, went to become musical milestone of Music Industry. This was the title song "Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin" which stayed on the top of the most popular Radio Programme Cibaca Geetmala for almost two years. Soon, followed musical hit film of the year "Imtihaan" and Saajan” which consolidated his place in the Film Industry. He was nominated for Best Lyricist for his debut song "Dil Hai Ke Maanta Nahi" (Film: Dil Hai Ke Maanta Nahin), "Is Tarah Aashiqui Ka Asar...
