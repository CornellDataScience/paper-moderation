== Production ==
Desika made his directorial debut with the film, after having apprenticed under Thambi Ramaiah, Sairamani and Sakthi Chidambaram for fifteen years. He approached real estate businessman, Jaya Ilavarasan, with the script and persuaded him to finance the film. The team began filming scenes across Chennai in September 2012 under the title of Vaalu. During production, the film faced a legal dispute over the title with the makers of the Silambarasan movie Vaalu. The Tamil Film Producers Council concluded that Desika's team had not registered the title and the film was renamed Rettai Vaalu.


== Soundtrack ==
The music for the film was composed by V. Selvaganesh, and the lyrics were written by Vairamuthu. In June 2013, the team held an audio launch function where the first CD was released by Vairamuthu and received by producers R. B. Choudary and Keyaar.
