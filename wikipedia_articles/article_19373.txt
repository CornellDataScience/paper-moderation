Haplogroup S-M230, also known as S1a1b (and previously as S* or K2b1a4), is a Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup. It is by far the most numerically significant subclade of Haplogroup S1a (and its sole primary subclade, Haplogroup S-P405).
S-M230 is commonly found among populations of the highlands of Papua New Guinea (Kayser 2003). It is also found at lower frequencies in adjacent parts of Indonesia and Melanesia. (Kayser 2003 Cox 2006)


== Origin ==


== Distribution ==
One study has reported finding haplogroup S-M230 in: 52% (16/31) of a sample from the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Highlands; 21% (7/34) of a sample from the Moluccas; 16% (5/31) of a sample from the Papua New Guinea coast; 12.5% (2/16) of a sample of Tolai from New Britain; 10% (3/31) of a sample from Nusa Tenggara, and; 2% (2/89) of a sample from the West New Guinea lowlands/coast.(Kayser 2003 Cox 2006)
One subclade, Haplogroup S-M226.1 (S1a1b1d1a; previously S1d) has been found at low frequencies in the Admiralty Islands and along the coast of mainland PNG. (Kayser 2008).

=== History ===

Prior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely.  The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.


==== Research publications ====
The following research teams per their publications were represented in the creation of the YCC tree.


==== 2005 YCC tree ====


==== 2008 YCC tree ====
From 2002 to 2008, it was known as Haplogroup K5.
