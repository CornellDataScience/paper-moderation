== History ==
The first written mention of Ivanovice dates from 1358. It was always a small village, the size of which did not change until the 19th century. Ivanovice belonged to Řečkovice, it was first owned by the Augustinian Monastery in Brno, after its abolition in 1581 by the Jesuits in Brno. Finally, after 1773, Řečkovice acquired secular holders. The old imperial road connecting Brno with Svitavy ran east of Ivanovice, along which a new imperial road was built from 1752. Ivanovice recorded growth only in the 20th century, more significant growth has been occurring since the 1970s.
Some lands in the south of modern Ivanovice were annexed to Brno a total of two times. Until the 1960s, these lands were part of Řečkovice, within which they were annexed to Brno as early as 16 April 1919. During the cadastral reform of Brno in 1966–1969, these lands were separated from Brno and annexed to the then municipality of Ivanovice u Brna, which was then annexed into Brno on 26 November 1971. Within Brno, Ivanovice was incorporated into the Brno VI-Řečkovice district, renamed on 1 May 1972, to Brno-Řečkovice.
On 1 January 1976, based on the resolution dated 12 December 1975, Ivanovice acquired its current northern and western borders, when it acquired 4 hectares of land from Jinačovice, and 10 hectares from Česká, while at the same time 4.02 hectares of land passed from Ivanovice to Česká. From 21 September 1972 to 23 November 1990, Ivanovice was part of the Brno V municipal district, administered by Královo Pole. On 24 November 1990, the current city district of Brno-Ivanovice was established.
