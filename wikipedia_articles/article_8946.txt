Gregory Paul Currie ()  FAHA is a British philosopher and academic, known for his work on philosophical aesthetics and the philosophy of mind. Currie is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of York and Executive Editor of Mind & Language.


== Life and work ==
Currie was educated at the John Ruskin Grammar School in Surrey, at the London School of Economics (LSE), where he took the BSc (Econ), and at the University of California, Berkeley, as a Fulbright Scholar. In 1978 Currie completed his PhD in Philosophy at the LSE, where he worked with Imre Lakatos and produced a thesis examining the objectivism of Frege and Popper. Following Lakatos's death in 1974 Currie and his LSE colleague, John Worrall, co-edited two volumes of Lakatos's philosophical papers, The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes, Vol. 1 and Mathematics, Science and Epistemology, Vol. 2, both published in 1978.
Currie started his career as a scholar of Frege, publishing Frege: An Introduction to his Philosophy in 1982, but his interests shifted gradually to aesthetics and the philosophy of mind. He published An Ontology of Art in 1989 and The Nature of Fiction in 1990. Since the late 1980s Currie has published six research monographs; a collection of articles, Arts and Mind (OUP 2004); and nearly 100 research articles on topics in the philosophy of art and the philosophy of mind and cognition. Currie is widely considered to be one of the most influential living Anglophone philosophers of art post-1945.
Currie is Professor of Philosophy at the University of York, serving as Head of the Department of Philosophy from 2013 to 2016. Before moving to York in 2013 he was a professor at the University of Nottingham (2000–13). At Nottingham Currie served as Dean of the Faculty of Arts (2004–07) and then as Director of Research for the School of Humanities (2010–13). Before his return to the UK Currie was Professor and Head of the School of Arts at Flinders University, Adelaide. His first posts were in Australia, at the University of Sydney, and in New Zealand, at the University of Otago.
Currie is Executive Editor of Mind & Language, and a member of the editorial boards for both the Australasian Journal of Philosophy and the British Journal of Aesthetics. He is a Past President of the Australasian Association of Philosophy, a past Fellow of St John's College, Oxford, and he has held visiting positions at Clare Hall, Cambridge, the LSE, the Institute for Advanced Study, Australian National University, the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of St Andrews, and the EHESS. Currie was a member of the Philosophy sub-panel for REF 2014.
In July 2019 Currie was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. He was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA) in 1996.
