In July 2023 at San Diego Comic-Con, Adult Swim unveiled a teaser trailer for the series and announced it would premiere in 2024. In January 2024, Adult Swim announced that the series would premiere on its Toonami programming block on February 11, 2024, in both English dubbed and subtitled formats, both produced by Sentai Studios.
The opening theme song is "Vengeance" performed by Japanese rock band Coldrain, while the ending theme song is "Eye Openers" performed by Jessica Gelinas.

In June 2024, Sola Entertainment CEO Joseph Chou was paraphrased through a Business Wire press release covering the Shinobi Origins video game as stating that a second season of the anime was in the works, however several hours after its publication, the show's executive producer Jason DeMarco replied to a Bluesky post that a second season had "not been announced". The following day, the press release was retracted and Chou responded to an inquiry from Anime News Network, clarifying that the game's public relations staff had inserted the quote themselves and that, while ideas were being considered for a potential second season, "there is nothing official at all".
