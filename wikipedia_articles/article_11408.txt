In 2005, Grabenstein's debut novel was the first in the adult Ceepack Mysteries series, Tilt-a-Whirl, called an "entertaining debut" by The New York Times and given a Library Journal starred review. He has subsequently written more books in this series, called a "mash-up of Jersey Shore, Big Brother, and Survivor."
Grabenstein has also written many novels for children, including the Agatha and Anthony award-winning Haunted Mysteries series and the New York Times bestselling Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library. He has also co-authored a number of books with author James Patterson, for whom he previously worked when he was in advertising.
Grabenstein has won the Agatha Award for Best Children's/Young Adult Novel four times: for The Crossroads, The Hanging Hill, The Black Heart Crypt, and Escape From Mr. Lemoncello's Library. He has also won the Anthony Award twice, once for Best First Novel for Tilt-A-Whirl and once for Best Children's/Young Adult Novel for The Crossroads.
