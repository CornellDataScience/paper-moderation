The Animals' Friend Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was an animal welfare organisation founded in 1832 by Lewis Gompertz and T. Forster. Along with the RSPCA, it was a pioneering organisation advocating for animal welfare in the United Kingdom. After Gompertz's retirement in 1846, the society disbanded. In 1910, an organisation of the same name was founded by Ernest Bell.


== History ==


=== Original society ===
Lewis Gompertz was one of the founding members of the RSPCA. After a dispute with them, Gompertz resigned and established the Animals' Friend Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals with his friend T. Forster, in 1832. It was headquarter at 18 West Strand, London. It's chief officer was T. B. Gibbins.
The Society was non-sectarian, while other animal organisations of the time were. By 1841, it had at least ten local branches and was experiencing financial difficulties. In 1844, the Society reported that since their formation they had prosecuted no less than 3143 cases of animal cruelty. A splinter group inspired by Christian ideals formed in 1844, known as the National Animals' Friend Society. In 1846, Gompertz retired due to ill health.


=== Regional branches ===
Independent regional branches of the Animals' Friend Society remained active up until 1880. John Cadbury was a supporter of the Birmingham branch which was active in the 1850s.
The Luton Animals' Friend Society was established in 1875. Louisa Bigg was its secretary.


=== Revival ===
An organisation with the same name was founded was in 1910 by Ernest Bell.: xv  It was headquartered at York House, Portugal Street, London.
Novelist and poet Thomas Hardy was a supporter of the revived society.

=== The Animals' Friend, or, the Progress of Humanity ===
The Society published an illustrated journal titled The Animals' Friend, or, the Progress of Humanity, between 1833 and 1841. It was edited by Gompertz. 


=== Animals' Friend ===
To expand George Bell & Sons humane education publishing line, Ernest Bell launched Animals' Friend (1894–1930), serving as its editor. In 1897, the journal introduced a Children's Supplement, later renamed Little Animals' Friend (1911–1944). In 1910, it became the official publication of the Animals' Friend Society, which, alongside Bell's company, developed additional titles and teaching resources.: 195
