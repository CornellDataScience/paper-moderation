Sega 3D Reprint Archives (Japanese: セガ3D復刻アーカイブス, Hepburn: Sega 3D Fukkoku Ākaibusu) is a series of video game compilations for Nintendo 3DS developed by M2 and published by Sega, each featuring enhanced versions of older Sega games with added stereoscopic 3D.
Many of the games included in the compilations in this series have also been released individually as 3D Classics.


== Development ==
Games in the series were developed by M2. Many of the Sega 3D Classics are remakes of games that originally used Sega's "Super Scaler" technology, which created a pseudo-3D effect by rapidly rotating and scaling large numbers of sprites.
Some of the Sega 3D Classics provide options that try to emulate the arcade experience, such as option to enable motion controls or show the screen tilt in games like After Burner II and Super Hang-On. 3D Sonic the Hedgehog allows players to switch between the Japanese and international versions of the game. Some Sega 3D Classics introduce new features altogether, such as "Super Dolphin" invincibility mode in Ecco the Dolphin and the Spin Dash in Sonic the Hedgehog (which is a technique originally introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 2).
The cover artwork for the collections was illustrated by Pokémon character designer Ken Sugimori.


== Release ==
Eight of the Sega 3D Classics comprised the retail title Sega 3D Reprint Archives, released on December 18, 2014, in Japan. It has not been released outside Japan, although the titles it is composed of were released on the Nintendo eShop internationally throughout 2013 and 2015 (all the component games had been released in Japan prior to the release of the compilation).
The second group of Sega 3D Classics were released in Japan starting in December 2013; in the West, they were released in 2015, with one of the five coming out each month. In Australia, after the release of 3D After Burner II, all remaining SEGA 3D Classics were delayed indefinitely; while many of the games were classified by the Australian Classification Board much earlier, they were not released in Australia until July 2, 2015.


== Reception of the series ==
The Verge's Sam Byford complimented the Sega 3D Classics for making stereoscopic 3D "a feature", calling the 3D Classics "the most impressive use of 3D on Nintendo's console to date". Byford also commented that the added depth perception makes some of the games easier to play.
GamesRadar's Justin Towell praised the conversion of Super Hang-On to stereoscopic 3D, but noted that the 3D effect seems "a bit uneven in the far distance", and criticized the optional screen-tilt feature (which attempts to emulate sitting on a bike in an arcade) as pointless. Towell complimented 3D Space Harrier for its various screen modes and control options (especially the touch screen mode), as well as the new time trial mode. He also enjoyed the CRT TV simulation displayed in 3D Sonic the Hedgehog and 3D Altered Beast, although he found the effect fuzzy in Altered Beast due to the slow pace.
