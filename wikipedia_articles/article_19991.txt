El Pueblo is a neighborhood in Wichita, Kansas, United States. A mixed commercial and residential area on the east bank of the Little Arkansas River, it is the cultural and historical center of the city’s Hispanic community.


== History ==

In the 1910s and 1920s, railroad workers recruited from Mexico settled the area along north Broadway Street called “the North End”. The area became Wichita’s first barrio and the seat of the local Mexican American community. The portion east of Broadway became known as El Huarache; the area west of Broadway and north of 21st Street became El Pueblo. In the following decades, immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America continued to settle in the neighborhood, bolstering and broadening its Hispanic character.
In recent years, community organizations have formed to both preserve the neighborhood’s heritage and encourage economic development. The area has become well-known locally for its Latin American restaurants and marketplace.
