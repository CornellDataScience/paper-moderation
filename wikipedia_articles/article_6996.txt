== Key activities and awards ==
Indigenous youth athletes between the ages of 13 years and 18 years try out for their provincial/territorial teams annually. Those individuals who make the team then participate in the annual NAHC as a member of their provincial/territorial team. Each team in the competition is competing against other provinces and territories from across Canada.
First, second, and third place finalists are all recognized in this tournament. Both the boys’ and girls’ division first place teams receive gold medals; the teams who place second in each division receive silver medals, while the teams who place third receive bronze medals. The gold medalist in each division is also presented with the Turtle Island Cup, a wooden carved trophy handcrafted by artist Carey Newman.
Individually, the tournament recognizes players in both the female and male division through awards. Most Valuable Goaltender, Most Valuable Forward, Most Valuable Defence, and Most Sportsmanlike Player awards are all handed out at the conclusion of the tournament. In addition, the Most Sportsmanlike Team is also recognized in each division as determined by the Aboriginal Sports Circle committee.


== Organizers ==
Hosting rights of this event is a result of a successful bidding process performed by provincial/territorial hockey associations. To be eligible, the bid must be approved by its Provincial/Territorial Aboriginal Sport Body (P/TASB). Only one community can bid per Province/Territory. Once selected, the hosting site works with the Aboriginal Sport Circle to coordinate the annual championship. Together they often recruit local volunteers to assist with preparation and execution of the event. Moreover, sponsors aid by providing funding and in-kind contributions for each annual event.
As a sanctioned Hockey Canada event, the NAHC are staged annually during the first two weeks in May. This ensures that the NAHC do not conflict with any of the Provincial/Territorial Bantam and Midget Hockey Championships.


== Cultural practices ==
The NAHC is a week-long event with opening ceremonies conducted on the first day and closing awards ceremonies conducted following the final Gold Medal Game. The championship begins with an opening ceremony that includes Indigenous cultural practices. Indigenous attire, music and dance are included in this ceremonial moment that ignites the beginning of the Championship. Additionally, the ceremony often includes an introduction of members of the host committee, special speakers, and VIP guests. All teams participating in the Championship are present during the opening ceremony.
