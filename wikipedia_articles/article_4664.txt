Oca (Latin Auca) is a former bishopric in the province of Burgos, Castile and León region (northern Spain), the predecessor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Burgos, and presently a Latin titular see of the Catholic Church. Its Latin adjective is Aucen(sis).


== Visigothic see ==
The diocese was established at Oca, now Villafranca Montes de Oca, no later than 589, when its bishop Asterius attended the Third Council of Toledo, but vaguer notices may trace it back as early as the 3rd century. Monastic life flourished there during the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo (6th–8th century).
However, in the 8th century, Arab Muslim invaders destroyed Oca, rendering its bishops errant, quoted by sources at Amaya, Valpuesta, Muñó, Sasamón, Oña, Gamonal, only to have their 'see' formally suppressed to restore definitively the Diocese of Burgos in 1075, confirmed by Pope Urban II in 1095.
