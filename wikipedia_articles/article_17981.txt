In June 1985, Billboard magazine established Tropical Albums (initially called Tropical/Salsa Latin Albums), a chart that ranks the best-selling tropical albums in the United States. The chart was published on a fortnightly basis with its positions being compiled by sales data from Latin music retailers and distributors. According to Billboard, tropical music is the "sound of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean – though it extends beyond it". In the 1980s, 17 albums topped the chart.
The first album to reach number one on the Tropical Albums chart was El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico's Innovations (1985). El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico was also the  act with the most number-one albums of the 1980s with five records in total. The 1980s saw the popularity of salsa romántica in the tropical field with artists such as Frankie Ruiz and Eddie Santiago as the movement's pioneers. Ruiz and Santiago were the only other artists with more than two number ones on the Tropical Albums chart during the 1980s. Ruiz had the best-selling tropical album of 1986 with his debut album as a soloist, Solista Pero No Solo (1985). Santiago achieved the same feat from 1987 to 1989 with his albums Atrevido y Diferente (1986), Sigo Atrevido (1987), and Invasión de la Privacidad (1988).
Lalo Rodríguez achieved his only number one on any Billboard chart with Un Nuevo Despertar (1988) which spawned the single "Ven, Devórame Otra Vez" and became a top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. Rodríguez won three Lo Nuestro Awards at the inaugural award ceremony in 1989 including Tropical Album of the Year, Tropical Song of the Year, and    Tropical Artist of the Year.  Luis Enrique had two number one albums on the chart with Amor y Alegría (1988) and Mi Mundo (1989). The latter was the final number one of the decade and also won Tropical Album of the Year at the following Lo Nuestro Awards.
