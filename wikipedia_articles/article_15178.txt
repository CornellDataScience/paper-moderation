Billy, joined by his friends Mandy, Devon, and Danny, continue their adventure from the previous movie. With the help of their magical professor, Mr. Thurgood, the children are still learning about their new powers. When the carnival comes to town, it's revealed that Professor Mould has used the children to trap the soul of Mr. Thurgood in a magical amulet. As the legend goes, inserting the amulet into the scepter will result in the unlocking of the magical powers of the scepter, and release the treasure of the god Loki.
