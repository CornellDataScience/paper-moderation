A review of Google Maps on 10 June 2018 shows that none of the former aerodrome remains.  It appears that the old taxiway and 13/31 runway are now occupied by housing and the remaining runways have been completely reclaimed for agriculture. The coordinates from the c.1942 publication appear to be slightly north of the actual location of the former airfield a more likely coordinate would be 50.461395°N 105.811784°W﻿ / 50.461395; -105.811784 based on the drawings in the reference.
