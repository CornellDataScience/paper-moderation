Bonoff has been a supporter of Minnesotacare, a partnership between private industry and government to provide health care to low-income families and individuals. To be enrolled in MinnesotaCare people must first apply and then pay what they can afford for health insurance. Bonoff has said, "Frankly, I thought our MinnesotaCare program and our subsequent reform efforts to enhance quality while keeping costs down should have been the backbone of the Affordable Care Act" and "Minnesota should establish a health insurance exchange that complies with the minimum requirements under federal law and provides exchange consumers the ability to shop based on provider quality as well as cost." In order to do that Bonoff has said the legislature should "evaluate the cost-effectiveness of new and existing health benefits and eliminate barriers to flexible, innovative insurance products, purchasing and finance options."


==== Education ====
Bonoff voted in favor of alternative teacher licensing (2012 SF 40, SJ 339). After her vote, she explained, "I would never support anything that threatens the integrity of the teaching profession... Alternative licensure is working. Those states -- there are 35 of them -- that have alternative licensure have strong records of the success."
Bonoff also voted in favor of teacher layoff reform (LIFO, 2012 SF 1690 SJ 3968). After that vote she explained, "School districts should use performance and not just seniority when making layoff decisions."

Voted in favor of the 2007 transportation finance bill, which increased the sales tax by .5%, and amounted to an increase in the gas tax by less than 7.5 cents/gallon (2007 HF 946).
Voted in favor of the business-supported sales tax from e-retailers with "affiliate nexus" (out-of-state sellers, 2011 SF 27 SJ 1192)


==== Voter ID ====
Bonoff authored a bill calling for voter verification, which would create a link between the Secretary of State's voting rolls and the Department of Motor Vehicles records (2012 SF 2555). This bill did not require a constitutional amendment.  
Bonoff voted against placing a constitutional amendment for voter ID on the ballot (2012 SF 1577/HF 2738 SJ 4938), against legislation requiring an ID to vote (2011 SF 509 SJ 1452), against attempts to eliminate the practice of "vouching" for others' identities at the polls (2010 SF 2388 SJ 7462), and against clarifying eligibility rules on the absentee ballot.(2010 SF 2622 SJ 7400).
