=== Symbolism ===
Shield
The shield is blue for Infantry.  The wavy fess symbolizes the Aisne River, where the regiment's outstanding achievements took place during World War I; it also symbolizes the Red River separating the States of Texas and Oklahoma, from which states were drawn the units composing the 142d Infantry, Texas Army National Guard – the 7th Texas and Machine Gun Company.  The church at St. Etienne, France, was in the sector where the regiment received its baptism of fire.  First Lieutenant Donald J. McLennan, D.S.C., scout officer of the 1st Battalion, 142nd Regiment Infantry, led a patrol across the Aisne River into the enemy country on 8 October 1918 and secured information of vast importance to the regiment.  As he returned, under heavy fire, to the south bank of the Aisne River with his patrol, he was the last man to cross and would not cross with his back to the enemy.  Instead, he backed across the foot-log, shaking his fist and shouting to the enemy "We’re going back, but I’ll face you."
The coat of arms was approved on 27 June 1928.
