The list of justice ministers of Prussia lists the Prussian ministers of justice from the founding of the General Directorate (General-Ober-Finanz-Kriegs-und Domainen-Direktorium) in 1723 until the completion of the federalization (Verreichlichung) of the Prussian justice system during the Gleichschaltung in 1935. The first officeholder was Christoph von Katsch (1723–1729) and the last caretaker of the office was Franz Gürtner (1934–1935).
The office thereby existed during very different political contexts for Prussia: From 1723 until 1806, while Prussia was – at least formally – part of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1806 until 1871 as an office of an independent Kingdom of Prussia. And from 1871 onward as an office of a state of the German Empire (the Free State of Prussia since 1918). The empire itself was a monarchy until its abolition in 1918, before it became the Weimar Republic and finally was transformed into Nazi Germany in 1933.
The German Empire had a separate federal State Secretary of Justice since 1876, who headed the Reichsjustizamt. In 1919 the federal office became known as the Reich Minister of Justice, who headed the Reich Ministry of Justice.


== History of the office ==
Modern ministerial administration began in Prussia under King Frederick William I. From around 1723, his five ministers each had responsibility for a province and specific areas. At the same time, three ministers were always given the role of Justice Minister; They could only make important decisions together. The main tasks were nominating judges, training of lawyers, administration of the judicial apparatus (buildings and personnel), registries (especially the land registers) and advising the king. This system was maintained until 1737 and was later temporarily reactivated.
Under King Frederick II, the systematic drafting of laws began. This task was given to a Grand Chancellor (also known as Senior Minister of Justice and Chef of Justice), newly created in 1747. At times, there was also ongoing administration in parallel by other justice ministers; especially under Grand Chancellor Jariges, who worked with four other ministers. Typical responsibilities of these additional justice ministers were the management of the Criminal Department, the Military Justice System or the Justice Administration as well as the supervision of the Provincial Justice System. From 1762 until the 19th century, "spiritual matters" (churches and education) were also part of the remit of the Justice Ministers (Zedlitz, Wöllner, Massow).

=== 1723–1737: Collegiate Principle ===
In 1723, the General Directorate (General-Ober-Finanz-Kriegs-und Domainen-Direktorium) was founded by Frederick William I. Originally the General Directorate had five departments; the first four had regional competencies, while the fifth department dealt with judicial matters from all Prussian regions and directed and (secretly) controlled the other departments. This department was headed by Katsch. He is generally regarded as the first minister of justice of Prussia.


=== 1737–1817: Ministers and Grand Chancellors ===
By cabinet decree (Kabinettsordre) dated 5 November 1737 Frederick William I reorganized the Prussian administration of justice and established Samuel von Cocceji as "Ministre Chef de Justice" who should inspect all aspects of the Prussian administration of justice. After the death of Frederick William I, Frederick the Great did not use the title "Ministre Chef de Justice" but left Cocceji in place and elevated his position to become the inaugural Prussian Grand Chancellor in 1747.

=== 1808–1848: Foundation of a modern Ministry of Justice and its separation into two entities ===
The modern Prussian Ministry of Justice was formally founded as an independent entity by cabinet decree on 25 November 1808 during the time of the Stein–Hardenberg Reforms. On 3 November 1817 the First Ministry of Justice for the Revision of Laws and for the Judicial Organisation of the new Provinces (Erstes Justizministerium zur Revision der Gesetzgebung und zur Justizorganisation der neuen Provinzen) was formed as a separate entity which would deal with the revision of Prussia's laws. This ministry was, however, quickly abolished again in December 1819. The business of judicial organisation was transferred to the Immediate Justice Organisation Commission in Berlin (Immediat-Justiz-Organisations-Kommission zu Berlin) and from 1823 onward all business was dealt with within one unified justice ministry. On 9 February 1832 the former idea of two separate entities was revived and by cabinet decree of the same date the Department for the Revision of Laws (Department für Gesetzesrevision) was formed, which also dealt with judicial business of the Rhine Province until 17 December 1838. From 1842 onward the department was again established as a separate and independent ministry (as the Ministry for the Revision of Laws [Ministerium für die Gesetzesrevision]); it was abolished in 1848.

=== 1848–1935: Prussian Ministry of Justice ===
During the time of the German revolutions of 1848–1849, both ministers of justice (Savigny and Uhden) resigned their portfolios in March 1848 and their ministries were headed by one minister. With a royal decree dated 1 September 1848, the Ministry for the Revision of Laws (Ministerium für die Gesetzesrevision) was formally abolished and its business transferred to the unified Prussian Ministry of Justice.
