=== January–March ===
8 January – Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin announces plans to build an airship capable of carrying 100 passengers.
13 January – Henri Farman wins the $10,000 Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for making the world's first circular flight of at least 1 km (0.62 mi) in a Voisin 1907 biplane.

They fly for a distance of approximately 600m in 28-3/5ths seconds in the Wright 1905 Flyer, modified with seats for pilot and passenger. Shortly after, Orville Wright flies Furnas for 4.12 km in 4 minutes 2-2/5ths seconds.
22 May – The Wright brothers register their airplane with the United States Patent Office.
31 May – Henry Farman is reported to have flown with a Mlle. P. Van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, daughter of the mayor of Desteldonk in Ghent, Belgium. She is the first woman passenger in an aeroplane.

=== July–September ===
The Royal Navy's Director of Naval Ordnance, Captain Reginald Bacon, recommends that the Royal Navy acquire an airship to compete with the Kaiserliche Marine's Zeppelins.
4 July – Glenn H. Curtiss is awarded the Scientific American trophy for being the first person in the United States to make a public flight of over 1 km (0.62 mi) in the AEA June Bug. The award is for a flight at Hammondsport in which he flies 1,550 m (5,090 ft) in 1 minute and 42 seconds.
8 July – Thérèse Peltier officially becomes the first woman to fly in an aeroplane. She is a passenger on a flight made by Léon Delagrange at Turin. However, this flight may not have been fully controlled. See also #May and #October.
8 August – Wilbur Wright makes his first flights at the Hunaudières racetrack at Le Mans, France. The Wright Flyer used for this and later flights had been shipped to Le Havre by Orville the previous year. It had been seriously damaged by custom officials when it arrived in France and was uncrated. Wilbur spent the whole summer of 1908 rebuilding the machine and getting it into flying condition. Wilbur's flights in this machine will have a profound effect on European aviation during the following months.
20 August – Robert Gastambide becomes the first passenger carried by a monoplane when he is taken up on the Antoinette II.
21 August
Wilbur Wright moves to Camp d'Auvours, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) east of Le Mans, where all his flights for the remainder of the year will be based.
The Antoinette II flies the first circle by a monoplane.
3 September – Seeking a contract to build the United States Army's first airplane, Orville Wright begins flight trials before Army observers at Fort Myer, Virginia, in a new Wright Model A flyer. The flight lasts 1 minute 11 seconds.
9 September – At Fort Myer, Orville Wright sets three world records: a flight endurance record of 57 minutes 13 seconds on his first flight, a new flight endurance record of 1 hour 2 minutes and 15 seconds on his second flight (the world's first airplane flight of over one hour), and an endurance record for a flight with a passenger (Army Lieutenant Frank P. Lahm) of 6 minutes 24 seconds on his third flight.

Wright is severely injured.
Thérèse Peltier makes a flight of 200 metres (660 feet) at a height of approximately 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) at the Military Square in Turin, Italy. Photos of Peltier with the aeroplane are published on 27 September. Unofficially, it is the first flight by a female aviator.
