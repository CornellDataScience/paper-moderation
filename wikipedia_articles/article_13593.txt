== History ==
St. Christopher Truckers Relief Fund was founded in 2007 by Dr. John McElligott, Dave Nemo, an American radio personality who hosts a show on Road Dog Trucking on Sirius XM Radio, and Michael Burns.
Sixty-one percent of long-haul truckers report having two or more of the following risk factors: hypertension, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, no physical activity, 6 or fewer hours of sleep per 24-hr period. Making things worse, thirty-eight percent of truck drivers are not covered by health insurance or a health care plan.
Drivers, who experience an injury or illness, may be at risk of losing their commercial drivers license and become unable to work, which may lead to financial hardship.
