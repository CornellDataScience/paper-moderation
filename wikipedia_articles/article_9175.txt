The 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan was a road and rail transport plan for Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia, instituted by Henry Bolte's state government. Most prominently, the plan recommended the provision of an extensive freeway network, much of which has since been built.
Despite the majority of the printed material being devoted to non-car transport, 86 per cent of the projected budget was devoted to roads and parking, with only 14 per cent to other forms of transport. The plan recommended 510 kilometres (320 mi) of freeways for metropolitan Melbourne, as well as a number of railways. Of the latter, only the City Underground Loop was constructed. Proposed lines to Doncaster and Monash University (now Clayton Campus), and between Dandenong and Frankston, were never built.
The plan was described by J.M. Thompson in Great Cities and their Traffic as "clearly ... a highway plan, not – as it is called – a comprehensive transport plan", and by historian Graeme Davison as "the most expansive and expensive freeway experiment in Australian history".
In 1973, some freeway plans were pruned, especially those proposed for the inner city, with State Premier Rupert Hamer cancelling all the road reservations for the unbuilt urban freeways in 1976.
Some significant outer suburban freeway projects, under new branding, were built by subsequent governments, including CityLink (by the Kennett government in the 1990s), EastLink (by the Bracks government in the 2000s) and Peninsula Link (by the Napthine government in the 2010s).


== Background ==

The plan consisted of three volumes:

Survey – completed for the Melbourne Transportation Committee by Wilbur Smith & Associates and Len T. Frazer & Associates
Parking – completed for the Melbourne Transportation Committee by Wilbur Smith & Associates and Len T. Frazer & Associates
The Transportation Plan – completed by the Melbourne Transportation Committee.
The scope of the plan specified surveys of vehicular and personal travel, transport facilities, goods movement by road and rail, and central city parking.  It built on the previous major Melbourne Transport Plans:

1929 Plan of General Development, Melbourne by the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission, and
1954 Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme by the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works
and the minor

1961 Metropolitan Street Service Study by Traffic Commission Victoria.


=== Goals ===
The goals of the plan were to:

ensure safe, comfortable and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the design area
maintain a proper balance between public and private transport
make maximum use of the existing facilities and plans and the commitments already embodied in these plans
provide a transport service matched to the expectant demand throughout the design area
provide a system that could be adapted to meet changing conditions and be expanded beyond the design year
provide a transport network which could be implemented with as little interference to the commercial and community structure as possible


=== Funding ===
The costs of the development of the plan were shared by the four participating authorities:

Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works
Victorian Railways Commissioners
Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board
Country Roads Board
Minor contributions were provided by Melbourne City Council and the Transport Regulation Board.


=== Methodology ===
The process adopted was:

Inventory of transport facilities, travel and developmental features of the study area
Forecast of 1985 travel requirements (estimated population of 3.7 million)
Evaluation of tentative 1985 plan
Periodic review


=== Organisation ===
The organisation required to develop the plan included:

Metropolitan Transportation Committee – a statutory body established in 1963 to advise government on all transport factors (and produce the third volume of the plan)
Technical Committee – consisting of senior representatives of transportation and other authorities on the main committee, its job was to oversee all technical matters arising during surveys and preparation of the plan
Consultants – Wilbur Smith and Associates (from New Haven, Connecticut) and Len T Frazer and Associates (Melbourne)
Study Group – engineers who were assigned from participating authorities to be trained by the consultants and assist in data collection and analysis This group was expanded to include economists responsible for costing the final plan


== Road ==

The plan proposed a budget of:

$1.675 billion for freeways
$64 million for divided arterial roads
$28 million on new arterial roads
$359 million on widening existing roads and bridges
$95 million for road/rail 80 grade separations


=== Major radial ===

F2 South Dingley Freeway - Partly built 1994–present, but not of freeway standard (Dandenong Bypass, South Road Extension and Westall Road Extension are part of the Dingley Arterial Project)
F4 East Calder Freeway (Originally passing through the Pascoe Vale Road Alignment to the F7 Freeway at Templestowe) - Abandoned

F18 Freeway (Originally to connect the Northern Ring Road at Greensborough to the Eastern Freeway at Manningham) - Abandoned (See North East Link)
F35 South Frankston Freeway - Built 1962-1973


=== Inner city bypasses ===
F9 Southern Bypass (Now known as CityLink), Built in 1997
F14 Western Bypass (Now known as CityLink), Built in 1997


=== Ring roads ===
F3/F5 Western Ring Road - Built 1992-1997
F5/F7 Northern Ring Road (Now known as the Metropolitan Ring Road), Partly Built 1996-1999
F35 North Scoresby Freeway/Eastern Ring Road (Now known as Eastlink), Built in 2008
A North East Link between the eastern and northern ring roads was originally designed but construction has begun as of 2020 with major works to begin mid 2021.


=== Parking ===
The plan included a proposed budget of $40 million for improvements in parking in the Melbourne central business district.


== Buses ==
The plan included a proposed budget $58 million for bus improvements:

$50 million for 2,540 new buses
$8 million for new bus depots


== Rail ==

The forecast budget for railway projects was $242 million. Planned rail projects included:

Melbourne Underground Rail Loop (estimated at $80 million and opened in stages from 1981)
Three new railway alignments and one extension (budgeted for $60 million):
Victoria Park - East Doncaster line (not built; now part of the PTV Network Development Plan)
Huntingdale - Ferntree Gully extension - Rowville Line (not built; now part of the PTV Network Development Plan)
Dandenong - Frankston line (not built)
Altona - Westona extension (built as part of the Altona - Laverton extension, opened 1985)
$8 million for extension of suburban electric service along existing lines to Werribee (completed 1983), Rockbank (electrification to Melton to come), Sunbury (completed to Sydenham in 2002, and Sunbury in 2012), Craigieburn (completed in 2007), Coldstream (line now closed), Hastings (not done) and Mornington (line now closed)
