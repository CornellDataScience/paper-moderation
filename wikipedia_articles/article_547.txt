This was the fifth consecutive win for Texas over Kansas State. With two field goals from Longhorn Cameron Dicker, Texas pulled ahead to win. The final score of the game was Texas 22, Kansas State 17.
Although Texas won the game and broke a six-game losing streak (its worst since 1956), they ended the season at 5 wins and 7 losses (3-6 in the conference) and were not bowl eligible. Kansas State's regular season record concluded at 7-5 (4-5 in conference), and the Wildcats were invited to the Texas Bowl to play LSU.
