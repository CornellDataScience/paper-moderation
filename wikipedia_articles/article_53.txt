Farrell Lines Incorporated is a U.S.-based shipping company founded in 1925. It operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maersk Line, Limited and specializes in roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) vessels. The company manages a fleet of three U.S. Flag ships, providing international ocean transportation services, primarily in support of the U.S. military. Farrell Lines participates in the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) Maritime Security Program (MSP) and the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA), contributing to U.S. national security and defense logistics.


== History ==
Farrell Lines was established in 1948, succeeding the American South African Lines (ASAL), which was founded in 1925 by James Augustine Farrell, president of U.S. Steel. Initially, the company operated as both a passenger and cargo line, providing regular service between New York City and South Africa, with stops in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), Mozambique. Its ships carried approximately 180 passengers alongside cargo. By 1948, the company was renamed Farrell Lines by James A. Farrell, Jr., and John J. Farrell, sons of its founder.
In 1965, Farrell Lines expanded its operations by acquiring the Australia-U.S. East Coast service from United States Lines. Around the same time, it ceased passenger services to focus exclusively on cargo transportation. The company continued to grow, transitioning to containerized cargo handling in the 1970s and acquiring additional shipping lines, including the West-Coast Australia Service of the Pacific Far East Line in 1975. By 1978, Farrell Lines had become the second-largest U.S.-flag merchant fleet, operating 44 ships, including two container ships under construction at Bath Iron Works.
However, financial difficulties in the 1980s forced the company to reduce its fleet significantly. Farrell Lines dropped its African and European routes, selling 38 of its 44 ships. By 1991, it operated with only four vessels, focusing on routes in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf.


=== Farrell Lines International ===
Farrell Lines International, a Liberian subsidiary of Farrell Lines Inc., operated from the 1950s until the outbreak of the First Liberian Civil War in 1988. Its feeder fleet of four coastal vessels—M/V Kpo, M/V Farmington, M/V Cestos, and M/V Cavalla—provided essential supplies to Firestone Natural Rubber plantations and transported cargo to remote areas via Liberian National Airways. These ships were specifically designed for the challenging conditions of West African coastal waters and rivers, contributing to the region's supply chain.


=== Sale and Revitalization ===
In 2000, Farrell Lines was acquired by P&O Nedlloyd Container Line Ltd., which was subsequently purchased by the A.P. Møller-Maersk Group in 2005. Under Maersk Line, Limited—the U.S. flag operating arm of Maersk—Farrell Lines reemerged as a roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) carrier. The Farrell Lines brand was revitalized in 2010, and the fleet was increased to four vessels.


=== Current Operations ===
Farrell Lines currently operates in partnership with Höegh Autoliners and its U.S.-based affiliate Alliance Navigation. The company focuses on routes between the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. East Coast, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia. It participates in the Maritime Security Program (MSP) and the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA), which support the U.S. Department of Defense by ensuring readiness for emergency deployments.
