Songbird is the twentieth studio album by American singer Barbra Streisand, released in 1978. The title track reached number 25 on the Hot 100 and spent two weeks atop the adult contemporary chart. The album also includes Streisand's solo version of "You Don't Bring Me Flowers". She also subsequently re-recorded the song as a duet with Neil Diamond and this version topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two non-consecutive weeks in December 1978.
In the United States the album has been certified Platinum for sales of 1,000,000 copies. Streisand received the award at a convention held by CBS, in Los Angeles.
