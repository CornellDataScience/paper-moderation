Golden–Kilfeacle GAA club is located in the parish of Golden, five miles from Cashel in County Tipperary, Ireland. The club plays hurling and Gaelic football and is one of the few clubs in West Tipperary to win both the West Tipperary Senior Hurling and Football Championships. The club was known in the past as the Golden Fontenoys, named in memory of the Franco-Irish army soldiers who took the field at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. Inter-county player William "Bill" O'Donnell played with the Fontenoys in the 1930s. He later transferred to Éire Óg Annacarty, where he was headmaster of the school in Annacarty. O'Donnell was a member of the Tipperary team that won the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship in 1937 when the final was played in Killarney.
Other inter-county players include Joe Fogarty in the 1960s, Ned O'Donnell in the 1970s, John Looby who was a minor of inter-county fame in the same decade and in more recent times.
The club's most successful hurling team was that of a period in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the West Tipperary Divisional Senior hurling Championship was won after 35 years of not winning. The first victory was recorded in 1969, and again in 1972, which was the last occasion the club took the laurels. A football resurgence took hold in the 1980s and 1990s when in a ten-year period, four Divisional Senior Football Championships were won by the club, and a fifth was won jointly with Rockwell Rovers under the name of Golden-Rockwell.
