Sajek Valley (Bengali: সাজেক উপত্যকা) is a popular tourist spot in Bangladesh, situated among the hills of the Kasalong range of mountains in the northern area of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Referred to as the "Queen of Hills" and the "Roof of Rangamati", the valley is known for its greenery and dense forests, situated at an elevation of 1,800 feet (550 m) above sea level.


== History ==
The designation of Sajek Valley is derived from the Sajek River, which originates from the Karnaphuli River. Previously considered one of the most remote regions due to its challenging steep terrains and lack of significant economic activity, the valley has settlements dating back to 1885. Tourism commenced in early 2010's, following the establishment of a road network connecting the valley to the rest of the country. The construction of this road was undertaken by the Bangladesh Army and took approximately 10 years to complete. As of 2020, there are 83 registered resorts in the region, up from six in 2016. In 2020, tourism was temporarily halted for five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
