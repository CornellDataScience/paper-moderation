== Professional career ==


=== Pre-draft ===
Coming out of Clemson, Bryant was projected to be drafted anywhere from the second to fourth round by the majority of NFL analysts and scouts. Bryant received an invitation to the NFL Combine and completed all the required combine drills and positional drills for team representatives and scouts. On March 6, 2014, he participated at Clemson's Pro Day and chose to only perform positional drills. He was ranked as the 14th best wide receiver prospect available in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com and was ranked the 13th best wide receiver by NFL analyst Mike Mayock.


=== Pittsburgh Steelers ===


==== 2014 season ====
The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Bryant in the fourth round (118th overall) of the 2014 NFL draft. He was the 19th wide receiver selected. On June 9, 2014, he signed a four-year contract with the team worth $2.659 million, with $439,220 guaranteed and a $439,220 signing bonus.
Bryant spent the first six weeks of the season inactive, due to a shaky training camp and preseason, in addition to suffering a mild A/C sprain in the last preseason game. Head coach Mike Tomlin told Bryant he wanted to see him dominate the scout team in practice before he would activate him for a game. Bryant was finally activated for a Week 7 matchup against the Houston Texans. His first NFL reception went for a 35-yard touchdown, and he finished the game with two catches for 40 yards. On October 26, he hauled in a season-high five catches for 83 yards with two touchdowns in a 51–34 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. On November 2, Bryant received his first career start against the Baltimore Ravens, ending the game with three receptions, 44 receiving yards, and two touchdown receptions. His five touchdown receptions set an NFL record for a player in their first three games. During a Week 10 contest against the New York Jets, Martavis had four receptions for a season-high 143 yards, and had an 80-yard touchdown catch. This marked his sixth touchdown in his first four games, and again set an NFL record (which was later tied by Calvin Ridley.)
On December 28, Bryant caught a 21-yard touchdown reception in a 27–17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. He played in his first NFL postseason game on January 3, 2015, against the Ravens. He finished with five receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown in a 17–30 loss.
Bryant finished his rookie season with 26 receptions for 549 receiving yards and eight touchdowns, in ten games with three starts. Bryant's 21.1 yards-per-reception ranked first among NFL wide receivers in 2014.


==== 2015 season ====

On August 27, 2015, Bryant was suspended the first four games due to violating the league's substance abuse policy. During his suspension, he spent time at a rehabilitation center in Houston, Texas, and worked with ex-NBA coach John Lucas. Although he was available to return for Week 5, he missed the game due to a knee injury, so he made his season debut on October 18. In a 25–13 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, he caught six passes for 137 yards and two touchdowns, including an 88-yard touchdown. His first start of the season was on October 25 against the Kansas City Chiefs, where he caught three receptions for 45 yards and a touchdown. During a Week 10 matchup against the Cleveland Browns, Bryant had a season-high 178 receiving yards on six catches, while also scoring a 64-yard touchdown. On December 13, he caught a season-high seven receptions for 49 yards, in a 33–20 victory over the Bengals. In Week 15, he made a season-high ten catches for 87 yards in a 34–27 win over the Denver Broncos. This was the first time in his career that he caught over nine passes in a single game.
On January 9, 2016, against the Bengals in the Wild Card Round, while in the red zone, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger threw a pass into the corner of the end zone, which was intended for Bryant. During the process of the catch, he did a front flip and maintained control of the ball while holding it on the back of his leg throughout the flip. The NFL VP of officiating later deemed this should not have been ruled a catch. This score gave the Steelers a 15–0 lead en route to winning the game by a score of 18–16. In the Divisional Round against the Broncos, Bryant made nine receptions for 154 yards, while rushing for 40 yards, in a 23–16 defeat.


==== 2016 season ====
On March 14, 2016, the NFL announced it had suspended Bryant for the entire 2016 NFL season for again violating the league's substance abuse policy.


==== 2017 season ====
On April 25, 2017, Bryant was conditionally reinstated by the NFL. He entered the regular season as the starting wide receiver alongside Antonio Brown. In the Steelers' season-opening victory against the Browns, Bryant caught two passes for 14 yards. The following week, he caught three passes for 91 receiving yards and his first touchdown of the season on a 27-yard pass from Ben Roethlisberger as the Steelers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 26–9. However, following the Week 7 game against the Bengals, Bryant vented frustration about his lack of role in the offense on social media, and then skipped mandatory team meetings the following Monday. Bryant then publicly told ESPN he would like to be traded; however, coach Mike Tomlin said the team had no plans to trade Bryant. On October 25, 2017, prior to that week's game against the Detroit Lions, the Steelers demoted Bryant to the scout team and replaced him with JuJu Smith-Schuster after deactivating him for the game. As of November 1, 2017, Bryant was promoted back onto the first-team for the following game against the Colts.
Bryant finished the 2017 season with 50 receptions for 603 yards and three touchdowns. The Steelers made the playoffs and faced off against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Divisional Round. In the 45–42 loss, he had two receptions for 78 yards and a touchdown.

On September 1, 2018, Bryant was released by the Raiders. Despite facing a possible year-long suspension by the NFL for a violation of the league's drug policy during the off-season, the Raiders re-signed him to a one-year deal ten days later. He played in eight games, recording 19 catches for 266 yards and no touchdowns, before being placed on injured reserve on December 5, 2018, with a knee injury. On December 14, 2018, the NFL suspended Bryant indefinitely for violating the terms of his conditional reinstatement. Bryant applied for reinstatement in 2019.
