Davis suffered massive blood loss, a concussion, traumatic brain injury, two broken forearms, right broken knee, broken nose, broken facial bones and a broken toe on his right foot. After numerous surgeries to repair his body to include a spinal fusion, the decision was made to amputate his left leg above the knee.
