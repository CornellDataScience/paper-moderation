== Organ ==
The church was presented with a new organ by Herbert Austin, 1st Baron Austin and Lady Austin in memory of 2nd Lieutenant Vernon James Austin, who had died in 1915. It was built by the Compton Organ Company and opened on 22 March 1937. It comprises three manuals and pedals and is built on the extension principle. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.


== Stained Glass Windows ==
The beautiful depth of colour and ornate designs of the windows are masterpieces contributed to the work of Hardman & Co.  They also designed and made stained glass windows for St. Andrew's Cathedral and St. Mary's Cathedrals in Sydney, Australia as well as for the Houses of Parliament in London, including a window in the House of Lords'.  Almost all of the windows in this historic Church of St. Laurence are by Hardman, replicating 13th-century stained-glass designs accurately through expert techniques and attention to detail.  Hardman's windows include the subjects of: The Passion of Christ, The Resurrection, The Adoration, The Nativity, The Presentation in the temple before Simeon, The Annunciation, The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, Our Lord's appearance to St. Thomas, The Transfiguration, Walking on the waters of the Sea of Galilee, Raising of Lazarus, to name but a few.  There is also a window by Pugin and Kempe.
The church tower and the Chancel date back to the 12th/13th century AD.  There is a Lady Chapel dedicated in the South Aisle and a chapel dedicated to St. Laurence in the North Aisle.  The site of this Norman church was probably the previous location of a Saxon church as a priest was mentioned here in "Nordfeld" in the Domesday Book of 1086.


== War Graves ==
The churchyard extension, which lies between Kings Norton and Bristol Road, contains war graves of sixteen service personnel, one of World War I and fifteen of World War II.
