The 2002–03 NBA season was the 57th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. During the off-season, the Celtics acquired Vin Baker and Shammond Williams from the Seattle SuperSonics, and signed free agent and undrafted rookie J.R. Bremer. The Celtics posted a six-game winning streak after losing their first two games, and got off to a solid 16–7 start, holding a 27–22 record at the All-Star break. At midseason, Williams was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for former Celtics center Mark Blount. However, the Celtics lost six straight games in March, and finished third in the Atlantic Division with a 44–38 record. The team made the playoffs for the second time with team captain Paul Pierce, but this time as the #6 seed in the Eastern Conference.
Pierce averaged 25.9 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.4, assists and 1.8 steals per game, and was named to the All-NBA Third Team, while Antoine Walker averaged 20.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.5 steals per game. Pierce and Walker were both selected for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. In addition, Tony Delk contributed 9.8 points per game, while Eric Williams provided the team with 9.1 points and 4.7 rebounds per game,  Bremer contributed 8.3 points per game and was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team, and Tony Battie provided with 7.3 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.
After defeating the 3rd-seeded Indiana Pacers four games to two in the Eastern Conference First Round, the Celtics were unable to stop the New Jersey Nets as they were swept in four straight Eastern Conference Semi-final games. The Nets would reach the Finals for the second consecutive year, but would lose in six games to the San Antonio Spurs. This was also Walker's final season with the Celtics, as he was traded along with Delk to the Dallas Mavericks the following offseason. He would return to Boston midway during the 2004–05 season. Also following the season, Bremer was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The franchise gained new owners that season when Paul Gaston sold the team to the Boston Basketball Partners, represented by Wyc Grousbeck, in the fall of 2002.
