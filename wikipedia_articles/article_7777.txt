In 2008, Gower expressed his desire to play rugby union for Italy. He qualified for the 'Azzurri' due to his Italian grandfather. On 13 June 2009, Gower made his first appearance for Italy at fly-half against Australia after being selected for the mid-season tour of Australia and New Zealand. Italy coach Nick Mallett had initial reservations about selecting Gower.


== Return to rugby league ==
Following the expiry of his union contract, Gower returned to rugby league, signing a 2-year contract with the London Broncos of the Super League starting in 2012.
As a result, he did not feature in Italy's 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign, and was instead selected in the Italy rugby league squad for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup qualifying tournament, although he missed all three matches due to injury. On 14 November 2012, Gower extended his Broncos contract by a year, making him a Bronco until the end of 2014. He was then named captain, although he stood down as captain in May.
In June 2013, Gower gained a release from his Broncos contract to return to Australia and negotiate a contract with National Rugby League club the Newcastle Knights. On 8 June 2013, Gower signed a contract with the Knights for the remainder of the 2013 NRL season.
Gower was named in the Italy squad for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup. However he did not play due to the injury he suffered at the end of the 2013 NRL season.
At the end of the 2013 NRL season, Gower announced his retirement due to injury.
On 25 June 2016, Gower was inducted into the Penrith Panthers hall of fame alongside Grahame Moran, Royce Simmons, and Greg Alexander.


== Controversies ==
Gower has been involved in a number of alcohol-related off-field incidents. In 1999, Gower exposed himself to a female Irish tourist in a Coogee bar, blaming his behaviour on alcohol intoxication. He was dumped from the squad and fined A$2,500 by the NRL and a further A$500 in court after pleading guilty to indecent exposure.
In December 2005, Gower was fired as Panthers captain after incidents at a charity golf event where he argued with several guests, groped the then teenage daughter of former league player Wayne Pearce, chased Mitchell Pearce with a bottle before vomiting on him, streaked nude around the resort, stole and crashed a golf cart, held a butter knife to the throat of a Sydney radio personality before throwing it at resort guests, and engaged in a brawl with resort security before being ejected from the official function and detained by police. He was handed a "final warning" by the National Rugby League and fined A$100,000, with A$90,000 to be paid to an NRL programme encouraging the responsible use of alcohol by league players and $10,000 to replace the destroyed golf cart. Gower was "deeply unhappy" that the Penrith Panthers club did not defend his reputation, and at one stage threatened to "walk" from the club.
Allegedly inebriated with alcohol in a bar at Kings Cross on 11 February 2007, Gower allegedly tried to kiss one man before biting him on the neck and sparking a brawl, and is accused of assaulting another man. The Panthers club controversially reappointed Gower as captain in 2007, claiming the Peppermint Lounge incident was just a media "beat-up". Australian swimmer Dawn Fraser said Gower was unfit to be captain, due to his alleged lewd behaviour at the charity golf event which she attended, and Sarah Maddison, spokesperson for the Women's Electoral Lobby, said "reappointing Craig Gower would send all the wrong messages."
