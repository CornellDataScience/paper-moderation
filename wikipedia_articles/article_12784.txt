HLA-DQ6 (DQ6) is a human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-DQ (DQ) serotype group. The serotype is determined by the antibody recognition of β6 subset of DQ β-chains. The β-chain of DQ isoforms are encoded by HLA-DQB1 locus and DQ6 are encoded by the HLA-DQB1*06 allele group. This group currently contains many common alleles, DQB1*0602 is the most common.  HLA-DQ6 and DQB1*06 are almost synonymous in meaning. DQ6 β-chains combine with α-chains, encoded by genetically linked HLA-DQA1 alleles, to form the cis-haplotype isoforms. For DQ6, however, cis-isoform pairing only occurs with DQ1 α-chains. There are many haplotypes of DQ6.

== Alleles ==


=== DQB1*0601 ===
DQB1*0601 is generally linked to DQA1*0103 as 6.1 haplotype. This haplotype is more common in Japan and other parts of East Asia.


=== DQB1*0602 ===
DQB1*0602 is commonly linked to DQA1*0102 to form 6.2 haplotype. DQ6.2 and is common from Central Asia into Western Europe, *0602 is also linked to DQA1*0103 in parts of Asia.


=== DQB1*0603 ===
DQB1*0603 is commonly linked to DQA1*0103 as 6.3 and is common from Central Asia into Western Europe, *0603 is also linked to DQA1*0102 in parts of Asia. In Europe it is most common in the Netherlands.


=== DQB1*0604 ===
DQB1*0604 is found at higher frequencies in parts Africa and Asia and is linked almost exclusively to DQA1*0102 as 6.4. This haplotype is found at its highest Eurasian frequencies in Japan.


=== DQB1*0609 ===
DQB1*0609 is found in Africa and proximal regions of Eurasia.


== Haplotypes and disease ==
Susceptibility to Leptospirosis infection was found associated with undifferentiated DQ6. Whereas DQ6 was protective against death (or need for liver transplantion) in primary sclerosing cholangitis.


=== DQ6.1 ===
DQA1*0103:DQB1*0601 (DQ6.1) is found at increased frequencies in Asia and is almost
absent in Western Europe. It confers protection from narcolepsy, juvenile diabetes, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, pemphigus vulgaris, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis.


=== DQ6.2 ===
DQ6.2 (DQA1*0102 : DQB1*0602) is commonly linked to DR15 and as such is part of the HLA B7-DR15-DQ6 haplotype. This haplotype is considered to be the longest multigene haplotype known within the human genome as it covers over 4.7 million nucleotides.  The DR15-DQ6.2 haplotype is the most common DR-DQ haplotype in Europe, and approximately 30% of Americans carry at least DQ6.2. The haplotype is even more common in Central Asia.


==== DQ6.2 associations with disease ====
For myasthenia gravis, recognition α34-49 of AChR  increased with DQ6.2.  DQA1*0102 increases risk cervical cancer. In multiple sclerosis DQA1*0102 was the most frequent allele and DQB1*0602 increased significantly in the MS patients.


==== Protective effects of DQ6.2 ====
In primary biliary cirrhosis DQ6.2 appears to have a negative association with disease. DQ6.2 also appears to have a protective effect in juvenile diabetes. DQ6.2 is also protective against infantile spasms in mestizos.


=== DQ6.3 ===
DQ6.3 (DQA1*0103 : DQB1*0603) is found in northcentral Europe at moderate frequencies, it is a protective against many autoimmune diseases. It also affords some protection to HIV infection.


=== DQ6.4 ===
DQ6.4 (DQA1*0102 : DQB1*0604) might be associated with thymoma-induced myasthenia gravis.
