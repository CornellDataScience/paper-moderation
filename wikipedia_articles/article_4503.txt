In October 1980, Miley signed with reigning Úrvalsdeild karla champions Valur. In his debut, he scored 14 points in Valur's overtime victory against ÍS. For the season, Miley averaged a team high 19.7 points in 17 games but Valur failed to repeat as champions.

Miley spent the 1982 NBL season with the Geelong Cats where he averaged 7.6 points and 10.1 rebounds in 28 games. The Cats finished with the second best record in the league and lost to the West Adelaide Bearcats in the NBL finals.
He returned to the Úrvalsdeild in November 1982 when he signed as player-coach with newly promoted Keflavík, replacing Tim Higgins. His first game for Keflavík was against Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur where his matchup against former teammate Pétur Guðmundsson was highly anticipated.

After 19 games, Keflavík and Valur were tied at the top with a 14–5 record. Incidentally, they faced each other in the last game of the season. In the game, Keflavík lost 88-87 after a controversial three second violation was called on Miley with few seconds left in the game. After the season he finished as the runner-up to Tim Dwyer for the Úrvalsdeild Foreign Player of the Year award.
He returned to Keflavík for the 1983–1984 season, this time only as the head coach as foreign players had been barred from playing in the Icelandic leagues during the summer. Without Miley playing, Keflavík was unable to reproduce its previous season's success and ended last in the league and were relegated to 1. deild karla.
