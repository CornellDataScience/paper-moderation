During his career, Bešić has been deployed as a right-back and as a centre-back, although his natural position in his own words is defensive midfielder.
He was described by then Everton manager Roberto Martínez as a "very complete footballer", who "has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he's a technical player on the ball."

Bešić has three children with his long-time girlfriend Jessica, two daughters and one son.
He is a practising Muslim; together with international teammates Ibrahim Šehić, Armin Hodžić, Izet Hajrović, Sead Kolašinac, Edin Višća and Ervin Zukanović he visited a mosque in Zenica during the national team's concentration.
