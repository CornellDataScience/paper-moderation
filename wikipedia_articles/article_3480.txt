Pos Allazei O Kairos (Greek: Πως Αλλάζει Ο Καιρός; English: How The Weather Changes) is the fifteenth studio album by Greek artist Katy Garbi. It was released on 23 October 2006 by Sony BMG Greece and received gold certification, selling over 20,000 units*. The album is her only album to carry a modern laika genre throughout its complete track listing, and this did not incorporate her past pop and dance genre which were found to be successful in previous releases, containing many of her most successful songs, like "Afti", "Pos Allazei O Kairos", "Ta Paidika Sou Matia" and "Isovios Desmos". It is her only album to date to carry the RCA Records logo as an imprint, as all of her past releases were under the Columbia imprint. The album did not turn out to be a smash hit for Garbi, but was able to chart for weeks on the Greek Albums Chart peaking at number 5. It was also certified gold the following year, and its title track has been announced as the 8th most successful Greek airplay track of the 2000s on Alpha's Chart Show Countdown. It was promoted in some way in the series Epta Thanasimes Petheres of Mega Channel, where she portrayed the main character of a 3-episode story.
* In 2006, gold was the album whose sales exceeded 15,000 units.
