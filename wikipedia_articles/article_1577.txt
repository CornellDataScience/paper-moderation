The Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards was first announced in May 2007. It is the first ever Kids' Choice Awards for the UK Nickelodeon. The show was hosted at ExCeL Exhibition Centre, London which took place 20 October 2007 and was presented by pop band McFly.
The Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards is very similar to the Australian and American versions, kids get to vote by clicking on the Nickelodeon website. Whoever voted on the website had a chance to get tickets to attend the ceremony in London. Also, another competition was held about "Nickelodeon's Big Green Thing"; people who went online and did what the commercial told them to do could also win a family ticket for 4 to the ceremony.
