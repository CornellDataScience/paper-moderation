Ramin (Ron) Najafi (Persian: رامین نجفی) is an Iranian-American businessman and the Founder and CEO of Emery Pharma. He is the Founder and former CEO of NovaBay Pharmaceuticals.
Najafi was born in Tehran, in 1958. He completed his primary education and received his high school diploma from Alborz High School in Tehran. In 1976, he emigrated to the United States to pursue his passion of becoming a chemist. He began his undergraduate degree in pharmacy at the University of Pittsburgh, and earned both a B.S. and M.S. in chemistry under the guidance of Professor John Soderquist at the University of San Francisco. He then received his Ph.D. at UC Davis under the tutelage of Professor (Emeritus) George Zweifel[i]. Post-Ph.D., He worked at Sigma-Aldrich, Rhone Poulenc Rorer (now Sanofi), and PerkinElmer-Applied Biosystems before leaving to found CP Lab Safety and NovaBay Pharmaceuticals.
Najafi is an innate innovator with more than 50 patents and pending patent applications, including a class of non-antibiotic, antimicrobial compounds named Aganocides®. The leading molecule of this aganocide family of compounds, auriclosene, has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Auriclosene is chemically stable and has an extremely low probability of developing resistance. NovaBay is developing a formulation of Auriclosene to be used against eye, skin, and urinary tract infections. These products are currently in FDA monitored clinical trials. The products are intended to replace current classical antibiotics used in eye, skin, and urinary tract infections. Ron Najafi championed development of NeutroPhase for wound care.  In September 2013, working together with John Crew, MD (vascular surgeon) they developed Crew-NovaBay minimally invasive surgical procedure to treat flesh eating bacteria.  NeutroPhase has been successfully used in over 40 cases diagnosed as flesh eating infection.  NeutroPhase has shown in a number of critical scientific publications to neutralize the key toxins responsible for the flesh eating disease. In 2014, Ron Najafi and his sister, Kathryn Najafi, MD (Ophthalmologist & Surgeon) discovered a unique formulation of NeutroPhase to help manage patients with Blepharitis.  This unique formulation was initially called i-Lid Cleanser and later changed name to Avenova. Avenova is now the leading product for the management of Blepharitis, MGD and Dry Eye. 
Najafi currently heads Emery Pharma located in Alameda, California.


== Early life and education ==
Najafi immigrated to the United States in 1976, before the Iranian Revolution.  At University of San Francisco, he earned a B.S. and M.S. in chemistry in Dr. John Soderquist's laboratory, and then received his Ph.D. at the University of California at Davis under Dr. George Zweifel.  He worked at Sigma-Aldrich, Rhone Poulenc, and PerkinElmer before leaving to found Calpac Labs (now CP Lab Safety), NovaCal Pharmaceuticals (now NovaBay Pharmaceuticals), and Emery Pharma.


== Awards and recognition ==
Najafi is among the U.S. State Department's "List of Prominent Iranian Americans."
Najafi was recognized by PharmaVoice 100 as one of 100 most influential leaders of 2008.  He is a tenacious leader and innovative developer of new molecules recognized for creating a paradigm shift in how antibiotics are used. He is an inventor on more than 50 patents & pending patents applications, including a class of non-antibiotic, antimicrobial compounds named Aganocides.  The lead molecule, Auriclosene  has broad spectrum of activity against bacteria (Wang 2011), viruses (Yoon 2011), and fungi (Ghannoum 2013), is chemically stable (Wang 2008), and has extremely low probability of developing resistance (D'Lima 2012).  Currently, auriclosene is in four clinical trials for treatment of adenoviral conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, impetigo and urinary catheter blockage and encrustation (Gottardi 2013).
