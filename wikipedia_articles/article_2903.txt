Demography of the Tees Valley or Teesside metropolitan area of England is recorded with differing definitions. The area's fragmented data into different area definitions every other census after 1971 has meant a lack of clear lineal correlation analysis and anachronistic data.
The first recording of the multiple towns in the area with combined statistics was the 1971 census, during the 1968â€“1974 borough of Teesside's existence. By the 1981 and 1991 censuses the borough had been split into three (Middlesbrough, Stockton-On-Tees and what is now known as Redcar and Cleveland) with the additional Borough of Hartlepool to form the County of Cleveland for the combined statistical data of the area. For the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the county had been abolished with an area recorded (between the size of the Teesside borough and the three replacement boroughs) as an urban area and built-up area respectively. The former county's four boroughs and the Borough of Darlington are now recorded as the Tees Valley Combined Authority mayoral area which was created in 2016 with its first census in 2021.

The newly formed Tees Valley Combined Authority encompasses 678,000 people and an area of 795 square kilometres (307 sq mi) over its 5 borough councils.


== Population ==


=== Modern ===
This is using reliable and government given statistics, both as combined data and broken down to Unitary Area divisions.


=== Historical ===
The following information cannot be easily compared to the modern data, due to the fact that the administrative areas of the modern districts do not fully map to that of historical land divisions, meaning the population estimates for before 1981 must be taken with this context.
The University of Portsmouth mapped out historic data from 1801 to 1911, using modern Unitary Area land divisions to try and create estimates for what the population for each borough was like. The created estimates cannot be described as accurate, but use the non profit organisation UK Data Service's collection of sources, specifically the GBHDB.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
The 1911 Preliminary Census Report, was a short summary of the changes in populations of the UK. In the section for towns, the settlements of Middlesbrough, Stockton, and Darlington are mentioned with details about their overall population change.


== Religion, Language and Identity ==


=== Religion ===
The religious statistics for 2021 for the Tees Valley Combined Authority, were released in the December 2022 statistics. For the area, the largest recorded group were Christian (50.7%), followed by None Religious (39.0%), the third largest was No Answer (5.2%), those identifying as Muslim came fourth (3.8%). The rest of the categories were all less than 1%, and so approximations of their total size may be inaccurate due to accuracy loss. Those identifying as Hindu were the fifth largest (0.5%), followed by equal percentages for Buddhist, Sikh and 'Other Religion'. Those identifying as Jewish recorded less than 0.1%, so the recorded number is unknown.
