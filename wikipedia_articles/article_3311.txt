In June 2007 he was asked by Gordon Brown to chair the party's manifesto group on housing, a position which he declined to take up. Following the cabinet reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Trickett became the Parliamentary private secretary to the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.

In September 2024, Trickett was the only MP from the Labour Party to vote for a parliamentary motion which would block the Labour government's plan to means test the Winter Fuel Payment for pensioners, becoming part of the significant backlash to it, arguing that this reform would lead to a further increase in poverty among pensioners during the coming winter, which he warned would be "extremely difficult for my constituents of all ages". Trickett had supported the introduction of the payment as a universal benefit to pensioners, by Labour chancellor Gordon Brown in 1997.
