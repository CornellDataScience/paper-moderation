== History ==


=== Member backgrounds ===
Johnny Atar was born on December 1, 1989, to an Israeli Jewish family in Manhattan, New York. His parents worked at the ministry of foreign affairs, and Atar was raised in many different parts of the world. Finally, in 2005, they moved to Toronto, which is where Atar had met Emmanuel in 2006. In 2010, Atar and his family retired to Miami.
Mark Emmanuel was born on December 20, 1989, to a Russian Jewish family in Krasnodar, USSR (presently known as Russia). His family moved to Israel shortly after in 1990. In 2004, Emmanuel and his family moved to Toronto, Canada. Later on, in 2006, Johnny and Mark met, and later formed Klaypex.


=== Founding ===
Atar and Emmanuel previously lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from 2005 to 2011. They became friends in 2006 and began writing together  in 2007. They started out with an Alternative Rock project (Pulsar), writing music in Guitar Pro, which later, in 2008, was recorded in GarageBand.
In early 2009, they began taking music production more seriously, and worked to improve Pulsar. During the summer of 2010, Atar and his family moved, forcing Pulsar to split up. For the majority of the winter of 2010, Emmanuel studied independent music production in Toronto while focusing on a pop project with a producer he had met. During that time, Atar focused all of his attention on making tracks and polishing his production skills, writing industrial, R&B, hip hop, electro house, acoustic, and rock music.
In 2010, Atar flew back to Toronto to work with Emmanuel and his fellow producer. The trio had moved the pop project, 1UP, to Miami to continue production. During the time in Miami, the band recorded two singles, one of which was released. During the second quarter of 2011, the band moved back to Toronto. During that time, the three had a falling out, and 1UP broke up.
Atar and Emmanuel then sought to continue writing music, and decided to take on producing electronic music. After a few months of refining their sound, Klaypex was formed.

=== 2013-14 ===
Klaypex has received attention due to their collaboration with YouTube channels Corridor Digital & DUBSTEP GUNS video. Klaypex initially contacted Mike Diva to inquire about a possible music video to accompany the release of Loose Dirt. They sent him bits and pieces of the EP. During that time, Mike Diva was planning a video collaboration with Corridor Digital, and at one point showed them some of the tracks. They had the idea for DUBSTEP GUNS, and the concept was later filmed and released. The video includes a mix of four of Klaypex's original tracks, "Lights", "Rain", "Hit Me" and "Chinter's Will", custom edited to fit the video.
In April 2013, Klaypex collaborated with YouTube channel Epic Meal Time on a video called "Sauce Boss", in which Klaypex was responsible for the track production.
Their album Anything Goes was released on August 12, 2014.
