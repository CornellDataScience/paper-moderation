== History ==

Some homesteaders and other settlers were established in the area before the arrival of the railroads, being situated along the remains of the historic Swift Current-Battleford Trail, but the majority of newcomers arrived by rail later. The town of Elrose was originally called LaBerge after local landowner Albert LaBerge. After the railway arrived in 1913, the countryside quickly filled with people and a meeting was called to discuss a permanent name for the town. Elrose was chosen, although the origin of this name is unclear for certain.
Elrose incorporated as a village in 1914. Schools and grain elevators were built, the town grew as more people arrived, and prairie sod was turned under to sow crops. The newly tilled land was rich, agriculture was profitable, and communities thrived. In 1951 Elrose reached Town status. During the 1960s and 1970s, smaller villages in the area (Hughton, Wartime, Forgan, Greenan) began to decline and their populations migrated to Elrose.
The Town of Elrose continues to move forward with the times and new prosperity appears as the local oilpatch is growing significantly. The agriculture industry is thriving as well, contributing to recent growth in the community.
