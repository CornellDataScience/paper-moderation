St Andrew's Presbyterian Church opened on Wed 3 March 1909. It was described as a "striking and substantial edifice".
The foundation stone for All Saints' Anglican Church was laid by Mrs H. Fisher of Headington Hill with an address by the Anglican Bishop of Brisbane William Webber on Thursday 14 March 1889. It was dedicated later in 1889. In 1905 it was re-built and re-dedicated.
