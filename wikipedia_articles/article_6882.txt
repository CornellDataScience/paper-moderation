SOIUSA (an acronym for Suddivisione Orografica Internazionale Unificata del Sistema Alpino - English: International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps-ISMSA) is a proposal for a new classification system of the Alps from the geographic and toponomastic point of view.
It was designed by Sergio Marazzi, Italian researcher and author of the Orographic Atlas of the Alps SOIUSA. His book was presented with the patronage of the Italian Alpine Club on 23 Jan 2006, but has yet to receive any formal acceptance.


== History ==
The SOIUSA is an interpretation by Marazzi of the terrain of the Alps aiming to replace the traditional way the Alps were partitioned in Italy, the Partizione delle Alpi, which was adopted in 1926 by the Italian National Geographic Committee (Comitato Geografico Nazionale) after the IX Italian Geographic Congress (Congresso Geografico Italiano). 
SOIUSA takes into account the European geographic literature normalizing and standardizing the different national classification systems in use. It was publicly presented in a lecture organized by the Italian Alpine Club's Milan conference of 6 April 2006, following the publication of Marazzi's book.


== Structure ==

The SOIUSA introduces the bipartition of the Alpine System (Western Alps and Eastern Alps) replacing the old tripartite division (Western Alps, Central Alps and Eastern Alps) by a multilevel pyramidal hierarchy according to identical scales and rules.
Mountain groups higher level:
fractionated with morphological and altimetric benchmark taking into account the historical and geographical regions in the Alps.

2 main parts (PT) (de:Teile;  fr:grandes parties; it:parti; sl:dela):
Western Alps and Eastern Alps.
5 major sectors (SR)   (de:Sektoren;  fr:grands secteurs; it:settori; sl:velikih sektorjev):
the occidental part is divided into two areas from south to north and then northeast: Southwestern Alps and Northwestern Alps;
the oriental part is divided into three areas from west to east: Central Eastern Alps, North Eastern Alps, South Eastern Alps.
36 sections  (SZ)  (de:Sektionen;  fr:sections; it:sezioni; sl:sekcij).
132 subsections (STS)  (de:Untersektionen;  fr:sous-sections; it:sottosezioni; sl:podsekcij).
Mountain groups lower level:
divided with a benchmark  mountaineering.

333 supergroups (SPG) (de:Supergruppen;  fr:super-groupes; it:supergruppi; sl:nadskupina).
870 groups (GR) (de:Gruppen;   fr:groupes; it:gruppi; sl:skupine).
1625 subgroups (STG) (de:Untergruppen;  fr:sous-groupes; it:sottogruppi; sl:podskupine).
(With some relative sectors (SR) intermediate to groups above)
To any alpine mountain can be assigned a SOIUSA code, which shows to what part, sector, section, subsection, supergroup, group and subgroup the mountain belongs.
Example: 


=== Naming ===
Names of higher level groups are given in the four main languages spoken in  the Alps (German, French, Italian, Slovene) and in English, while lower level groups are just named in the language/languages of the concerned country/countries.
Examples:
