=== Imperial Star Command Band ===
Western Boone's marching band was founded in the summer of 1974 under the direction of Richard J. Gress, the former music teacher and band director of Thorntown High School. Continuing the tradition set by the Thorntown High School marching band, The Imperial Star Command Band participated in the summer marching events hosted by the Central Indiana Track Show Association (CITSA) from 1974-1979.
In 1977 Steven A. Meurer was hired as the school's new band director. Under new direction, the band began participating in the Indiana State School Music Association's (ISSMA) Fall marching in 1977. The Imperial Star Command Band would have their highest placement of 8th at the State Finals in 1983 under the direction of Dana H. Heidenreich. They continued to participate in ISSMA events until 1988, when the program took a five year absence until their return in 1994.
In 2006, Brad Hisey took over the program and continued to participate in ISSMA events until 2009. In 2010, the program returned to the Summer marching events hosted by CITSA and has continued to participate, most recently in the 2023 Indiana State Fair Band Day event. In the 2023 season, under the direction of Leslie Baker, the Imperial Star Command Band placed 11th place in the preliminary scoring. That placement allowed the band to participate in the Indiana State Fair Band Day Finals for the first time since 1979. The band competed in the finals in the following years (with finals score placements):

1974 (16th place)
1975 (16th place)
