In 1999, Mem Nahadr created a music label to promoted her music and protect her interests. She named this company MADWOMAN MULTIMEDIA,  as an acquaintance once commented,  "You always work like a Madwoman!". She is the sole artist on this label.
In 2008, she presented her first off-Broadway theatrical production, Madwoman: A Contemporary Opera. co-produced by Grammy winner James P. Nichols, and Harvard LOEB Theater director, Claude E. Sloan, Jr.
Nahadr, being an albinistic African American, was requested in 2004 by National Geographic Magazine to have a portrait made of her by renowned photojournalist Robert Clark, to be included in an article on genetic inheritance, ideas of diversity and acceptance of difference. Later that year, the portrait and some of Nahadr's artistic work were included in the magazine's "Best of the Year" collection of images.
Another portrait of Nahadr travels internationally in the Positive Exposure exhibition (featuring many people with albinism and other genetic conditions) by notable fashion photographer and human rights activist Rick Guidotti. The collection was launched at the Smithsonian Institution during the Mapping of the Human Genome Celebration in 2000.
In 2009, Nahadr released her fifth studio album entitled EclecticIsM internationally, to critical acclaim. AMG/Billboard gave it 4 stars, while BBC Music presenter Kevin Le Gendre called it "The soul album of the year for its challenge to the genre itself".

This film was released by Lionsgate Entertainment, Hollywood, California.
Award-winning journalist Kevin Le Gendre included Nahadr extensively in his 2012 book Soul Unsung: Reflections on the Band in Black Popular Music.

In March 2013, Nahadr began the creation of a new opera entitled FEMME FRACTALE - An Opera of Reflection, for the theater. James P. Nichols and Claude E. Sloan, Jr supported this presentation with co-production and state-of-the-art technical and creative design.
In April 2015, the second opus of her operatic work FEMME FRACTALE was released in audio form and began to be performed in theaters internationally again to critical acclaim.  James Nadal from All About Jazz stated: "This record pushes the boundaries of where vocalization can go. This aptly named 'Opera of Reflection' is a determined and energetic project, depicting how positive energy can be channeled into music that is palatable yet vanguard, and realized with a cosmic message of confidence. Mem Nahadr is very much the modern woman who is savoring her role as a visionary artist, creating futuristic music for a contemporary audience that appreciates the effort it takes to accomplish something so imaginative."
