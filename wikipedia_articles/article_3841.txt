== Reception ==
Hugo Rifkind of The Times remarked of the series, "it's tremendous. I'm not sure there's been a drama like it in years".
In the Sunday Times, Camilla Long said The Gold was “astonishingly, lavishly, well realised”, while Esquire said that The Gold was “British TV at its best” and had “all the hallmarks of a crime classic”.
Radio Times said it was "an intricately crafted crime drama". Euan Franklin of Culture Whisper said The Gold "proves that shows dealing in largely British matters are just as ambitious as prestige American television".
The New Statesman called it "outstandingly enjoyable TV", with the Evening Standard calling it "a truly smart British crime drama with a classic feel and a knockout cast".
Ellen E. Jones of The Guardian dubbed it an "ever-enjoyable ride". Nick Hilton of The Independent remarked the show was "a lively, creative piece of work from writer-creator Neil Forsyth, which bubbles away with the vigour of a red-hot crucible".
There was some criticism of the perceived sympathetic portrayal of Kenneth Noye from the family of the man he murdered and one of the police officers involved in his conviction.


=== Accolades ===
The series was nominated for Best Drama Series at the Royal Television Society Programme Awards. In March 2024, the series was nominated in the Best Drama category at the 2024 British Academy Television Awards.
Neil Forsyth was nominated for Best Writer Film and TV at the 2023 Scottish BAFTAS. 


== Book ==
Screenwriter Neil Forsyth co-wrote a book with Thomas Turner entitled The Gold: The real story behind Brink's-Mat: Britain's biggest heist and published by Penguin Random House, which had involved extensive interviews with some of the major characters involved. Forsyth commented on the morality of the story, saying they were not seeking "a black-and-white reading of it. No-one in the show is an out-and-out criminal living in a world dictated by criminality. They've got families and lives". Forsyth gives historical context and says, "Social mobility is an interesting aspect, because it was obviously a theme of the time in the 1980s. I think we examine that...Criminality is a tool which they're trying to use to achieve something".
