== Background and release ==
Hasselhoff released three albums which became a huge success in Europe: Looking for Freedom (1989), Crazy for You (1990) and David (1991). Those albums were produced by German music producer Jack White. Everybody Sunshine became the last album to be produced by White, who collaborated with Hasselhoff since 1988, as he didn't write any song on the album. It also became Hasselhoff's last release under the White Records label, with his following albums being released by Ariola/BMG Records.
