The Nishan Sahib (Punjabi: ਨਿਸ਼ਾਨ ਸਾਹਿਬ, lit. 'respected ensign'), also known as the Sikh flag, is used to represent the Sikh people worldwide. In 1936, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ratified the Sikh Rehet Maryada, which states its colour as either basanti (xanthic) or surmai (navy blue). It is a triangular flag with a Khanda in its centre, made of cotton or silk cloth, and has a tassel at its end.
The most common form of the Nishan Sahib, used in gurdwaras around the world, features a saffron (orange) colour. The Akal Takht decided on 15 July 2024, in accordance with the Sikh Rehat Maryada, that only basanti or surmai colours are acceptable, while kesri (saffron) is not.


== Overview ==

The flag is hoisted on a tall flagpole outside most Gurdwaras. The flagpole itself, covered with fabric (called chola) of the same colour as the flag proper, ends with a Khanda on top (In the past an Astbuj, nagani barsha or a teer would be placed on top). The emblem on the flag is known as Khanda, which depicts a double-edged sword called a khanda (Miri te Piri) (☬) in the centre, a chakkar which is circular, and flanked by two single-edged swords, or kirpans. 
Almost all Sikh warriors used to wear it in the eighteenth century, and Nihangs of today still do. The Khanda Sahib is not to be confused with the Nihang's Aad Chand which was the first symbol of the Khalsa. The Khanda was not introduced by Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji but it was a plain yellow banner.
Traditional symbol of the Khalsa Panth (corps of initiated Sikhs), the Nishan Sahib can be seen from far away, signifying the presence of Khalsa in the neighbourhood. It is taken down every Baisakhi (harvest festival, mid-April in the Gregorian calendar and in Vaisakh month in the Nanakshahi calendar), and replaced with a fresh flag, and the flagpole refurbished.
The flagbearer or standardbearer carrying the Nishan Sahib in a procession is referred to as a Nishanchi.
The Nishan Sahib is placed outside Sikh Gurdwaras and is supported by a pole.
The Khanda, a Sikh symbol, today, is rendered in navy blue on the saffron background while the original was basanti (bright yellow) and surrmai neela (Royal blue). The khanda is placed high up on a flagpole as a sign for all Sikhs and indeed any other people that they can come and pray in this building. Great respect is shown to this flag and the flag is considered sacred and washed using milk and water every year in April at the festival of Vaisakhi. The Nishan Sahib is changed once the saffron color has faded.
The Sikh Rehat Maryada clearly states that the Nishan Sahib hoisted outside every Gurudwara should be xanthic (Basanti in Punjabi) or greyish blue (modern day Navy blue) (Surmaaee in Punjabi) color.


== History ==


=== Guru Amar Das ===
In the era of Guru Amar Das, a white-triangular flag was erected at the then-newly constructed Baoli Sahib (stepwell) located in Goindwal on the bank of the Beas River. This white flag was coined the dhaval dhuja ('white banner'). The white in the flag symbolized Piri, or saintliness, but also "goodwill" and "peace", and also acting as a landmark to aid visitors seeking out a Sikh site. Some Sikh scholars believe there was also an Ik Onkar symbol inscribed on the flag that represented the oneness of the divine. The white flag was a characterization of the raj (era) embarked by Guru Nanak. Pashaura Singh speculates that the colour of the Nishan Sahib located at the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar was white as well during the period of Bhai Gurdas.
Within the Guru Granth Sahib, there is a reference made to the flag established by Guru Amar Das in a hymn penned by Bhatt Kalshar:


=== Guru Ram Das ===
In a sawaiye composition authored by Bhatt Mathura in-praise of Guru Ram Das, it is stated:


=== Guru Arjan ===
Bhai Gurdas makes specific mention of a flag existing at the court of Guru Arjan in the 24th ballad of his Varan composition (24:18–23).
A mention of the banner during the period of Arjan was made by Bhatt Kalh in a sawaiye composition he authored:


=== Guru Hargobind ===
After the martyrdom of Guru Arjan, the colour of the formerly white Sikh flag was replaced with saffron to symbolize sacrifice.
A new envisionment of the Nishan Sahib was raised by Guru Hargobind at the consecration of the Akal Bunga in 1606. The flag during this time was known as the Akal Dhuja ("the immortal flag") or Satguru ka Nishan (standard of the true Guru). Guru Hargobind inscribed the flag with two symbols: the two swords of miri and piri, which were actual swords and a representation of the Sikh dual concept of temporality and spirituality.
When Hargobind was imprisoned at the Gwalior Fort by the Mughal authorities, a protest march was organized by Baba Buddha and Bhai Gurdas. The protest march was known as chaunki charhni and it began from the Akal Takht in Amritsar and ended at the Gwalior Fort. It consisted of a flagbearer (nishanchi) at the front of the procession holding the Nishan Sahib. Beside the flagbearer was a torchbearer, known as a mishalchi.


=== Guru Gobind Singh ===
Guru Gobind Singh imprinted two symbols on the Nishan Sahib after the formalization of the Khalsa order in 1699: a cooking vessel or cauldron to represent deg (food for all) and a sword, known as a tegh (justice for all). These concepts were Sikh ideals to live up to and were represented by these symbols on the flag.


=== Sikh Confederacy ===
During the time of the Sikh Misls, the misl which was responsible for bearing the Nishan Sahib was the Nishanwalia Misl, named after this role. The Nishanwalia Misl also was responsible for appointing the flag-bearers for the other misls. The role assigned to carry the flag in procession was considered an honourable one.


=== Sikh Empire ===
Within the Sikh Khalsa Army, different regiments had their own particular flags they flew.


=== Colonial period ===
Later during the British Rule it became from Basanti and Surmayee to Kesari. 
The modern form and envisionment of the Nishan Sahib can be traced back ultimately to the time of the Singh Sabha movement.


=== Present day ===
Most modern Nishan Sahibs are saffron in colour but the Nihang sect of Sikhs usually maintain a dark blue-coloured flag at their gurdwaras. In a 26 July 2024 circular, the SGPC mandated that the Nishan Sahib flown by Sikhs should be either basanti (xanthic) or surmai (greyish-blue) in colour.


== Weapons and ornaments ==
The original Nishan Sahib carried by Guru Gobind Singh ji in the Kattar, Dhal, Kirpan format had either a Ashtabhuja Duja, Nangini Barcha or Karpa Barcha used as a spear on top. The Nagni Barcha or snake like sword was created by Guru Gobind Singh ji and famously used by Bhai Bachittar Singh to pierce the trunk of a drunken, armored elephant in the Battle of Nimolgarh. The Ashtabhuja is a spear with three crescents stuck to an iron rod with two spears coming out on top. The Ashtabhuja was mainly used as the Battle Stadered of the Tenth Guru and is highly recommended. Guru Gobind Singh Ji's ashtabhuja was found in Chamkaur sahib the place where his two sons were martyred and other two captured with his mother. The flag is simply wrapped around the top of the spear with two strings of fabric coming out of the tip.
While today's Nishan Sahib has a Khanda in a dagger form on top of the flag and the fabric covering the spear till the top. The Khanda symbol is also relatively new and was made in the early 19th century.
