== History ==
In 2009, Pedro Espinosa left his job at British Petroleum to continue his family's business tradition in the world of gastronomy and opened the first llaollao outlet. A year later, he expanded the business based on the franchising model. Currently, the company that incorporates healthy values (a medium-sized tub contains 46% of the Calcium Recommended Daily Allowance) and a fresh image, is a leader among its competitors. By July 2015, Llaollao had generated a total of 1,000 jobs during the five years that have passed since it launched its franchise model to the market. In 2016, llaollao commenced a 70-outlet expansion in Japan.
On 7 December 2017, D+1 terminated its master franchisee with llaollao Singapore and rebranded its 29 stores to another frozen yogurt brand named Yole. llaollao Singapore later released a statement on Facebook stating that "we are far from finished in Singapore" and announced its intent to return to the Singapore market.
On 16 June 2018, llaollao Singapore returned under a new master franchise under Manna. With strong demand, more outlets have been opened by the end of 2018.
On 16 November 2018, llaollao opened its first US outlet at the Houston Galleria. This location is a Petit location so it does not offer the full-range menu as the llaollao stores in Spain, however, it still offers the tubs, sanums and in October 2019, introduced the fondue and the smoothies.

In July 2015, Llaollao enlarged its menu and included products allowed for gluten intolerants such as green apple and passion fruit sauces as well as chocolate and candied almonds crunches. llaollao also utilises biodegradable cups and napkins made out of recycled materials in their effort to contribute to improving the environment.
