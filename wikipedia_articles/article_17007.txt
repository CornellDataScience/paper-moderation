CCGS Mamilossa is a Canadian Coast Guard Hoverwork AP1-88/400 air cushioned vehicle or hovercraft based at CCG Hovercraft Base Trois-Rivières, Quebec. The first of three hovercrafts of the AP1-88/400 design ordered by the Canadian Coast Guard, Mamilossa was the only one constructed in the United Kingdom by Hoverworks Ltd. with the remaining units, CCGS Sipu Muin and CCGS Siyay, built under license by Hike Metal Products of Wheatley, Ontario, Canada. Mamilossa is the largest hovercraft exported by British shipbuilders and was launched in 2008. The hovercraft's name is Abenaki for "it walks from the shore onto the water fair winds". The hovercraft entered service in 2009. 
The primary missions of Mamilossa are icebreaking and search and rescue along coastlines in the Quebec Region. The vessel can perform secondary tasks, such as navigational aid work and use as a buoy tender.

Mamilossa was built by Hoverworks Ltd. at their yard in Cowes, England. The vessel was launched in 2008 and underwent trials off the Isle of Wight. Mamilossa, which means  "it walks from the shore onto the water fair winds" in the Abenaki language, entered service in 2009 with the Canadian Coast Guard and provides icebreaking, search and rescue, and navigational aid maintenance. The vessel is based at CCG Hovercraft Base Trois-Rivières, Quebec. As part of the Canadian Coast Guard's fleet renewal plan, the acquisition of four new ACVs was announced to replace Mamilossa and the other hovercraft.
