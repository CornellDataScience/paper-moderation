Slater played college football for the UCLA Bruins, where he earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors, and was selected by the Patriots in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL draft. He holds the record for special teams Pro Bowl selections at 10, which he set between 2011 and 2021. Slater also received five first-team All-Pros and won three Super Bowl titles.

== College career ==
Slater attended the University of California, Los Angeles and majored in political science and history, while playing for the Bruins football team. As a freshman, he redshirted due to a turf toe injury.
As a freshman redshirt in 2004, Slater appeared in games against Illinois, Arizona, and Stanford.
As a sophomore in 2005, Slater was a reserve wide receiver. He missed the first three games due to a stress fracture in his left leg. Slater played in two games but did not make a reception.
As a junior in 2006, Slater played 13 games, including two (against Washington and Arizona) on defense. He excelled on kick coverage, specializing in big hits on kick returners to help minimize kick return yardage. In the year, he made nine tackles, including six solo tackles.
As a senior in 2007, Slater played in 13 games and made 25 tackles. He also returned 34 kicks for a 29-yard average and 3 touchdowns which tied the lead in the nation and set the UCLA record.

=== 2008 ===
Slater was selected in the fifth round, 153rd overall, of the 2008 NFL draft by the New England Patriots, who traded up with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before drafting Slater. Matthew's father, Jackie Slater, was pleased with the selection and told the Boston Herald that he received phone calls from "scouts, administrators in the NFL who knew me and my son, and they said, ‘Jackie, this could not be a better fit for your son to start being a pro football player.'" Slater was one of two players selected in the 2008 Draft (the other being Chris Long), and the sixth in the history of the NFL Draft, who is a son of a Hall of Fame member.
