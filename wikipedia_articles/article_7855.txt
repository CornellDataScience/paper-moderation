St. Ann's Academy remained  a high school until 1970, unable to keep up with the changing demands of B.C.'s curriculum, it reverted to an elementary school. The Sisters continued to administer the school until 1978. Although the Sisters of St. Ann's, from the city of Victoria's St. Ann's Academy founded the school, they no longer teach there.
