Maysville is a town in Garvin and McClain counties, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,232 at the 2010 census, down from 1,313 in 2000.


== History ==
A post office was established at this location on March 19, 1878, and operated until May 29, 1878.  It was reestablished as Beef Creek, Indian Territory on June 17, 1878.  The post office took its name from nearby Beef Creek, a tributary of the Washita River.
On September 19, 1902, after the town had relocated a mile north to be alongside the tracks of the newly-laid Kiowa, Chickasha and Fort Smith Railway (an affiliate of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway), and the post office joined it, the name was changed to Maysville.  The new name was in honor of David Mayes and John Mayes, local ranchers.
At the time of its founding, Beef Creek, later Maysville, was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.
