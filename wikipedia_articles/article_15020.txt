GTFO is a 2021 cooperative first-person shooter game developed and published by 10 Chambers. GTFO released in early access for Windows on December 9, 2019. The game was officially released two years later, on December 10, 2021, during The Game Awards 2021. In the game, the players control prisoners sent into a facility overrun by monsters and use guns, tools, and melee weapons to dispatch the monsters and complete objectives.


== Gameplay ==
There are eight "rundowns", each of which consists of multiple expeditions. In each expedition, the players control up to four prisoners who are placed in a run-down underground facility called "The Complex", and must complete the objectives the "Warden", an entity with unknown motivations, has asked them to.

The Complex is overrun with humanoid monsters referred to as "sleepers", because they start off asleep. While asleep, the sleepers occasionally glow, causing them to detect player movement. They will also wake up if the players fire their guns near the sleepers, otherwise make noise, shine their flashlights on them, or hit them without killing them. They can be silently killed with a physical attack using a spear, sledgehammer, knife, or bat. If a sleeper detects a player, other nearby sleepers will wake up and attack the players. 
The Complex consists of zones: groups of rooms separated by security doors. To open a security door, the players must be scanned by the door. The scan consists of an orange circle that appears below the door that all the players must stand in for some time, followed by the circle splitting into multiple smaller ones that must be stood in by individual players. Some doors have alarms which blare during a scan, causing sleepers to attack the players for the duration of the scan. The players have tools to prepare for these attacks, such as a "C-foam launcher" that increases the time it takes the sleepers to break doors, gun turrets, and landmines.
In order to locate objectives and resources such as gun ammunition, the players often must use a terminal to help find the desired object.
