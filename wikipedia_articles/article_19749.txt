== History ==

Richland School District was established in 1917 after a wooden schoolhouse was built in Geistown. The school was small. A permanent brick building was built in 1923 along the same road as the original wooden structure. 
The 1923 brick building continued to function as a senior high school until 1954 when a new high school was completed on Scalp Avenue. Through the 1960s, the district went through rapid expansion. Two elementary school and a middle schools were all built within a decade of each other near Theatre Drive. The district continued its expansion when in 1970, it completed an even newer high school for students. During this time, the 1923 building and 1954 building were being used for lower grades.
In 2003, the roof collapsed in the Richland Middle School. This caused severe structural damage to the school. It was decided that a new, junior-senior high school would be built, which would encompass grades 7 to 12. In the meantime, middle school-aged students were instead taught in the Rachel Hill building near the elementary school. The new school began construction in 2006 but was not finished until 2007. In that same year, Penn Highlands Community College finished a renovation project on the 1970 senior high and began to use it as their own campus the following year.
The old elementary school, Rachel Hill, which was opened in 1960, was demolished in 2020. It had been vacant since 2007, when it was briefly used as a middle school, but before that it had been closed since 1998.
During the Coronavirus Pandemic in 2020, Richland School District shut down in mid-March, and stayed closed for the remainder of the 2019–2020 school year. During the following school year, Richland briefly went to remote learning, then later to a hybrid remote-physical model as COVID-19 cases spiked during the 2020 holiday season. For the 2021–2022 school year, Richland followed strict mask mandates from the state government until February 2022, when the board voted to make face coverings optional.
