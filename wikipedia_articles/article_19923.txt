María Dávila Guerra (born 1990) is a contemporary Spanish painter. She was born in Málaga, and lives and works in Granada.


== Biography ==
María Dávila holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Málaga and a PhD in History and Arts from the University of Granada.
While still a student, she started to have solo exhibitions and to participate in group shows in major art centers in Andalusia. In 2014, she won the MálagaCrea 2014 First prize and was preselected two years consecutively to the BMW paintings Awards in 2015 and 2016.


== Work ==
Her painting deals with the limits of the visible and the boundaries between fiction and reality. Based on a photographic or cinematographic material (family archives, still from movies or documentary films), María Dávila explores, more specifically, some aspects of her main theme in different series:

"Anagnórisis – La trama" (2014) seeks to highlight the underlying similitudes between fiction and documentary films, with an emphasis on the interpretive nature of our relationship to reality.
"Solsticio" (2015) deals with our inability to recognize our image and the non-correspondence between memory and lived experience. The series is based on an album of family photographs.
"Dramatis personae" (2015) is about the act of looking and being looked at through a dialogue with cinematographic form based on narrative (de)construction such as Surrealist or Nouvelle Vague films.
"Post scriptum" is focused on the narrative construction in personal relationships, through a dialogue with cinema and theater.
