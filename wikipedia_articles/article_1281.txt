The Australian cricket team toured Sri Lanka from 6 August to 20 September 2011. The tour consisted of two Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is), five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Tests played for Warne–Muralitharan Trophy. Four uncapped players had been named in the Australian Test squad; Shaun Marsh, Trent Copeland, James Pattinson and Nathan Lyon. Lyon had only made four first-class appearances and was previously one of the groundstaff at the Adelaide Oval.
During the test series, a five-year old kid going by the name Sharujan Shanmuganathan caught the attention of viewers when his free-flowing, elegant cover drive became a talking point as it was captured by one of the cameramen during the course of the test match. Sharujan was only five-years-old when he received recognition for playing cover drives, and commentator Tony Greig, who was named as one of the commentators for the test match, reportedly spotted him playing at the grass bank of the Singhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground. Tony Greig eventually nicknamed him "Little Sanga" during the air while doing commentary, and Greig later went on to interview the five-year-old Sharujan, which became an instant hit on television.
