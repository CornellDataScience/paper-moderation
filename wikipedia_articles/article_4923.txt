Flaka e Janarit ("January Flame") is a multidimensional cultural event that starts on 11 January in Gjilan, Kosovo with symbolic opening of the flame, to keep up with various cultural activities to 31 January of each year.
In this city, it gathers thousands of artists and art lovers from all the Albanian territories, who for three consecutive weeks transform the city into a culture metropolis. The nation's martyrs are honored through values of art by this event, which began before the 10th anniversary of the assassination of the writer, the activist and the patriot Jusuf Gërvalla, along with Kadri Zeka and Bardhosh Gërvalla.
It was exactly the tenth anniversary without these three martyrs of freedom and from coincidence of these murders in a same date on 11 January, this event got this name Flaka e Janarit. Moreover, this month has "devoured" many devout patriots.


== History ==
This event started in 1991. For years it is being developed in these places, Bresalca–Përlepnica–Gjilan. "Flaka e Janarit" did not only serve as a highly qualitative cultural event to remember martyrs, it also reflected the situation in Kosovo. Founder of Manifestation were Independent Cultural Association (which operated from 1991 to 1999) and the Youth Forum of LDK, in Gjilan. Also the one who contributed a lot, one of the biggest supporters until his death, was known as Albanian writer, Beqir Musliu.
It was named as "Flaka e Janarit", because in this month heroically had fallen martyrs, as Skanderbeg, Jusuf Gërvalla, Isa Boletini, Kadri Zeka, Bardhosh Gërvalla, Rexhep Mala, Nuhi Berisha and other Albanians who gave their life for freedom and national unity.
Until 1999, this event was held in circumstances of occupation by Serbian militants. For this reason it was considered an illegal organization for eight consecutive years.
In 1999 when the massacre of Reçak happened, shocked the democratic world, and as a sign of mourning and honor to the massacred martyrs, organizers removed over half of the program. This let us understand that, even after many hard circumstances of Kosova from invaders, "Flaka e Janarit" did not stop its journey.
There were four pillars, derived from writing of Jusuf Gërvalla: Literary, performing, music, and visual arts
