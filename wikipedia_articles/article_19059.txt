The College of Science, Mathematics, and Technology (abbreviated as CSMT) was the science college of the former (1992-2015) University of Texas at Brownsville.  It consisted of six academic departments. The six departments employed diverse faculty members - many of whom are leading experts in the fields - who have received funding from a variety of funding agencies, including the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Education, and the Department of Defense, among others. The average active ongoing external funding is about 25-30 million dollars. In 2002, the Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy (CGWA) research center was founded to help "develop excellence in research and education in areas related to gravitational wave astronomy."
CSMT had partnership agreements for scientific collaboration and students exchange with universities in Europe, Asia and Australia.As of 2012, the college hosted more than 1,000 students enrolled in twenty-eight undergraduate and seven graduate programs. The programs offer a range of degree plans from certificates and associate degrees up to cooperative Ph.D. degrees with University of Texas at San Antonio. The college hosts annual national/international conferences and workshops in discrete geometry and gravitational waves among others.  In 2012, CSMT initiated its own cohort program and student advisory council.


== Departments ==


=== Department of Biological Sciences ===
The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Texas at Brownsville undertakes teaching, research, and community service.  The department offers courses that cover a range of biological topics at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Current research interests cover a broad range of taxonomic groups (e.g. all things aquatic) to a variety of ecosystems (e.g., coastal marine, subtropical, thorn scrub, and freshwater).

=== Department of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences ===
The Department of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences at the University of Texas at Brownsville undertakes teaching and research. Current research projects include wetland restoration at the Bahia Grande Unit of Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, artificial reef monitoring in the Gulf of Mexico, and the impacts of the US-Mexico border fence. Students work with organic molecules, assembling them at the thicknesses of a single molecule as well as nanotechnology. The department has also looked into the recent swine flu epidemic, and work on furthered understanding of how indigenous medicinal plants used in the US-Mexico Border region may be used in the treatment of diabetes.

== CSMT Cohort Program ==
Starting in fall 2012, first-time freshman majoring in Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, or Engineering were eligible to join the CSMT Cohort Program.  A cohort is a group of students who follow the same set schedule and progress through an accelerated program together.  The program was created in order to create an interactive learning environment, facilitate networking opportunities, strengthen student relationships, and enhance the learning experience.
