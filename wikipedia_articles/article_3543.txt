The 2023–24 Bangladesh Premier League, also known as the  ABG Bashundhara Bangladesh Premier League for sponsorship reasons, was the 16th season of the Bangladesh Premier League since its establishment in 2007. A total of 10 football clubs were competed in the league. The country's top-flight football competition was started on 22 December 2023 and ended on 29 May 2024.
Bashundhara Kings are the defending champions, having won a record 5th consecutive title with previous season.


== Rule changes from last season ==
The number of player registrations of participating teams is increased by 1 player from 35 players to 36 players.
A club can sign maximum of six foreigners including at least one player who hails from an AFC affiliated nation. However, the AFC "3+1" foreign players rule (three players of any nationality and one from an AFC MA) will be in effect at any instant of a match.


== Teams ==
Ten teams will compete in the league – the top nine teams from the previous season and the two teams promoted from the Bangladesh Championship League. The promoted teams are Brothers Union and Gopalganj Sporting Club. Brothers will return to the top flight after an absence of two years, while Gopalganj will make their debut in the Premier League. They are replacing Muktijoddha Sangsad KC and AFC Uttara, who were relegated to the Bangladesh Championship League after respective spells of sixteen years and one year in the top flight. Muktijoddha suffered relegation for the first time since the inception of the Premier League in 2007. On the final day of the players' registration window, Gopalganj Sporting Club confirmed their withdrawal from the BPL due to the financial shortage. In May 2024, the BFF announced that there will be only one relegation this season as the league was kicked off with reduced participants after Gopalganj's withdrawal. On July 17, 2024, the BFF announced that there would be no relegations made from the league, allowing the previously relegated Brothers Union to retain their place in the league for the following season.
