The Ross Volunteer Company (commonly known as the Ross Volunteers or the RVs) is the military escort of the governor of Texas and a unit of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets.


== History ==


=== Establishment and early history ===
The Ross Volunteers were established as a military drill team at the A&M College of Texas in 1887 under the name Scott Volunteers, honoring Col. Thomas M. Scott, the college's business manager. In 1891 the name of the unit was changed to the Ross Volunteers in honor of the college president at the time, Lawrence Sullivan Ross, and later changed to the Foster Guards under the presidency of L. L. Foster, and then the Houston Rifles under the presidency of David F. Houston. In 1905 the name was permanently set as the Ross Volunteers, when Henry Harrington, the son-in-law of Ross, was president.


=== Later history ===
The unit was dormant during World War II but was reactivated in 1948. Among its first public engagements following its reconstitution was to escort Governor of Texas Beauford Jester and General Jonathan Wainwright to that year's Texas A&M vs University of Texas football game; the bearing and discipline of the unit was remarked upon by Wainwright. In 1950 the unit was named military escort to the governor of Texas, a role it continues to perform. In 1985, the Ross Volunteers were opened to female participation following a federal court order.
During the state funeral of George H. W. Bush, the Ross Volunteers formed the guard of honor during the removal of the casket from Bush's funeral train upon its arrival in College Station, Texas.
The Ross Volunteers are the oldest cadet organization in existence at Texas A&M University, though the now defunct Stephen F. Austin Literary Society and the Calliopean Society were founded earlier.
