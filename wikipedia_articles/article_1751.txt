The inaugural tournament, held in 2013, was won by Phil Taylor, who defeated Adrian Lewis 10–1 in the final. James Wade won the following year by defeating Mervyn King 11–10 in the 2014 final. Michael van Gerwen became the third different champion in 3 years when he defeated Raymond van Barneveld 11–6. 
In 2013 and 2014, the tournament took place in the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh, Scotland and was played in early November. However, the tournament was moved to early February in 2015 and had a new venue at the Arena MK (renamed Marshall Arena in 2019) in Milton Keynes, England. The tournament has been held in late January/early February ever since.
