== Characters ==


=== Main ===
Gofrette. A curious anthropomorphic cat who makes every day in Zanimo (Europe) an exciting day with his huge imagination, endless supply of hobby equipment, and a go-for-it demeanour. He lives in a house with Red, the talking refrigerator to whom he talks and understands; with his stuffed animal, Long Ears; and with tiny, creatively active animals he calls "Gnugnuts". His uncle, Garbanzo, is an acrobat who owns and stars in the El Teatro Zanimo circus. Gofrette also has a grandmother, Granny Smith (named after a fruit), who is only mentioned and shown in photographs. He is voiced by Eleanor Noble. Gofrette's favourite exclamation is "Zowie!", sometimes with a variation such as, "Zowie zow zow!".
Fudge. An anthropomorphic dog with big floppy ears. Fudge is sometimes reluctant to get into what he thinks of as scary or embarrassing situations, but he is usually a good sport once participating. He is a bit fussy with his ears, and a source of his reluctance to participate in things. He owns a van called the Zanimo Wagon that he also lives in. He has been friends with Gofrette since they were a puppy and a kitty. He often uses the catchphrase, "Wowie Zowie Gofrette." He has a big brother named Moocher, who is a mechanic and artist. He is voiced by Sonja Ball. He is also known as "Blue" in books.
Ellie Coptor. A pink-coloured bird with a propeller on her head that twirls depending on her mood. She operates a hair salon in her treehouse and plays with a quite bit in fashion and makeovers. As best friends with Gofrette and Fudge, Ellie rounds out the three with her fun, creative, and sometimes nervous–but–always–strong personality. Ellie's favourite snack is worms (which grosses out Fudge). She is voiced by Lucinda Davis. She has an aunt named Edna who wrote a book (in the cartoon) called "Trapeze is For the Birds".
