Burt Brent is a retired reconstructive plastic surgeon best known for his work in reconstructing the absent outer ear. He built upon the techniques of his mentor, Dr. Radford Tanzer of the Mary Hitchcock Clinic at Dartmouth Medical School and repaired ear defects in 1,800 patients, most of them children born with ear deformities such as microtia. He also reconstructed ears lost or due to some form of trauma.


== Biography ==


=== Youth ===
Brent grew up in Detroit, Michigan, and was highly influenced by his maternal grandfather who taught him cabinetry and woodworking. Although he considered a career in art, he was always surrounded by medicine, because his father was a physician who had an office in the basement of their home. Eventually his father influenced him to pursue a career in medicine, and Brent decided to study plastic surgery so that he could employ his artistic background within that field. He received his B.S. degree at Wayne State University in Detroit and his M.D. degree at Chicago Medical School.
Following his internship at the University of Michigan, Brent entered the U.S. Army as a general medical officer and served one year with the 101st Airborne Division. The following year, he transferred to Panama where he served two more years as a medical officer with the Special Forces ("Green Berets"). It was at this time that he became fluent in Spanish, which served him well in helping many Latino patients.


=== Artist ===
As an avid naturalist, Brent is a member of the Society of Animal Artists and has created sculptures of numerous of birds and mammals. Some of these are large bronze sculptures which he has donated for his young patients and other children to enjoy in the San Diego Zoo and San Francisco Zoo.


=== Publications ===
Brent published more than 60 scientific articles and textbook chapters in the medical literature. He has coauthored, edited, and/or collaborated on several books:

Earl Scruggs and the Five-String Banjo, Peer International Music Corporation, New York, 1968; 2nd Edition, Hal Leonard Music Corporation, Milwaukee, 2005.
Brent, B. (Ed.): The Artistry of Reconstructive Surgery, C. V. Mosby Company, St. Louis, 1987.


== Medical practice ==
Brent specialized in ear reconstruction and had a private practice in Woodside, California. He was also on the teaching faculty at Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, California.  Brent, who learned sculpture before studying medicine, built upon and refined techniques developed by Dr. Radford Tanzer, who was a surgical professor at Dartmouth Medical College  He performed ear reconstruction surgery for more than 1,800 patients, most of them children born with ear deformities such as microtia.  He also reconstructed ears lost due to some form of trauma. Due to his commitment and tenure in this practice he saw children of previous patients, who have a higher risk of having children with similar deformities. He was named Clinician of the Year in 2005 by the American Association of Plastic Surgeons  Several of Brent's earliest and notable patients were famous kidnap victims who had their ears amputated and sent along with ransom notes.  Reconstruction of their ears resulted in a Time magazine article entitled "Surgery as Sculpture" and was instrumental in launching public awareness of Brent's work to parents of children with congenital birth deformities of the ear.
