=== Standards development ===
As information technology continues to advance, it is crucial to establish standards that can enhance the accessibility of the Bengali language in the field of information technology, ensuring its ease of use for everyone. The responsibility of promulgating these standards lies with the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI), while the task of technical drafting and declaration is carried out by the BCC. The organization has already developed several standards and simultaneously modernized the existing ones. Bangladesh Standards are:

Bangladesh Standard Specification for Bangla Coded Character Set for Information Interchange (Third Revision) (BDS 1520:2018): It defines the character encoding scheme for the Bangla script, facilitating information exchange and compatibility across various computer systems and applications in Bangladesh. This specification ensures seamless communication and data sharing, promotes the development of localized software and content in the Bengali language, and ultimately enhances accessibility and inclusivity for the Bengali-speaking population in the digital realm.
Bangladesh Standard Specification for Computer Bangla Keyboard (First Revision) (BDS 1738:2018): This standard outlines the standardized requirements for keyboards specifically designed to input the Bengali script into computer systems. Introduced in 2018, this standard ensures uniformity and compatibility among computer Bengali keyboards, facilitating efficient and accurate typing of Bengali characters. BDS 1738 defines the layout, key arrangement, and functional characteristics of the keyboard, ensuring it meets the needs and preferences of Bangla language users in Bangladesh.
Bangladesh Standard Codes for Information Interchange (BDS 1934:2018): To ensure compatibility and consistency in data exchange across various computer systems and applications within the country, there is a need for a national standard for ASCII-based Bengali character and symbol coding. The Bangladesh Computer Council has addressed this need by drafting the Bangladesh Standard Code for Information Interchange (BSCII). This code was created by reviewing popular Bengali language software based on ASCII in Bangladesh, and it includes a total of 210 Bengali letters, symbols, and compound letters. Its purpose is to define the character encoding system used for the interchange of information.
Due to lack of coherence and synergy between vendors and technologists, these standards were largely never widely accepted nor recognized by international bodies. Later, versions of standards such as BSCII in essence rubber stamped Unicode encoding scheme.
An official order to mandatorily install a keyboard layout package kit in 2018 spawned furor over multiple fronts.
