Foncia 2 is a IMOCA 60 Class offshore racing monohull sailing yacht launched in 2010.


== Construction and modifications ==
The boat was designed by Guillaume Verdier, VPLP design (Marc Van Peteghem and Vincent Lauriot-Prévost) with significant input also from Michel Desjoyeaux. It is an innovative hull, marked by a double chain and a bridge in "seagull wing", as well as bearing drifts. This sailboat is a second generation VPLP design. The boat was launched on a tight schedule, on 20 September 2010, just six months after the start of the project, at a cost of 3 million euros.
The tight timescale was made possible by the collaboration build effort consisting of the Green Marine shipyards in Lymington GBR and JMV Industries in Cherbourg (FRA). Green Marine made the plug and the moulded the hull and JMV the made the deck. The boat was assembled at the CDK Technologies site in Port-la-Forêt led by Hubert Desjoyeaux who is the brother Michel Desjoyeaux.
After several months of study, the boat went back to CDK Technologies over the winter of 2015–2016 were the daggerboards were replaced by hydrofoils.

=== 2020–2021 Vendée Globe ===
On December 2, 2020, at 7 p.m. (universal time), in the roaring 40s, more than 300 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, Samantha Davies sailed was sailing between 15 and 22 knots, in a wind of 30 knots in 11th place in the race. Suddenly, the boat hits an unidentified floating object and stopped in a brutal manner. She hears cracks and was thrown around the inside of the boat along with the meal she was preparing. As a result, she suffered bruising.
The cracks in the longitudinal in the keel structure surrounding the keel ram and potential damage to the fin and ram itself made it unsafe to enter the Southern Ocean with repair and inspection. So Samantha Davies diverted to Cape Town while options were considered she arrived on 5 December where she retired from the race. She then made the decision to carry on with her round the world voyage.
