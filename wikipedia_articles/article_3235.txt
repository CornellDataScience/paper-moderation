The American Society of Mexico (AmSoc) is a community organization and non-profit for the greater American Community living in Mexico. The organization was established on August 26, 1942, by then-United States Ambassador George S. Messersmith and American community leaders as the American population in Mexico started to increase with the purpose to represent the American community as a whole. Messersmith became the first honorary president and all United States ambassadors have become honorary presidents of the society ever since. Over the years, the society has organized events centered around American and Mexican traditions and formed partnerships to benefit the American Community in Mexico.


== History ==
The American Society of Mexico was one of the first players in uniting the American Community within Mexico, helping Americans integrate within Mexico and sharing many distinctly American traditions between the American Community in Mexico and Mexicans.
The founding president was Mr. Russell Ford Moody who was born on June 13, 1902, in Michigan and received his Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering by the University of Michigan in 1925. He was the vice president of the Canada Dry Bottling Company of Mexico, had been assistant general manager of the Compañía Hulera Euzkadi, and was alternate director of the Banco Internacional, Bank of London. He was also a board director to the American British Cowdray (ABC) Hospital, YMCA, and a standing member of the University Club, the American Club, Club de Banqueros, Masons and Tau Beta Pi. Married to Louise, he had two children: Jean Carol and Beverly.
The honorary president, George Strausser Messersmith, was born on October 3, 1883, in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. He entered the Foreign Service and served in different countries, including Germany during World War II, where he was best known for his controversial decision to issue a visa to Albert Einstein. In Mexico Ambassador Messersmith was not only responsible for the foundation of The American Society of Mexico, but also for establishing in the same year of 1942, the well-renowned Benjamin Franklin Library in Mexico City. He was appointed the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico up until 1947 by President Harry S. Truman.

== President ==

Larry Rubin is the President and chairman of the Board of The American Society of Mexico, an organization that has represented the American community and American interests in Mexico for the past 80 years. Together with the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, the Honorary President of AmSoc, he represents the two million Americans living in Mexico and all the American companies and NGOs that are here.
In many ways, Larry's background was tailor-made to head The American Society of Mexico. Growing up in his home in Mexico with his Mexican mother and American father, attending the American School in Mexico City, the Universidad Anahuac for his Bachelor's (where he is currently on the faculty), at Rice University in Texas for his M.B.A., Larry navigated between the American and Mexican cultures all his life. His extensive experience in business and in dealing with government officials make him a natural to understand the cultural, political, and commercial bilateral relations between the two countries. His deep commitment to promote and improve the ties that bind him also bind us, the members of this Society. Under Larry's leadership, AmSoc has been growing and moving in significant directions, making these last years banner ones. With what is already in the works, we can expect an even more dynamic and burgeoning organization. The recently created corporate councils, the exponential growth in AmSoc's involvement in the not for profit sector, expansion into the rest of the Latin American region all bode well for exciting next phase for The American Society of Mexico.[3]
