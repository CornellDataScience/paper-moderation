=== 2011–2012: Live and Unsigned and The X Factor ===
In July 2011, Spraggan was announced as the runner up of the Urban, Pop & Acoustic Category of Live and Unsigned, placing third place overall in the competition. Spraggan's prizes awarded by Live and Unsigned for her progress in the competition consisted of a festival slot at Osfest, and a slot at Australia's 'Go Connect' Festival. When the festival was later cancelled, Live and Unsigned provided Spraggan with a series of replacement prizes, including: a string of guest act spots at Live and Unsigned and Open Mic UK shows across the country, a new website, and a music video shoot for her single "Last Night", which has received over 4.2million views as of 2023.
On 20 October 2011 Spraggan independently released her album Top Room at the Zoo. In an interview she said that the majority of her album's lyrics were inspired by a short-lived romance with an older woman of 27 that occurred when Spraggan visited America at the age of 18.
Spraggan performed as a guest act at a large volume of Live and Unsigned and Open Mic UK shows across the country during this time, on Open Mic UK, Spraggan said in an interview: "Open Mic UK is a great way to build your fan base to thousands of new fans whether you are a guest act or a competitor in the show." As a result of performing at these shows, Spraggan was scouted by several festival organisers to perform at their festivals, amongst which included London Summer Jam, Osfest, Strawberry Fields Festival Whaley Bridge Water Weekend and Cockermouth Rock Festival.
On 13 July 2012, she released the single "Tea and Toast". Spraggan auditioned for the ninth series of The X Factor, which was shown on 25 August 2012, singing her own song "Last Night" from Top Room at the Zoo (2011). She won herself a place at bootcamp after performing the song, which left the audience at the Manchester auditions chanting for more. Her second song, which was a rendition of "Halo" by Beyoncé, was shown on The Xtra Factor. Shortly after the audition was screened, the song climbed to Number 70 in the UK Singles Chart, and reached Number 2 on iTunes. However, it was soon removed from iTunes by request of The X Factor producers. On 29 August 2012, Greg James announced that "Last Night" was at number 5 on the Official Chart Update despite the song being removed from iTunes, her album Top Room at the Zoo was at number 7 on the Official Chart Update as well. On 2 September 2012 "Last Night" entered the UK Singles Chart at number 11 and Top Room at the Zoo entered the UK Albums Chart at number 22.
Spraggan sang "Moves like Jagger" by Maroon 5 at bootcamp but the performance was described as "awkward" and "messy". She returned to the stage with a mix-up of songs that she really liked and meant a lot to her. Tulisa then said that she wanted to hear one of her tracks so Spraggan decided to sing "Tea and Toast", stating that the song was about a real couple. After she performed the song she burst into tears when she received a standing ovation from the audience and the judging panel.
She made it through to the live shows as one of the three female singers selected by mentor Tulisa. In week 4, Spraggan was ill so she automatically got through to week 5. On 3 November, she decided to leave the competition because she felt that it wouldn't be fair to get another free pass to the next round, as she was still too ill to compete. Spraggan later revealed that the real reason why she left the show was that she was raped during the production of the show.
