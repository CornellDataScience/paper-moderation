During the 1983–84 season Associazione Sportiva Roma competed in Serie A, Coppa Italia and European Cup.


== Summary ==
During the summer the club transferred in Brazilian midfielder Toninho Cerezo from Atletico Mineiro and forward Francesco Graziani from Fiorentina. Head coach Nils Liedholm changed the defensive style after the crucial centre–back Pietro Vierchowod's loan to Sampdoria ended. Another key player in midfielder Carlo Ancelotti was injured in early December during match against Juventus, thus missing the rest of the season. The squad finished second in the league behind champion Juventus.
Meanwhile, in the first round of the European Cup, the team defeated IFK Goteborg with an aggregate score of 4–2, after which the squad eliminated CSKA Sofia in the round of 16 and Dinamo Berlin in the quarter-finals. The semifinals pitted the Italians against Scottish outfit Dundee United. After losing the first leg 2–0, the Giallorossi won 3–0 in Roma, reaching the Final of the tournament for the first time in their history. The match against the three-time European Cup champion and heavy favourite Liverpool, though played in its home venue Stadio Olimpico, was won by the English squad after a penalty shoot-out, with the Roman squad being unable to field crucial players such as Maldera and Carlo Ancelotti.
Meanwhile, in June the squad won the Coppa Italia after defeating upcoming underdogs Hellas Verona:, which proved to be the last match for Swedish manager Nils Liedholm, who was appointed by Giuseppe Farina as the new head coach of A.C. Milan for the next season, including the departure of midfielder and captain Agostino Di Bartolomei.
