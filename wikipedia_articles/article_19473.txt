== Street Art ==
Growing up in the South Bronx during the 1980s, Moncho 1929 was inspired by the boon in urban art that occurred in Manhattan at that time. The work that he makes today incorporates the graffiti and street art aesthetic he grew up with while integrating more traditional techniques such a silkscreen and representational drawing. The content of his work shares the diversity of his techniques and addresses themes ranging from war to animal poaching to police brutality and celebrity obsession.
Moncho 1929's work has been exhibited in several solo and group shows at galleries including: LAB ART, The Gabba Gallery, Cheryl Hazan Contemporary Art, DTR Modern, Gallery 825, Soho House among others and featured in community-driven outdoor initiatives such as "Animal Alley LA."
