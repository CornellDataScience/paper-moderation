== Videography ==


=== PNC/Blueprint: A Mixed Media ===
Released 1996.
Available on VHS cassette in the UK only. A joint venture with the now defunct Panic Skateboards. The video is considered an important part of UK skateboarding history and documents some of the earliest footage in existence of some of the UK's most historically important skateboard spots.

Released 1999.
Promo video included at the end of 'Through the Eyes of Ruby'. This was originally meant to be Blueprint's 411 Industry section.


=== Waiting For The World ===
Released 2000.
Available on VHS cassette only. Waiting For The World really defined Blueprint as a team and opened everyone's eyes to the talent of the riders and what the UK has to offer.


=== First Broadcast ===
Released 2001.
Available on VHS cassette only, this release further displayed the skills and diversity of the team. This release also featured sections from Unabomber Skateboards and Organic Skateboards (Now Landscape Skateboards) as well as many of the companies friends.


=== The Belong Tour ===
Released 2002.
Available on VHS cassette only. This release covers the UK tour of the entire Blueprint team and is perhaps the least fondly remembered of their productions. The soundtrack includes tracks by Elliott Smith. The highlight of this video are the offcut clips of the team and friends street skating at the end of the tape.


=== Lost and Found ===
Released 2005.
Available in DVD format. The team travelled over Europe over two years in order to film their video parts. Lost And Found was then premiered to nearly 1000 skaters in London on March 12, 2005. The following 2-disc DVD set was released shortly after.
This DVD features the following riders: Danny Brady, Neil Smith, Scott Palmer, Ben Grove, Paul Shier, Vaughan Baker, Michael Wright, Colin Kennedy, Chewy Cannon, Mark Baines and Nick Jensen. Stephan Morgan, Tuukka Korhonen, Ste Thompson and Conhuir Lynn are featured in the credits. Paul Carter, John Fisher and John Rattray have easter egg sections.


=== Make Friends With Marty ===
Released 2010.
Online promotional clip, welcoming US pro rider Marty Murawski to the team and showcasing clips from the rest of the team. This clip acted as a teaser to the next full-length Blueprint DVD release, 'Make Friends With The Colour Blue'. Already-filmed footage of Marty couldn't be used in the forthcoming DVD due to camera compatibility issues, so this was a useful outlet for the footage.


=== Make Friends With The Colour Blue ===
Released 2010.
Available in DVD format. With the addition of two US riders (Marty Murawski and Kevin Coakley) introduced the brand officially to a new US audience. The resulting DVD, 'Make Friends With The Colour Blue' (commonly abbreviated to 'MFWTCB'), features a truly international line-up of team riders and is perhaps the most polished Blueprint production yet.
