== Biography ==
Katherine Perry was born on January 5, 1897. Although she spent a brief time in a private school, the bulk of Perry's education came in public schools.
Before she became an actress, Perry worked as a model. She was in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1911, 1917, 1918, 1919, and the more risqué Midnight Frolic show in 1918. Apart from the Follies, she also acted on Broadway in (From) Broadway to Paris, which ran from November 1912 to January 1913, The Passing Show of 1913, Robinson Crusoe, Jr. (1916), The Century Girl (1916-1917), and Miss 1917. Her final appearance on Broadway came in 1933, with Perry acting in Blackbirds of 1933 which ran throughout the month of December.
She made her film debut in Sooner or Later (1920). She next appeared in minor roles in The Chicken in the Case (1921) and Why Girls Leave Home (1921), in which she was billed as Mrs. Owen Moore. Her first starring role was in Fools and Riches (1923), starring alongside Herbert Rawlinson. Afterwards, she appeared in several short films before starring in Early to Wed (1926) with Matt Moore and Albert Gran and Blood Will Tell (1927).
In the 1930s, she was reduced to acting in uncredited roles. She played Clara Bow's maid in Call Her Savage (1932), and made her final screen appearance in 15 Maiden Lane (1936).
She was the second wife of Owen Moore. They married on July 16, 1921, in Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple acted in the films The Chicken in the Case (1921), A Divorce of Convenience (1921), Reported Missing (1922), Love Is an Awful Thing (1922), Husbands for Rent (1927), and Side Street (1929) together.
This confuses Kathryn Perry, the actress and film star, married to Owen Moore, with Kathryn Perry the singer, married to Earl Hines and star of Blackbirds of 1933.
