The 21st Canadian Parliament was in session from September 15, 1949, until June 13, 1953.  The membership was set by the 1949 federal election on June 27, 1949, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1953 election.
It was controlled by a Liberal Party majority under Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent and the 17th Canadian Ministry.  The Official Opposition was the Progressive Conservative Party, led by George Drew.
The Speaker was William Ross Macdonald.  See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1947-1952 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.
