== Geography ==
The whole of the district lies in the basin of the Lovat River. The Lovat crosses the district from south to north. The main tributary of the Lovat within the district is the Kunya (right). The town of Kholm is located at the confluence of the Lovat and the Kunya. The western part of the district is occupied by the Polist-Lovat Swamp System located at the border between the basins of the Lovat and the Polist Rivers. In the middle of the swamp, in the northwestern corner of the district, there is Lake Rdeyskoye, the biggest lake in the district and the source of the Redya River, a major left tributary of the Lovat. The Polist-Lovat Swamp System is protected as the Rdeysky Nature Reserve, which is shared between Kholmsky and Poddorsky Districts. 72% of the district's territory is covered by forests.


== History ==
The Lovat River was a part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, one of the oldest trading routes passing through Rus'. Kholm was first mentioned in an 1144 chronicle as Kholmsky Pogost. It was completely destroyed during the Livonian War of 1580-1581, but founded again at the same location in the 18th century. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. Kholm was included into Velikiye Luki Province. In 1777, Kholm was chartered and became the seat of Pskov Viceroyalty (from 1796—of Pskov Governorate).
On August 1, 1927, Pskov Governorate and its uyezds were abolished, and Kholmsky District was established as a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, with the administrative center in the town of Kholm. The district included parts of the former Kholmsky Uyezd. On June 3, 1929, Kholmsky District was transferred to Velikiye Luki Okrug of Western Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935, the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. Between August 1941 and spring of 1944, the area of the district was occupied by German troops. It was the scene of the Kholm Pocket from January 21 to May 5, 1942. On July 5, 1944, the district was transferred into newly established Novgorod Oblast, but already on August 22, 1944 it was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Kholmsky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast. On July 29, 1958, it was transferred back to Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since.
On August 1, 1927 Troitsky District was established as well. It included parts of former Velikoluksky and Kholmsky Uyezds, and the administrative center of the district was located in the selo of Troitsa-Khlavitsa. The district was a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, and on June 17, 1929 with the rest of the okrug it was transferred to Western Oblast. In August 1930, the district was renamed Lovatsky. On September 20, 1930 the district was abolished and split between Kholmsky and Loknyansky Districts.
Another district established on August 1, 1927 was Bologovsky District with the administrative center located in the selo of Bologovo. The district was a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, and on June 17, 1929 with the rest of the okrug it was transferred to Western Oblast. On September 20, 1930 the district was abolished and split between Kholmsky and Leninsky Districts.
On March 10, 1945, Podberezinsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Podberezye was established. It included parts of Loknyansky, Kholmsky, and Ploskoshsky Districts. The district was a part of Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, the district was transferred to Pskov Oblast.  On January 14, 1958, the district was abolished and split between Kholmsky, Loknyansky, Velikoluksky, and Ploskoshsky Districts.
