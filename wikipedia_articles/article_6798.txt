The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Ghana:
Ghana – sovereign country in West Africa in Africa.  The word "Ghana" means "Warrior King", and was the source of the name "Guinea" (via French Guinoye) used to refer to the West African coast (as in Gulf of Guinea). Ghana was inhabited in pre-colonial times by a number of ancient predominantly Akan kingdoms, foremost the Bono state, including the inland  Empire of Ashanti and various Fante states along the coast and inland. Trade with European states flourished after contact with the Portuguese in the 15th century, and the British established a crown colony, Gold Coast, in 1874. Upon achieving independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, the name Ghana was chosen for the new nation to reflect the ancient Empire of Ghana that once extended throughout much of Western Africa. In the Akan language it is spelled Gaana.
