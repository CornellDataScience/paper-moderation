== Album history ==
Işın Karaca worked for about seven years as back vocalist of Sezen Aksu. Sezen Aksu, a famous Turkish star, wanted to help her with her debut album, so the album is entirely produced by Aksu.
In the song "Lamba", piano is performed by Onno Tunç, a famous musician who died in a plane crash in 1996. The piano samples were originally performed in Zuhal Olcay's song "Kod Adım Leyla" in her Oyuncu album in 1996. The piano compositions are cleaned from the song and then added to "Lamba". The reason for that is; Sezen Aksu and Onno Tunç worked together and made very successful works in Turkey. Işın never met Onno Tunç, because Onno died just before Işın and Sezen met. So she missed the chance of working with Onno. And this become one of her wishes which was impossible after Onno's death. Aksu, who knows Işın's dream, ordered to clean the piano samples. The song was then arranged by Ayda Tunç, daughter of Onno. It was a surprise for Işın, because, Aksu didn't tell this to her unless the song was finished.
The song "Doğum Günün Kutlu Olsun Oğlum" (English: Happy birthday my son) was written by Sezen Aksu in Işın's house in mother's day. Sezen Aksu was returned from her visit to Italy. She was touched by the death fasts and then she wrote this song about the incidents.
