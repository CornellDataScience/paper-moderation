== Background ==
Matt's Scooter was a bay ridgeling bred by Max Gerson of New York. He was sired by Direct Scooter out of Ellen's Glory by Meadow Skipper. As a yearling, he was bought for $17,500 by Gordon and Illa Rumpel of Calgary, and Charles Juravinski. He was trained by Harry Poulton at his base near Lake Scugog, Ontario.


== Racing career ==
As  two-year-old, Matt's Scooter was given a relatively light campaign winning three of his nine races. He was not an easy horse to handle: Poulton described him as "always bucking, kicking or doing something... he wanted to do everything 100 miles an hour".
In 1988, despite being ineligible for the Cane Pace and the Little Brown Jug, Matt's Scooter earned $1.78 million winning eleven of his twenty two races. His major victories included the Meadowlands Pace and the Messenger Stakes.
In Autumn 1988, he paced a mile in 1:48.2 at the Red Mile in Lexington, Kentucky, lowering the world record previously held by Niatross, by four-fifths of a second.
As a four-year-old he won 23 of his thirty races and earned $1.14 million.


== Honors and awards ==
Matt's Scooter was named Pacer of the Year and best three-year-old in 1988. In the following year, he was again named best pacer and was awarded the title of Harness Horse of the Year. Matt's Scooter was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame and the United States Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2006.


== Retirement and stud career ==
He was retired from racing after 4 years, and stood as a breeding stallion for Perretti Farms in Cream Ridge, New Jersey. He was pensioned from stud duty in 2011. Bob Marks of Perretti Farms said "His libido is willing, but with his hind suspensory, we're afraid he could hurt himself".
Matt's Scooter was euthanised at Mid-Atlantic Equine Clinic in Ringoes, New Jersey on June 30, 2014.
