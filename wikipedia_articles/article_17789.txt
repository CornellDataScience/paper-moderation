== Controversies ==


=== Loss as a result of election rigging ===
In the 18 February 2008 elections, massive election rigging was conducted under the Musharraf's regime, in which case thousands of bogus and unregistered votes were cast in favour of the rival candidate Mr. Israr Tareen representing PMLQ. A political party that was being supported at the time by then President Pervez Musharraf's Government.
There were approximately 35000 unregistered votes cast against Sardar Nasar in that election by Pervez Musharraf's provincial government of the time. After a lengthy Court battle, Balochistan High Court ordered a recount. Upon  proof of approx. 350000 bogus and illegal votes of the rival candidate, Baluchistan High Court directed the Election Commission of Pakistan to reverse the original decision and declare Sardar Nasar as winner. Sardar Yaqoob Khan Nasar than returned to the National Assembly seat on representing the people of his constituency.
