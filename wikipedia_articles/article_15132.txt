Charlotte Motor Speedway (known as Lowe's Motor Speedway from 1999 to 2009 due to sponsorship reasons) is a 1.500-mile (2.414 km) quad-oval intermediate speedway in Concord, North Carolina. It has hosted various major races since its inaugural season of racing in 1960, including NASCAR, IndyCar, and IMSA SportsCar Championship races. The facility is currently owned by Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI), with Greg Walter serving as its general manager. Charlotte Motor Speedway is served by U.S. Route 29. 
The speedway has a capacity of 95,000 as of 2021. The track features numerous amenities, including a Speedway Club, condos, and a seven-story tower located on the complex for office space and souvenirs. In addition, the Charlotte Motor Speedway complex features numerous adjacent tracks, including a 1⁄5 mile (0.32 km) clay short track, a 2⁄5 mile (0.64 km) dirt track, and a 1⁄4 mile (0.40 km) long drag strip. The main track also features an infield road course that is used with the oval to make a "roval".  
With the rise of popularity in stock car racing in the American Southeast that began in the late 1940s and stretched into the 1950s, racing promoter Bruton Smith sought to build a state-of-the-art facility. At the same time, driver and businessman Curtis Turner sought to do the same. After initially refusing, Turner eventually partnered with Smith after they agreed to sell shares needed for the track's construction. Charlotte Motor Speedway was constructed in less than 11 months. The facility immediately faced a litany of issues, particularly financial woes. Within the facility's first decade of existence, ownership changed hands numerous times, with Smith and Turner both leaving. After a period of stability under the ownership of Richard Howard from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, Smith and his new partner, racing promoter and eventual longtime track general manager Humpy Wheeler, completed a takeover of Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1976. Since then, the Smith family and their company, SMI, have directed the facility's expansion and growth into one of the largest sports facilities in the United States.


== Description ==


=== Configurations ===
Charlotte Motor Speedway (CMS) in its current form is measured at 1.5 miles (2.4 km), with 24 degrees of banking in the turns and five degrees of banking on the track's frontstretch and backstretch. Within the main track's frontstretch, there is a 1⁄4 mile (0.40 km) oval that was built in 1991 and is primarily used for legends car racing.
Numerous tracks exist in the track's infield. In 1970, track officials announced plans for an infield road course that was connected to the speedway's backstretch. According to then-general manager Richard Howard, original plans for the speedway included a road course, but this was cut due to budget issues. The original road course's length has varied in reports, from as short as 1.75 miles (2.82 km) according to the Salisbury Post to as long 1.9 miles (3.1 km) long according to The Charlotte Observer. The road course held its first races on May 22, 1971, as part of the 1971 World 600 race weekend. By August 1974, the track was reconfigured to a length of 2.25 miles (3.62 km). In 2018, the road course was modified to suit NASCAR racing, adding a backstretch chicane. this was modified the following year In 2019, one of the speedway's chicanes, located on the backstretch, was modified. In 2020, developers constructed a purpose-built go-kart track in the track's infield. Further modifications to two of the road course's chicanes were announced in 2024.


=== Amenities ===
CMS is located in Concord, North Carolina, directly next to U.S. Route 29. At the time of CMS's initial construction, the complex covered 551 acres (223 ha) and had a capacity of around 30,000. Over the span of several decades, CMS and its complex have been expanded and improved numerous times. Throughout the ownership of Bruton Smith, the facility oversaw capacity growth, seeing a peak of over 170,000 by the end of the 1980s. However, since the 2000s, capacity has seen a decrease, with multiple grandstands being demolished in the 2010s; as of 2021, the track is reported to have a capacity of 95,000. The complex has also expanded to around 2,000 acres (810 ha) as of 2020. 
Numerous buildings, used for a variety of purposes, are located in the complex. In 1983, to celebrate the facility's 25th anniversary, officials announced the construction of 36 condominiums that were built to overlook CMS's first turn. By the time the project was completed in mid-1984, the number of condos increased to 40, and all were sold by the end of 1983. At the end of 1984, officials announced the construction of a mall underneath the condos. Three years later, officials announced the construction of a members-only private club and restaurant named The Speedway Club, with annual membership starting at $6,500 (adjusted for inflation, $17,432).


==== Adjacent tracks ====
The Charlotte Motor Speedway complex has two adjacent tracks and a drag strip near the main speedway. By July 1993, construction started on a 1⁄5 mile (0.32 km) clay short track that was made to conduct dirt legends car races. On August 10, 1999, then-general manager Humpy Wheeler announced a new 3⁄8 mile (0.60 km) dirt track that was to be constructed across the main speedway. By January 2000, the planned track had been extended to 2⁄5 mile (0.64 km). The first races on this track, which featured a lighting system and a capacity of 15,000, were held on May 28, 2000.
In August 2007, owner of Speedway Motorsports, Bruton Smith, announced plans to build a drag strip on the complex. Although the plan initially faced heavy opposition from local politicians, the drag strip was eventually built after Smith threatened to close down the speedway, coercing the city to give him an incentive package of approximately $80 million by leveraging fears that a closure would cripple the Concord economy. The drag strip, which cost $60 million to build, held its first races in September 2008.


== History ==


=== Planning and construction ===

Stock car racing, with its origins tracing back to moonshiners during the Prohibition era, became increasingly popular within the American Southeast throughout the 1940s and 1950s. With this rise, new modern tracks, such as Darlington Raceway, were built across the Southeast. In the late 1950s, Bruton Smith, a promoter who had found major success promoting races across the Carolinas, sought to build his own racetrack. In 1956, he partnered with businessman John William Propst Jr. to build a racetrack. At the same time, driver and successful timber businessman Curtis Turner sought to do the same, collaborating with a group of businessmen. In 1958, Propst suffered a heart attack, backing out of the partnership due to health issues. Consequently, Smith sought to partner with Turner. After a few weeks of initial success, in a meeting at the Barringer Hotel, Turner declined the partnership. For numerous reasons, including the feeling of betrayal, the fact that Turner did not have enough funds to start his own track, and knowing that the city of Charlotte could only support one track, Smith announced his intention to build his own speedway to bluff Turner's plans on April 22, 1959, the same day Turner announced his track. On May 8, Turner announced the track would be built bordering U.S. Route 29, inside of Cabarrus County, North Carolina, with a capacity of 30,000. However, Turner struggled to sell the 300,000 shares needed. Turner eventually agreed to partner with Smith, with Smith becoming the vice president of the project and selling 100,000 shares. Additional stocks to be sold were added in December 1959 and April 1960. 
Groundbreaking on the facility commenced on July 28, 1959. It was meant to start two months earlier, but was delayed due to legal issues relating to the land's purchase. The project was immediately plagued with construction issues. The crew who worked on the track discovered large veins of granite underneath the soil shortly after groundbreaking. To remove it, grading contractor W. Owen Flowe decided to blast it with dynamite, causing delays. In addition, aggressive hornets led to multiple workers quitting. In March 1960, three snowstorms delayed construction even further; although, the track's publicity director insisted that its construction was "still ahead of schedule". By the end of March, developers considered scrapping plans for grandstands to save time. The issues caused the track's first major race, the NASCAR-sanctioned 1960 World 600, to be delayed from its original date on May 29 to June 19. Longtime NASCAR mechanic Smokey Yunick called the construction location "a giant mistake. If they'd have searched North Carolina for the worst possible place to build a racetrack, that's where they built it." Smith blames Turner for the delays; according to Smith, Turner would commonly hire people while under the influence of alcohol, with Smith having to turn them away. Despite these issues, the project saw additional funding and a $300,000 (adjusted for inflation, $3,089,764) loan from Washington D.C. businessman James L. McIlvaine, who was so confident that the project would succeed that he stated in The Charlotte Observer, "This is going to be one of the best investments I've ever made, and I've made some good ones."
Nearing the end of the facility's construction, a contract dispute formed between Flowe and his workers, citing unpaid fees and bounced checks. On June 9, days before the World 600, Flowe parked several earthmovers on the track and stopped construction, with Flowe threatening to sue CMS officials. Disputing accounts exist of what happened to suppress this action; according to Flowe, numerous people, including Smith and Turner, threatened to shoot him and his workers if they did not continue working. According to Smith, only Turner showed up with a shotgun and proceeded to "[act] like he was somebody" before a guard took away his gun. Eventually, construction resumed, though it was barely completed by the first days of activities for the 1960 World 600. In later interviews, Smith called it a "miracle" CMS was built, having admitted to losing $150,000 building it. CMS cost around two million dollars (adjusted for inflation, $20,598,425) according to McIlvaine, with $74,000 (adjusted for inflation, $762,142) in debts owed to Flowe by the end of its initial construction.


=== Early track and financial troubles ===
CMS officially opened to cars for a practice session on June 15, 1960. Immediately, CMS saw issues. During the facility's first day, incomplete facilities were reported by The State. To further compound problems, the asphalt had several holes due to speeds of approximately 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) on the track's surface. The issue had gotten so prevalent that Charlotte Observer writer George Cunningham reported that "four gravel-deep fox holes grew... out of the second turn. And practically the entire surface on the third and fourth turns resembled an old lady's wrinkled face". However, some hoped that the surface would cure at faster speeds, including driver Glenn "Fireball" Roberts. Track leaders ordered a hasty repave of the track, and by the next day, most of the track's surface held up. On June 18, more financial problems ensued; track officials were sued by Roy E. Thomas, who sold advertising space in souvenir programs, for $10,000 (adjusted for inflation, $102,992) for breach of contract because he was fired. On race day, Smith began to pray that the race would go over halfway so he would not have to give out refunds. During the race itself, track surface issues resurfaced; numerous mechanical problems, including blown tires, broken axles, suspensions giving out, and other problems were reported by drivers such as Tom Pistone, Doug Yates, and Ned Jarrett due to the track's rough surface. Another driver, Emanuel Zervakis, stated, "It's rough as hell! All the cars will have to be rebuilt... there's no doubt about it". In addition, the surface was reported to have come apart in numerous areas, with drivers having to avoid flying pieces of asphalt during the race. Max Muhlehurn, writer for The Charlotte News, stated that "The 600 will go down in history as the only race ever run in which drivers were forced to dodge track blemishes more often than other cars".
On July 17, McIlvaine spread rumors that the facility's board of directors would appoint new management, under either NASCAR president Bill France Sr. or Darlington Raceway president Bob Colvin. The rumor was repudiated by both Smith and Turner, with the latter threatening legal action. Within the next couple months, numerous claims of Smith and Turner owing money to various groups and companies were made, including $90,000 (adjusted for inflation, $926,929) to the Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., $40,200 (adjusted for inflation, $414,028) to the Internal Revenue Service, $65,000 (adjusted for inflation, $669,449) to Propst and his construction company, and $204,000 (adjusted for inflation, $2,101,039) to McDevitt Street and Co. The facility also was found to have defaulted on its initial mortgage. By early August, only Propst had been paid off, with further repaves being scheduled to fix track surface issues. On November 22, CMS was reported to have amassed around $1 million (adjusted for inflation, $10,299,213) in debts. Two more lawsuits were filed in January 1961 by excavating companies.
On March 1, 1961, Flowe filed a civil action lawsuit against the track, claiming breach of contract and seeking $138,155.28 (adjusted for inflation, $1,408,630) in reparations for construction costs. Three months later, as of result of McIlvaine threatening the foreclosure and subsequent auction of CMS, Turner and Smith resigned from the board of directors, with Smith staying as a promotional director. Board of directors member Duke Ellington replaced Turner as the track's general manager. Turner later accused Smith and Ellington on conspiring to oust him, along with stating inflated profits. In July, Turner and his investor group announced plans to regain control of CMS by either buying the track in a public sale or accumulating enough stock. In August, even though CMS experienced an "unusually successful" 1961 World 600, they warned stockholders that the facility was in "serious trouble and can only gain financial stability through the arrangement of long-term financing immediately". In the beginning of October, with the facility still having $500,000 in debt, foreclosure proceedings began, with the track being planned to be sold at auction on October 30. In attempts to stop this, numerous solutions were brought up, including plans to seek a "miracle" loan and another separate plan that involved Smith partnering with investors to raise $600,000 to save the facility. After the auction was delayed, on November 3, James Braxton Craven Jr., a judge for the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, ruled to let the district court take over and manage the track and let CMS enter Chapter 10 bankruptcy, with all officers and directors being removed from their positions. The facility was also protected from creditors by the court, essentially becoming a ward.


==== Federal court control ====

After Craven's ruling, he appointed Robert Nelson Robinson, a local Charlotte lawyer, to run the track. Numerous loan offers to pull the facility out of its financial woes, including separate offers from businessmen Roger D. Edwards and Dwight Cross, were made. On December 9, Craven ruled to let the track's management find loans without the pressure of creditors demanding money, with Robinson being ordered to come up with a plan to ensure the $900,000 (adjusted for inflation, $9,176,392) payment to various creditors. By the beginning of January 1962, however, no progress was made, leading to threats from Craven to liquidate the track by March if no plan was made. By the end of the month, a shareholder committee, headed by A. C. Goines, planned to ask the track's nearly 2,300 shareholders to buy trustee certificates, ranging in value from $100 to $1,000; this would raise $300,000, half of the $600,000 needed to start reorganization. After a "wonderful" initial stockholder meeting on February 18, a last-ditch effort was scheduled to raise $50,000 six days later. On the day of the meeting, the committee was successful in raising the $300,000 needed. However, a loan offered by Cross to cover the remaining debts was rejected. By May, Craven ordered an investigation of CMS. By July, although Craven was convinced the facility could be saved, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was asked to assist with the investigation due to preliminary findings of mismanagement and potential fraud. Eventually, a reorganization plan hearing was set for November 5.
In October, a new $345,000 loan from McIlvaine was guaranteed despite track officials owing McIlvaine over $300,000, relieving more financial pressure. The next month, Craven approved Robinson's proposal to let stockholders and creditors vote on a reorganization plan from December to January 3, 1963. Although the plan initially did not receive enough support from creditors, it was eventually approved, with Craven giving final approval for a stock sale in February. By April, the plan saw major success, with the owners repaying over $740,000 of debt. In mid-April, Craven allowed private ownership under an 11-person board of directors led by A. C. Goines. This was to last for at least one year, completing the reorganization process. That same year, Bruton Smith left his job after being found guilty of failing to properly file tax returns in 1955 and 1956.


=== Richard Howard era, stabilization ===
In December 1963, Goines declared while announcing a 10% stock dividend, "We've taken some bitter medicine, but the patient has been saved". In February 1964, CMS saw a profit for the first time. He resigned after the mandatory one-year period, with his position being filled by leading stockholder Richard Howard, a furniture store owner. The track later oversaw numerous driver fatalities in the mid-1960s; longtime driver Fireball Roberts died on July 2, 1964, due to complications from a fiery crash at the 1964 World 600, and Harold Kite, a World War II veteran, died on October 17, 1965, during the 1965 National 400 in a crash on the race's first lap.
Under the leadership of Howard, CMS was able to pay off its mortgage three years early, finally ending the last of the track's financial woes. Throughout Howard's tenure, he was seen as a "good ol' country boy" who spent conservatively on the track; however, he was willing to renovate parts of the track and increase its capacity. In 1965, track officials opted to diversify their holdings, buying out the Rightway Investment Corporation, an insurance finance company. In 1970, track management announced constructions of a new road course, along with new grandstands according to tax records. By 1972, CMS was increasing their profits year-by-year.


=== Bruton Smith and Humpy Wheeler's takeover ===

In the mid-1970s, after a successful stint in the car dealership business, Smith began to believe that reacquiring CMS would be an highly profitable venture, with the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and its subsidiary Winston introducing their sponsorship of the NASCAR Cup Series in 1970. By 1973, Smith bought almost 500,000 shares – a more than tenfold increase from his initial amount of 40,000 – stating that he did not know why he bought this many. In early 1974, despite an attempt to stop elections for the track's board of directors, Smith was elected as chairman, effectively placing him back in charge. Howard was elected as the facility's president. Later that year, Howard announced a $2.5 million (adjusted for inflation, $15,445,344) renovation of the track, aimed at improving the physical appearance of the track and adding seating.

Throughout 1975, Howard and Smith had heated exchanges in the media, entering a fierce battle for control. In January, Howard regained control of the board of directors despite threatening to resign. In early February, Howard stated that he was tired of the track being run from Illinois, where Smith lived. In response, Smith accused him of consolidating too much power along with financial irregularities. In July, Smith bought around 80,000 shares from Howard's relatives, which was considered a major turning point in their battle for control. On August 29, H. A. "Humpy" Wheeler, a former public relations representative for various companies, was hired as the track's development director. With this, Howard felt his position was threatened, with local media predicting that Wheeler's hiring was the final piece needed for a total takeover by Smith. On October 5, The Atlanta Constitution reported that the 1975 National 500 was to be Howard's final race with any ties with the facility, with a final decision to come on January 30, 1976, the day of the annual stockholders' meeting. Although Howard initially denied these claims and later professed interest in taking a consultant job with Smith, on October 23 Howard stated that he was "99% certain" of leaving. On the day of the stockholders' meeting, a tearful Howard officially announced his resignation, essentially giving Smith full control over the facility, with Wheeler filling in as president.


==== Humpy Wheeler era, promotions, failed NFL proposal ====
Under the leadership of Wheeler and Smith, CMS was extensively promoted and rapidly expanded and modernized. In Wheeler's first year as president, he announced a $3–5 million renovation that was to be completed in 1981. Wheeler became known in the following years for pulling off elaborate and unique promotions. In 1976, he convinced Janet Guthrie to enter the 1976 World 600 to attract female spectators. In 1977, to promote a rivalry between longtime driver Cale Yarborough and newcomer Darrell Waltrip, he created a contraption that poked fun at Waltrip's nickname, "Jaws", and Yarborough's sponsor, Holly Farms Poultry. Wheeler placed a dead chicken inside the mouth of a dead shark, attached it to a pickup truck's sling, and paraded it before first qualifying round of the 1977 NAPA National 500. In 1980, officials announced further renovations worth $16 million, with a stated goal of bringing the speedway's capacity to 150,000. In 1983, Bruton and Wheeler announced the construction of 36 condominiums; the number later increased for 40, and despite initial mockery all were sold by the dwellings' completion in 1984.
In 1985, the city of Charlotte sought to attract a professional football team. In March, Smith announced plans to build a stadium on the track's frontstretch, with a capacity of 76,000, temporary endzone grandstands, and retractable grandstand seating behind the track's pit road. Original plans for the track had included a football stadium, but this had been scrapped due to numerous construction issues. During the official announcement on March 13, Smith stated that he would build the stadium if either the local government or investors gave him $10 million. Competition for this bid came from fellow Charlotte businessman George Shinn, who wanted either a team for the National Football League (NFL) or the fledgling United States Football League (USFL); Smith, conversely, only wanted an NFL team. The city refused to assist with construction costs, and all plans died by the end of the year; however, Smith did state renewed interest of hosting an NFL team at the track two years later.


==== Mass expansion and improvement, injury-riddled period ====

In 1987, construction began on a membership-exclusive club and restaurant named The Speedway Club. By the end of the 1980s, CMS had a maximum capacity of 170,922. In 1991, Smith directed the installation of lights at the track with the help of Iowa-based Musco Lighting. At the time, it was viewed as a major feat, as no oval track as large as the Charlotte Motor Speedway had ever implemented such a system. The lights were completed in April 1992. In 1994, the track renovated its garage area at a cost of around $1 million, drawing praise from driver Dale Jarrett. In 1999, the track partnered with hardware retail chain Lowe's, which bought naming rights, the first time a corporate sponsor ever had such rights for a track.
Throughout the 1990s and the early 2000s, numerous injuries and fatalities occurred at the track, involving both drivers and spectators. In 1989, Wheeler created the NASCAR Sportsman Division, a series that had the intended goal of giving short-track drivers experience on longer tracks. The track played host to numerous races. The series immediately gained a reputation for danger due to a series of crashes at CMS. Three fatal crashes occurred within six years; David Gaines in 1990, Gary Batson in 1992, and Russell Phillips in 1995, with the third being decapitated when his head hit a caution light. In late 1995, Wheeler gave control of the series to NASCAR, who ended it quickly afterward in 1996. During the 1999 VisionAire 500K – an Indy Racing League race – an early accident involving Stan Wattles and John Paul Jr. occurred on the speedway's front stretch, resulting in heavy debris. Wattles' right rear wheel and tire assembly flew into the grandstands at high speeds, killing three people and injuring eight more, resulting in the cancellation of the race. After the 2000 The Winston, a pedestrian bridge collapsed, injuring 107 people, which was later blamed on the bridge's manufacturer using an improper additive. In the next two years, two ARCA drivers died in accidents; Blaise Alexander in 2001, and Eric Martin in 2002.

In 2005, officials announced a repave, using a process called levigation to smooth out bumps on the track's surface. This repave led to numerous problems for both of the facility's NASCAR race weekends in 2005, leading to another repave in 2006. In 2007, Smith announced plans to construct a drag strip. This plan was met with heavy criticism from the Concord City Council, which held a special legislative session to decide whether to block it. Smith, in turn, decided to start preliminary grading work regardless of the council's decision. On October 2, the council voted unanimously to block Smith's plans. In response, Smith threatened to shut down the track or relegate it to a testing facility unless the decision was reversed, which would have significant financial repercussions for the Concord economy. The council quickly backtracked, and tried to convince Smith to stay by offering him an incentive package of $80 million (adjusted for inflation, $117,554,165), a street named in his honor, and a tax break, along with letting him build the drag strip. On November 26, Smith stated his final decision in letting the track continue as is, stating, "We're here forever".


=== Retirement of Wheeler ===
Tensions between Smith and Wheeler had been documented since 1991, with the two being in "constant disagreement" over topics. By 2008, Wheeler grew angry at several new developments directed by Smith, including the controversial drag strip. On May 21, 2008, Wheeler announced his retirement, effective after the 2008 Coca-Cola 600, ending a tenure that had lasted since 1975. Although Smith claimed that he offered Wheeler a consulting job and that Wheeler himself hoped for a part-time position, Wheeler ultimately left all track duties related to CMS. Wheeler was replaced by Marcus Smith, one of Smith's sons. In 2009, corporate sponsor Lowe's ended its eleven-year partnership with the track, which reverted back to the "Charlotte Motor Speedway" name.


==== Steady attendance declines, renovations ====

Throughout the 2010s, CMS oversaw steady attendance declines that correlated with overall reduced attendance within NASCAR. As a result, officials ordered the removal of 41,000 seats in 2014 and an unspecified amount of seats in 2017. In 2017, the track was used for the filming of the movie Logan Lucky, a fictional tale about a group of people stealing $14 million from the facility. In 2018, Marcus stepped down from general manager responsibilities to focus on running SMI as its CEO, handing the position over to the speedway's executive vice president at the time, Greg Walter. In interviews, Walter expressed a desire for expanding the CMS's uses for endeavors other than racing, along with further renovations. In 2021, the NASCAR All-Star Race, which had been held at the track annually, with two exceptions in 1986 and 2020, was moved to the Texas Motor Speedway in an attempt to reverse sagging attendance at Texas.
CMS has seen numerous renovations and additions since the 2010s. In 2011, Marcus directed the construction of a 200-by-800-foot (61 by 244 m) television screen on the track's backstretch, demolishing old seats in the process. In 2015, the track's barriers were renovated in response to Kyle Busch's injury at the Daytona International Speedway in February. In 2023, officials announced plans to build a dedicated road course.

==== NASCAR ====

Since 1960, Charlotte Motor Speedway has held two annual NASCAR Cup Series races per year: the World 600 (known as the Coca-Cola 600 for sponsorship reasons) and the Bank of America Roval 400. Upon the former's inaugural iteration, it became one of the longest, largest, and highest-paying motor races in the world, becoming a staple on the NASCAR schedule and one of its "crown jewel" events.
The Bank of America Roval 400, meanwhile, was formerly a 500-mile (800 km) race commonly known as the National 500, which was run in October and first run in 1960. In 1966, the race distance increased to 501 miles (806 km), which remained until 2018. In 2018, in attempts to reverse declining attendance, the race both decreased to 400 kilometres (250 miles) and was run on a specialized "roval" course. Along with its Cup Series races, CMS also hosts lower-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Truck Series races.
In 1985, Wheeler and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company directed the creation of The Winston (now called the NASCAR All-Star Race), a race that featured race winners of the previous season. From 1987 until 2020, CMS ran the event annually, with various changes to its format and eligibility rules over time. The race was moved in 2020 to the Bristol Motor Speedway due to COVID-19 restrictions. In 2021, the race officially moved to the Texas Motor Speedway to reverse declining attendance at Texas.


==== Other racing events ====

In late 1979, the United States Auto Club (USAC) announced plans to run a 500 kilometres (310 mi) race in October 1980. However, the race was canceled in April due to an agreement with USAC and Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). In December 1996, IndyCar announced plans for a race to be held in July 1997. The race ran for three years; the last race was canceled after an accident caused flying debris that killed three spectators.
Numerous runnings of the Grand Prix of Charlotte, a sports car event, have been run by various organizations. In 2000, the facility held a one-off Grand Prix of Charlotte that was sanctioned by the American Le Mans Series. The race was last run in 2020 by the IMSA SportsCar Championship.


=== Non-racing events ===


==== Festivals and shows ====
On August 10, 1974, CMS hosted the August Jam. Regarded as "Carolina's Woodstock", the festival drew over 200,000 people, more than double than what was expected due to a security breach. The festival unintentionally became the largest music festival in North Carolina history. It soon gained a reputation for violence; Richard Howard, president of CMS, compared the actions of spectators to Japanese Army suicide attacks at the Battle of Okinawa, with damages totaling $50,000.
From 2013 to 2018, the facility held the Carolina Rebellion festival. Since 2021, CMS has hosted a branch of the touring Breakaway Festival.
