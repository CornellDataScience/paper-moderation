"Outlines – Albert Firth – Albert is one of many players on our present register who commenced his career as a member of the Wakefield City Schools' side. Unlike the majority, however he had to seek his Rugby League football at that stage, for his school in Stanley did not play Rugby. Whilst with the Wakefield City Schools' team he gained County honours against Cumberland. In those days he played in the forwards; a number of occasions being at loose forward. Schooldays over, he naturally joined his local team – Stanley Rangers – for whom he made several appearances at centre three-quarter. In whichever position he played, however, his work was so successful that Trinity secured his signature at sixteen years of age. Albert signed for Wakefield Trinity in July, 1953 and, after a short period in the "A” team, made his senior début in November, 1953 against Huddersfield here at Belle Vue. There was another appearance in the senior team during that season, but in the following campaign he made his mark and from there he has not looked back. In his first full season of 1954–5, he made thirty appearances and scored 13 tries – his most successful term until this present season. In September he made his County début for Yorkshire against Cumberland at Hull and there are strong hopes that this will form only the first of many similar representative appearances. Still only in his early twenties, with 127 first team appearances (and over forty tries) behind him, he still has much to give Trinity in the important seasons ahead. The continuance of his career and the further fulfilment of much promise will be watched with interest and satisfaction"
