The Liberty Hockey One is a field hockey competition organised by Hockey Australia, which replaced the Australian Hockey League.
Dual competitions are conducted for both men's and women's teams, with parallel fixtures for both competitions throughout the regular season. The league serves as Australia's premier domestic hockey league, helping unearth future talent for selection to the Australian national teams; the Kookaburras and Hockeyroos.
The NSW Pride and the Brisbane Blaze are currently the most successful teams, winning three out of six titles each. The Pride won both the men's and women's competitions in 2022, whereas the Blaze won both competitions in 2023.  


== History ==
The Hockey One League was founded on 17 April 2019. The tournament was formed following an overhaul of the Australian Hockey League, and replaced the tournament to serve as Australia's premier hockey competition.
Following a series of rule innovations during the 2018 men's and women's AHL tournaments, Hockey Australia made the decision to disband the premier competition, making way for the new domestic league.
On 23 September 2019, Hockey Australia confirmed that the new league had secured a major partnership with Kellogg's, with naming rights also afforded to the company, forming the Sultana Bran Hockey One League. The sponsorship was for the first two seasons, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic extended through to the 2022 (second) season. The following day it was confirmed that Westfund Health Insurance had been named as a supporting partner. 
On 11 September 2023, the league announced Jamie Dwyer Hockey (JDH) as the new official naming rights partner, with the 2023 (third) season named the JDH Hockey One League.
On 24 September 2024, Liberty was announced as naming rights partner, officially renaming the league to the Liberty Hockey One League for season four (2024).


=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Following a successful first season of the Sultana Bran Hockey One in 2019, the second edition was anticipated for commencement in late 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league's second season was postponed until 2021. The decision was made by the Hockey One board on 24 March 2020 following consultations with Hockey Australia and the seven member associations in the league, all of which being unable to financially support the program later in the year.
The postponement was not only made to benefit associations financially, but also on account of restrictions put into place by the Government of Australia, which prohibited mass-gatherings and sporting events. The league went on to postpone the second season to October 2022, owing to divergent state border restrictions in place across the country in late 2021.


== Format ==
Seven teams will compete in a round-robin tournament with home and away matches, played from late September to mid November, with the top four teams advancing to the finals round at a pre-determined location.


=== Teams ===
The seven teams to compete in the Sultana Bran Hockey One come from Australia's states and territories, with the Northern Territory being the only team absent.
