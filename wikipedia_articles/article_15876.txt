== History ==


=== Early history ===
The Prince Edward Island Light Horse was first authorized on 1 June 1901, as an independent squadron in the Non-Permanent Active Militia component of the Canadian Mounted Rifles. On 16 February 1914, it was granted full regimental status after an additional squadron was established in Summerside, PEI. A few months later on 1 April 1914, the regiment was redesignated as the 36th Prince Edward Island Light Horse.
On 15 March 1920, as a result of the Canadian Militia reforms following the Otter Commission, the regiment was simply redesignated as The Prince Edward Island Light Horse.


=== Second World War ===
During the Second World War, the PEI Light Horse on 27 February 1941 mobilized an armoured squadron which formed the Headquarters Squadron of the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade. They would later on 1 November 1943 be reorganized as the 2nd Canadian Corps Defence Company (The Prince Edward Island Light Horse). On 6 July 1944, the PEI Light Horse landed in France and served as part of the II Canadian Corps until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.
The youngest Canadian soldier to die in the Second World War, 14-year-old Robert Cyril Claude Brooks was a member of the 17th (Reserve) Armoured Regiment (Prince Edward Island Light Horse). He was killed in a training accident near Coleman, Prince Edward Island, at approximately 7:30 pm on 23 September 1944, when a Universal Carrier was driven through a guard rail on a bridge, overturning into the water below. He was trapped beneath the overturned vehicle and drowned, along with two fellow members of the regiment, Sergeant D.C. Ramsay and Trooper W.N. Dennis.


=== Postwar ===
On 1 April, 1946, The Prince Edward Island Light Horse was amalgamated with The Prince Edward Island Highlanders to form the 17th (Prince Edward Island) Reconnaissance Regiment (now The Prince Edward Island Regiment (RCAC)).
