Newhall  is the southernmost and oldest community in the city of Santa Clarita, California.  Prior to the 1987 consolidation of Canyon Country, Saugus, Newhall, and Valencia into the city of Santa Clarita, it was an unincorporated area.  It was the first permanent town in the Santa Clarita Valley.


== History ==
The Tataviam village of Tochonanga was located at the area where Newhall stands today. Fifty villagers were brought to Mission San Fernando from 1797 to 1811. Descendants of the village continued to live in the Newhall area.

Named after businessman Henry Mayo Newhall, Newhall is home to the William S. Hart Regional Park, featuring tours of the famous silent movie maker's mansion. Newhall is also home to the Pioneer Oil Refinery (California Historical Landmark, No. 172), the oldest surviving oil refinery in the world and the first commercially successful refinery in California. Over the years, Newhall has been the location for many movies, including Suddenly (1954) and Disney's The World's Greatest Athlete (1973). The TV series The Magnificent Seven was also for the most part filmed in Newhall.
The Lyons Station Stagecoach Stop was located at what is now Eternal Valley Cemetery near the intersection of Newhall Avenue and Sierra Highway in east Newhall.
On April 6, 1970, four California Highway Patrol officers were shot dead during a traffic stop of two heavily armed career criminals. The incident was known as the Newhall incident, although it took place in present-day Valencia. This led to increased emphasis on officer safety both within the CHP and nationwide.


== Education ==
The Master's University, a non-denominational Christian liberal arts university, is located in Newhall.
At the elementary school level, Newhall is almost entirely served by the Newhall School District, except for the far northeastern portion (bordering Canyon Country) which is served by the Sulphur Springs School District. At the middle and high school levels, Newhall is served by Placerita and La Mesa Junior High Schools, and Hart and Golden Valley High Schools, all part of the William S.
