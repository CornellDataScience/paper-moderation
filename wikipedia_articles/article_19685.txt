Belmond–Klemme Community School District serves the community.
The original brick classroom building was constructed in 1914, with the gymnasium addition added in 1949. In 1962 the state forced there merger of the Rowan School District with the Belmond Community School District. The high school students began attending Belmond in the fall of 1962, with the junior high moving in 1963. A grade school was continued until 1971, when the school was closed. The original 1914 brick classrooms were demolished in 1977. The 1949 gymnasium structure has been renovated over the years to become the Rowan Events Center. Owned by the City of Rowan, the gymnasium is now used as the Iowa River Players Community Theatre. The lower level houses a community room for events throughout the year, such as the Legion Fish Fry and the Lions Chicken Barbecue.    Belmond–Klemme CSD formed on July 1, 1994, with the merger of the Belmond and Klemme districts.
Today, the Belmond–Klemme School District has a K–12 enrollment of about 700 students.
