Nazareth College is an independent  Roman Catholic comprehensive co-educational secondary day school, located in Noble Park North, a south eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
Established in 1986, the college currently caters for approximately 800 students in Year 7 through to Year 12.


== History ==
Nazareth was established in 1986 through the collaboration of four local parish primary-level schools: St Elizabeth's in Noble Park North, St Gerard's in Dandenong North, St Justin's in Wheelers Hill and St Simon's in Rowville. At the time, it was seen that there was a need for a local regional college following the Catholic tradition and hence, Nazareth College was formed to cater to students from the four parishes. A majority of the students at Nazareth College are graduates of one of the parish schools listed above.
Nazareth college has a day to celebrate the school called "Naz Day" in September. Each pastoral room hosts an activity and hires food trucks or a ride. For the whole school day, the school is transformed into a fun fair. Toward the end, around 1:00, founding members return to the school for a full assembly and give a speech.  Then the school talent show, consisting mostly of musical performances, begins.  After that, school is dismissed.
Nazareth College's past principals have been:

Paul D'Astoli (1986–1996)
Gregory Clarke (1997–2006)
Anne McDonald (2007–2016)
Sam Cosentino (2017–present)

Nazareth College comprises a Middle School and Senior School. Middle School caters for the students in Years 7–9 and the Senior School caters for the students in 10–12.
