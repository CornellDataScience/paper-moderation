Jamaluddin bin Mohd Radzi is a Malaysian politician. He was the state assemblyman for Behrang. In early 2009, along with Mohd Osman Mohd Jailu and Hee Yit Fong, he resigned from the People's Justice Party (PKR) to sit as an independent, supporting the fall of the Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin-led government and precipitating the 2009 Perak Constitutional crisis.


== Early career ==
Jamaluddin was a postman and was in the business sector before joining politics.


== Political career ==
He contested the Behrang seat two times. In the 2004 Malaysian general election, he lost to the MIC candidate, Appalannaldu Rajoo. In the 2008 Malaysian general election he won against the MIC candidate, Ramasamy Muthusamy. He was a candidate to be Menteri Besar (First Minister) of Perak following the election, but Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin from PAS was chosen.


=== 2009 Perak constitutional crisis ===
During the 2009 Perak Constitutional Crisis, Jamaluddin together with Mohd Osman Mohd Jailu and Hee Yit Fong declared themselves independent state assemblymen and supported Barisan Nasional to establish a new state government. In the 2013 Perak state elections, although Jamaluddin considered to defend his Behrang seat as an independent, he decided to not contest and lend his support to Barisan Nasional candidate Rusnah Kassim.


=== Attempt to join BERSATU ===
On 15 May 2018, the by-then Menteri Besar of Perak, Ahmad Faizal Azumu stated in a press conference that Jamaluddin's application to join BERSATU had been rejected as he had taken part in the 2009 Perak constitutional crisis. Jamaluddin had applied to join BERSATU together with the Sungai Manik state assemblyman, Zainol Fadzi Paharudin.


=== As an independent candidate ===
After years of not contesting any election, Jamaluddin attempted to make a comeback by contesting in the 2022 Malaysian general election at the Tanjong Malim federal seat as an independent. He however failed to make a major impression on the election, only garnering 1032 votes and losing his deposit.
