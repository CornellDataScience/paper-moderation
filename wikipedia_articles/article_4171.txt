Inlet is a town in Hamilton County, New York, United States. The population was 355 at the 2020 census, up from 333 in 2010. The name is derived from its location at the eastern end (inlet) of Fourth Lake, part of the Fulton Chain of Lakes.

== History ==
The area developed to serve the needs of many sportsmen after the middle of the 19th century, and was known as the "Inlet on Fourth Lake". The town of Inlet was formed in 1901 from the north part of the town of Morehouse. In 1901, the community of Inlet set itself off as a village by incorporation but has since abandoned that status.


== About the area ==
Inlet has been a hub of Adirondack tourism for more than a century. Inlet is surrounded by over one million acres (400,000 ha) of lands within the Adirondack Park that are easily accessible.
An American Tragedy, Theodore Dreiser's award-winning novel based on the murder of Grace Brown, included a scene at Arrowhead. The actual murder took place in Punkey Bay on Big Moose Lake in 1906. Three days later, Chester Gillette was arrested at the Arrowhead Hotel in Inlet, the site of the present Arrowhead Park. Gillette was sentenced to die in the electric chair in Auburn, New York. The book was later made into the movie "A Place in the Sun" starring Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor.
