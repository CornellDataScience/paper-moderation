The Olympic Tower (German: Olympiaturm) in the Olympic Park, Munich has an overall height of 291 m (955 ft) and a weight of 52,500 tons. At a height of 190 m (620 ft) there is an observation platform as well as an exhibition commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Tower.  Previously in that space was a small rock-and-roll museum housing various memorabilia. Since its opening in 1968, the tower has registered over 43 million visitors (as of 2018). At a height of 182 m (597 ft) there is a revolving restaurant, which seats 230 people. A full revolution takes 53 minutes. The tower also serves as a broadcast tower, and has one Deutsche Telekom maintenance elevator with a speed of 4 m/s (13 ft/s), as well as two visitor lifts with a speed of 7 m/s (23 ft/s) which have a capacity of about 30 people per car. The travel time is about 30 seconds. The tower is open daily from 09:00 to 24:00.
There is a concept of making virtual reality weather timelapse service from Olympiaturm. In case it were implemented, it would become the first tower worldwide with such function.
