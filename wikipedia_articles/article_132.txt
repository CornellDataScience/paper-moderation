== Environmental campaigner ==
Edward Kelly moved from London to an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the Wye Valley in the mid 1980s. During the late 1990s increasing trend towards the use of agricultural polytunnels came to dominate the landscape in some parts of the Wye Valley, and in particular near the artist's residence. He launched the Campaign for Polytunnel Control which seeks that erection of polytunnels should be controlled by planning permission, owing to their massive scale and visual impact. In relation to the campaign Edward Kelly has been interviewed by national press and has appeared in national newspapers and on TV and presented at various government hearings and government reports.
He was portrayed as a character in Pentabus Theatre Company's play "Strawberry Fields" that dealt with the issues associated with migrant workers in industrial scale strawberry farms.
