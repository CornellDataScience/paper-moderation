== History ==
For millennia, the land that is currently Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans.  In 1803, the United States secured most of modern Kansas as part of the Louisiana Purchase.  In 1854, Congress organized the Kansas Territory and in 1861, Kansas became the 34th state.
In 1863, by Act of Congress and similarly by an act of the State of Kansas, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was granted 3,000,000 acres of Kansas land on the condition that it would build a continuous line to the western border of Kansas by March 1, 1873. On Oct. 30, 1868, construction began at Topeka. By Sept. 14, 1870, the first Santa Fe train reached Emporia, fifteen miles past the present site of Reading. James Fagan, agent for the railroad lands, and T. J. Peter and M. S. Sargent, who represented the railroad interest, organized a town company, with James Fagan as president. The land was owned by McMann & Co., of Reading, Pennsylvania.  The town was platted on sixty acres of Section 3, Township 18, Range 13, and called it Reading, after Reading, Pennsylvania.  In summer 1870, the town site was surveyed.
The first post office in Reading was established in August 1870.  Reading was incorporated as a city in September 1890.
