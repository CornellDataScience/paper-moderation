=== Critical response ===
A critic from The Times of India scored the film at 3 out of 5 stars and says "Rangayana Raghu has made a fool of himself by accepting such a stupid role. Music by Jaishivu and cinematography by Shankar are average". A critic from Bangalore Mirror wrote  "The second half gets better, only slightly with the film delving into Arya’s background, his mother and the circumstances that led to his ire against the minister. There is also a strange terrorist group with a Muslim head and Sikh hitman and which targets corrupt politicians. Except for pleasing locales, nothing else in the film makes for a good watch". G S Kumar from Vijaya Karnataka wrote "Arya, though impressive, has to improve his dialogue delivery and expression. Sanjana fails to impress. Rangayana Raghu has made a fool of himself by accepting such a stupid role. Music by Jaishivu and cinematography by Shankar are average".
