== The Ultimate Fighter Latin America 3 Finale: dos Anjos vs. Ferguson ==

The Ultimate Fighter Latin America 3 Finale: dos Anjos vs. Ferguson (also known as UFC Fight Night 98) was a mixed martial arts event held on November 5, 2016, at Arena Ciudad de México in Mexico City, Mexico


=== Background ===
A potential lightweight title eliminator bout between former UFC Lightweight Champion Rafael dos Anjos and The Ultimate Fighter: Team Lesnar vs. Team dos Santos winner Tony Ferguson headlined the event.
The lightweight finale of The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America 3 was contested at the event.
The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen middleweight winner Kelvin Gastelum was expected to face Jorge Masvidal in a welterweight bout at the event. However, on September 14, Gastelum was removed in favor of a replacement bout against former lightweight title challenger Donald Cerrone at UFC 205, one week later. Subsequently, Masvidal was removed from the card entirely rescheduled to face Jake Ellenberger the following month at The Ultimate Fighter: Tournament of Champions Finale.
As a result of the cancellation of UFC Fight Night: Lamas vs. Penn, a bout between Sam Alvey and Alex Nicholson was rescheduled for this event.
Guido Cannetti was expected to face Marco Beltrán in a rematch at the event. The pairing first met at one of The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America's tournament bouts where Beltrán won a controversial decision. However, on October 29, Cannetti was pulled from the bout after USADA revealed a potential anti-doping violation from a sample taken October 15. He was replaced by former Bellator Featherweight Champion and one time UFC Bantamweight Championship challenger Joe Soto and the bout was contested at a catchweight of 140 lb.
At the event's weigh-ins, Charles Oliveira failed to make the featherweight limit for his fight with Ricardo Lamas, coming in nine pounds over the 146 lb weight allowance. He was fined 30 percent of his earnings, and Lamas and promotion officials insisted that Oliveira not weigh more than 160 lb the day of the fight or the fight would be cancelled. Felipe Arantes also missed weight for his bout against Érik Pérez, coming in two pounds over the bantamweight weight allowance. He was fined 20 percent of his purse.

=== Aftermath ===
On August 21, 2017, it was announced that Cannetti was given a 10-month suspension by USADA, retroactive to October 28, 2016. The provisional suspension came after testing positive for ostarine, hydrochlorothiazide and chlorothiazide. USADA conducted tests on the supplements Cannetti was taking at the time of the sample collection, and concluded that the supplements were tainted.
