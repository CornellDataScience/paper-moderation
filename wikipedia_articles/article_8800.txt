This article is the Electoral history of Kim Campbell, the nineteenth Prime Minister of Canada.
A Progressive Conservative, Campbell was the first woman to serve as prime minister.  She served one short term in 1993.  She succeeded Brian Mulroney as prime minister and then led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the general election of 1993.  The Progressive Conservatives were almost wiped out in the election, going from a majority government of 154 seats at dissolution, to two seats and loss of party status in the House of Commons. It was the worst defeat of a federal government in Canadian history.
Campbell lost her own seat and announced her resignation on election night.  Jean Chrétien, leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, succeeded her as prime minister. Jean Charest became leader of the Progressive Conservative party.
Campbell stood for election to the House of Commons twice.  She was elected in the general election of 1988, but defeated in the 1993 election.
Prior to entering federal politics, Campbell had been involved in provincial and municipal politics in her home province of British Columbia.


== Summary ==

Campbell ranks twenty-first out of twenty-three prime ministers for time in office, serving one term of 132 days.  Only Charles Tupper and John Turner had shorter terms in office.
She was the second prime minister from British Columbia, the other being John Turner.
Mulroney announced his retirement early in 1993, triggering a leadership convention in June, 1993.  Campbell won on the second ballot, defeating Jean Charest.
When she succeeded Mulroney as prime minister on June 25, 1993, there were only two months left in the five-year term of the 34th Canadian Parliament, which had been elected in 1988.  Campbell was required to call a general election quickly.  The election was a disaster for the Progressive Conservative party:  they went from a solid majority in the Commons to only two seats.  Under the rules of the House of Commons, the Progressive Conservatives did not have enough seats for official party status.  It was the worst loss for a federal government in Canadian history.
Campbell was defeated in her own seat and announced her resignation.  Jean Charest became the party leader.
Campbell stood for election to the Commons twice:  she won her seat in 1988, and was defeated in 1993.  She served in the Commons for four years, eleven months, and three days.
Prior to entering federal politics, Campbell had been on the Vancouver School Board, and then a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, elected as a member of the Social Credit Party of British Columbia.  In 1986, she entered the leadership race for the Social Credit party, but came in last on the first ballot and was eliminated.
