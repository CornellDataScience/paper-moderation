Mine - A land mine that explodes when stepped on
Bomb - Useless on its own, the bomb is very powerful in combination with the remote detonator or mine
Pitfall - The pitfall halts an opponent's movement by trapping them in a pit for a few seconds, making them vulnerable to attacks
Force panel - The force panel forces your foe in a preset direction; multiple force panels can be used to guide opponents into a mine or trap combination.
Gas - Gas has the largest effect radius of all standalone traps and detonates via timer. Once the gas is set, it is only a matter of time before nerve agent permeates the area, damaging all players with constant health loss, which remains with the player for a few seconds once they escape the vapor cloud.
