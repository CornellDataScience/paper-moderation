Voters chose 20 elected members of the American Samoa House of Representatives. Six incumbent representatives lost their re-election bids.


=== Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives ===
All elections in American Samoa are officially non-partisan, though candidates do identify with a particular political party. Three candidates sought election for Delegate to the U.S. House in 2010.
Incumbent Rep. Eni Faleomavaega, who identifies with the Democratic Party, is seeking re-election. He was re-elected in the 2008 House election with 60% of the vote.
Amata Coleman Radewagen, American Samoa's Republican National Committeewoman who has challenged Faleomavaega in the past, ran again for the seat.
Tuika Tuika, an accountant and former candidate for Governor of American Samoa in the 2008 gubernatorial election, is the third candidate in the election.
In early February 2010, independent Fualaau Rosie Tago Lancaster had announced that she would seek second bid to become American Samoa's delegate to the United States House. Lancaster announced that she will run on a platform promising an emphasis on Veterans issues, better communication and transportation links with the Manu'a Islands, education, healthcare and economic development. Lancaster came in third in the 2008 House election, receiving 5% of the popular vote. However, she did not appear on the general election ballot in November.
Faleomavaega was elected for a twelfth two-year term in office, taking 6,895 ballots, or 56% of the vote.
