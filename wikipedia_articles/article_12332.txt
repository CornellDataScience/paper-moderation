Camden is a city in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the Delaware Valley metropolitan region.  The city was incorporated on February 13, 1828. Camden has been the county seat of Camden County since the county's formation on March 13, 1844. The city derives its name from Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden. Camden is made up of over 20 neighborhoods, and is part of the South Jersey region of the state. 
The initial growth of Camden industrially is often credited to the “big three” employers of Camden: RCA Victor, Campbell's Soup Company and New York Shipbuilding Corporation.  As workers went from disorganized to unionized, labor costs increased locally to a point where the "big three" felt compelled to move away from Camden in the mid-to-late-20th century as they could find cheaper workers elsewhere. Though the city has declined in recent decades since the decline of heavy industry in the area and whiteflight to the suburbs, the city has made efforts to revitalize itself through various infrastructure and community projects.
Projects such as the redevelopment of the waterfront area brought three tourist attractions to the area: the USS New Jersey, the Freedom Mortgage Pavilion and the Adventure Aquarium. The city is the home of Rutgers University–Camden, which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926, and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, which opened in 2012. Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. Camden County College and Rowan University also have campuses in downtown Camden. The "eds and meds" institutions account for roughly 45% of Camden's total employment.
Once known for violent crime, the restructuring of the police force in 2013 has been credited for the decrease in that number. As of January 2021, violent crime was down 46% from its high in the 1990s and at the lowest level since the 1960s. Overall crime reports in 2020 were down 74% compared to 1974, the first year of uniform crime-reporting in the city.


== History ==


=== Prehistory ===
The city traces back to local indigenous Lenape, who are believed to have inhabited this area 13–15,000 years prior to the first European settlers. 


=== Settlement years (1623–1701) ===
Between 1623 and 1627, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May, an officer with the Dutch West India Company and first director of New Netherland, established Fort Nassau, where the Delaware River meets Big Timber Creek, which is today known as Brooklawn. In 1633, David Pietersen De Vries, a Dutch commander, was sailing up the Delaware River when he came across Natives in control of the fort. The settlers that had been left at the fort had decided to return to New Amsterdam (Today Manhattan, New York). Wouter van Twiller, Governor of New Netherland, restored Fort Nassau. He was accused of extravagant spending in the fort's reconstruction. The settlement subsequently sparked competition from European Settlers over control of the fur trade in the area.  The fort was used by the Dutch until around 1650 or 1651 when it was decided that it was far to up the river to be of any value. The buildings and stockades were demolished and Wouter van Twiller assigned Arent Corssen to find a place for another fort. 
The British first had a pressence in the area in 1634. On June 21, 1634, Sir Edmund Ployden was given a charter from King Charles I of England for all territory that lies between New England and Maryland. After the Restoration in 1660, previous claims were largely overwritten, the land around Camden was then controlled by different nobles serving under King Charles II that those associated with Sir Edmund Ployden. 
In 1664, the Duke of York had the King Charles II create the new colony for Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. It was named the Province of New Jersey after George Carteret; in 1649, he was Governor of the Isle of Jersey. Lord John Berkeley kept his share of New Jersey from 1664 until 1674, when he sold it to two Quakers, John Fenwick and Edward Byllynge. This due to political difficulties between him, Carteret, and Governor of New York Richard Nicolls, as well as financial difficulties. Governor Richard Nicolls had objected to the Province of New Jersey as he had exercised control over the area prior under the Province of New York. After Edward Byllynge suffered a bankruptcy and having issues with his creditors, William Penn, one of the creditors, was chosen to be arbitrator. They argued that he funded the purchase of Lord John Berkeley's share of the Province of New Jersey with funds that were justly due to them. It was decided that Fenwick was entitled to 10% of the share, while 90% would be controlled by trustees that are chosen for the benefit of the creditors of Edward Byllynge, who were mostly Quakers themselves. The trustees were chosen to be William Penn, Gawen Laurie and Nicholas Lucas. The goal was to have the trustees sell the territory to colonists so that the creditors of Edward Byllynge would be made whole. It was also hoped that Quaker may be motivated to emigrate to this territory. At the time, the Society of Friends were flirting with the idea of "new country", where they could practice their religious beliefs and not be shamelessly persecuted. In 1676, the Quakers decided to form a colony, spittling the previous colony in two, East Jersey and West Jersey for the Quakers. Quakers settled in the area at the end of the 17th century and the start of the 18th century, drawn by promises of religious freedom, fairer taxation and more representation in government.


=== Colonial (1702–1775) ===
The Quakers expansion, consumption of resources, along with the introduction of alcohol and disease, led to a decline in the Lenape population. The development of a ferry system along the Delaware River bolstered trade between Fort Nassau and Philadelphia. Through ferries, families like Coopers and the Kaighns were able to establish settlements in surrounding areas. In 1773, Jacob Cooper played a significant role in developing the area which is today known as Camden, named after Charles Pratt, the Earl of Camden.


=== Post-colonial (1776–1827) ===
Throughout the Revolutionary War, there were several skrimishes and other effects of the war felt by locals. Development was impeded for the villiage due to the revolution, as Camden was held by the British along with Philadelphia across the Delaware River.


=== Founding and early years (1828–1890) ===
In the 19th century Camden underwent significant changes, transitioning from a hub of transportation to a growing city. Camden was incorporated as a city on February 13, 1828, from portions of Newton Township, while the area was still part of Gloucester County. In 1832, Camden Township was created as a township coextensive with Camden City. The township existed until it was repealed in 1848. Camden Township was established in 1832 which was the same area as Camden City until it was reduced in 1848. In 1830, the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company was chartered in Camden, which connected ferry terminals from New York City to Philadelphia via rail. The railroad ended in Camden's Waterfront, where passengers would be ferried across the Delaware River to arrive in Philadelphia. Similarly to Camden's inception, transportation was a huge catalyst in its growth—the railroads opening in 1834 led to an increase in population and commerce.


=== Industrial growth (1891–1950) ===
At the turn 20th Century, industry grew rapidly at the hands of companies such as the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor), New York Shipbuilding Corporation, and Campbell Soup Company. These were major employers in Camden, at times employing tens of thousands in and outside of Camden. Its location on the Delaware River made it ideal to launch ships.
Camden also experienced dramatic shifts in its population demographic. Immigration from Eastern Europe made them the leading ethnic group by 1920, whereas it had previously been German, British, and Irish immigrants. In 1926, a bridge connected New Jersey and Pennsylvania made its debut opening, which was named the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in 1956. The project cost $37 million, which New Jersey and Pennsylvania both paid equal parts of. The goal was to reduce ferry traffic between Philadelphia and Camden. Camden Central Airport opened in 1929 (closed in 1957).
During the 1930s, Camden faced economic decline in the face of the Great Depression. It was due to Camden's thriving industry that they did not go bankrupt. The United States role in World War II made the New York Shipbuilding Company the largest and most productive ship yard in the world. World War II caused African American migration in and around Camden from the south as there was a need for factory workers for the war effort. Subsequently, Camden became ethnically and religiously segregated. On July 17, 1951, the Delaware River Port Authority, a bi-state agency, was created to promote trade and better coordinate transportation between the two cities of Camden and Phildelphia.


=== Industrial decline (1951–1991) ===
However, by the 1950s, manufacturing came to slow causing industries to relocate and employment to dwindle. In contrast to the growth and industrialization Camden experienced in the early 1900s, there came a drop in population and industry further into the 20th century. Having reached its peak number of manufacturing jobs in 1950, by 1982 it was a quarter of what it had been. Post World War II, Campbell's Soup Company and RCA Victor had decentralized their production efforts in Camden. This Capital Flight was an attempt to avoid an increase in labor wages which unionized workers were fighting for. The New York Shipbuilding Company, a major contributor of naval units during World War II, shut down in 1967 due to low demand and mismanagement.
During this period there was a large amount of white flight, in which white residents moved to surrounding suburbs in search of economic opportunity. Along with this, civil unrest grew resulting in riots. Police brutality and crime were at an all-time high which further exacerbated Camden's problems.


=== Revitalization (1992–present) ===
Efforts to revitalize Camden began in 1980 with Mayor Randy Primas. In an attempt to generate income for the city, he pursued initiatives such as the construction of a riverfront state-prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator which received substantial opposition from residents. With Milton Milan's election as Camden's next mayor, he declared the city bankrupt which resulted in $60 million of aid and the state's assumption of Camden's finances. Another notable revitalization effort was the establishment of non-profit organization, The Parkside Business and Community In Partnership, which occurred in 1993 and is active today.


==== Redevelopment ====

Redevelopment is an idea has loomed over the city since the 1980s, when Mayor Primas started looking for projects to be able to revitalize with the loss of several foundational industries in the preciding decades. In 2013 the New Jersey Economic Development Authority introduced incentives for companies to relocate to Camden. Other projects include the redevelopment of the Waterfront, the construction of the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex, and the Subaru of America's headquarters.


==== 2020s ====
In recent years, Camden has transitioned from a manufacturing industry to an economy focused on education and healthcare. The Eds-and-Meds Industry has become the largest source of employment in Camden—with institutions such as Cooper University Hospital, Rowan University, Rutgers-Camden, Camden County College, Virtua, Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center, and CAMcare.


== Culture ==

Camden's role as an industrial city gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the growth and decline of the city over the course of the 20th century. Camden is also home to historic landmarks detailing its rich history in literature, music, social work and industry such as the Walt Whitman House, the Walt Whitman Cultural Arts Center, the Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts and the Camden Children's Garden. Others include the Camden County Historical Society, which document the city and surrounding area's history. It was built in 1899 as a place for those who find anything that links to one's heritage and for other educational purposes. 
Camden's cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years. From 1950 to 1970, industry plummeted, resulting in close to 20,000 jobs being lost for Camden residents. This mass unemployment as well as social pressure from neighboring townships caused an exodus of citizens, mostly white. This gap was filled by new African American and Latino citizens and led to a restructuring of Camden's communities. The number of White citizens who left to neighboring towns such as Collingswood or Cherry Hill left both new and old African American and Latino citizens to re-shape their community. To help in this process, numerous not-for-profit organizations such as Hopeworks or the Neighborhood Center were formed to facilitate Camden's movement into the 21st century.


=== Community ===

The Black Community has been one of the city's foundations since its founding in 1828 and have contributed heavily to the city's culture. Corinne's Place is a Black-owned soul food restaurant located in Camden, New Jersey. Corinne Bradley-Powers opened the restaurant on Haddon Avenue in 1989. The Hispanic and Latino Community in the city has increased heavily in the past twenty years, but have had a long history in Camden. Puerto Rican Unity for Progress is a multi-service, community-based organization that is located in Camden and serves the Hispanic community who reside in the city. The organization was established in 1976 and opened its physical location at 437 Broadway Street in Camden in June 1978.


=== Arts and entertainment ===

The Arts and Entertainment have always been presence in the city. In the early 20th century, Camden became a hub of music and innovation in entertainment with the presence of the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). It is the birth place of celebrities such as tragic star Russ Columbo; singer and Broadway actress Lola Falana. Today, Camden is home to individuals and groups that help bulster the arts in the city.


=== Religion ===

Camden has religious institutions including many churches and their associated non-profit organizations and community centers such as the Little Rock Baptist Church in the Parkside section of Camden, First Nazarene Baptist Church, 
Kaighn Avenue Baptist Church, and the Parkside United Methodist Church. Other congregations that are active now are Newton Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, on Haddon Avenue and Cooper Street and the Masjid at 1231 Mechanic St, Camden, NJ 08104.
The first Scientology church was incorporated in December 1953 in Camden by L. Ron Hubbard, his wife Mary Sue Hubbard, and John Galusha.

Father Michael Doyle, the pastor of Sacred Heart Catholic Church located in South Camden, has played a large role in Camden's spiritual and social history. In 1971, Doyle was part of the Camden 28, a group of anti-Vietnam War activists who planned to raid a draft board office in the city. This is noted by many as the start of Doyle's activities as a radical 'Catholic Left'. Following these activities, Monsignor Doyle went on to become the pastor of Sacred Heart Church, remaining known for his poetry and activism. Monsignor Doyle and the Sacred Heart Church's main mission is to form a connection between the primarily white suburban surrounding areas and the inner-city of Camden.
In 1982, Father Mark Aita of Holy Name of Camden founded the St. Luke's Catholic Medical Services. Aita, a medical doctor and a member of the Society of Jesus, created the first medical system in Camden that did not use rotating primary care physicians. Since its conception, St. Luke's has grown to include Patient Education Classes as well as home medical services, aiding over seven thousand Camden residents.


=== Philanthropy ===

The city has long had a history of philanthropy and charity, dating back to its founding. The city's founding families were quakers that were very interested in charitable causes like the care of orphans and helping runaway slaves. They were members of the Society of Friends whose members were the likes of William Penn. In 1865, the Society of Friends founded the Camden Home for Friendless Children. Since that home was segregated, the Society of Friends opened the West Jersey Colored Orphanage in 1874.
Camden has a variety of non-profit Tax-Exempt Organizations aimed to assist city residents with a wide range of health and social services free or reduced charge to residents. Camden City, having one of the highest rates of poverty in New Jersey, fueled residents and local organizations to develop organizations aimed to provide relief to its citizens. As of the 2000 Census, Camden's income per capita was $9,815. This ranking made Camden the poorest city in the state of New Jersey, as well as one of the poorest cities in the United States. Camden also has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the nation.

=== Urban enterprise zone ===
Portions of Camden are part of a joint Urban Enterprise Zone. The city was selected in 1983 as one of the initial group of 10 zones chosen to participate in the program. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the 6.625% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in September 1988, the city's Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in December 2023.
The UEZ program in Camden and four other original UEZ cities had been allowed to lapse as of January 1, 2017, after Governor Chris Christie, who called the program an "abject failure", vetoed a compromise bill that would have extended the status for two years. In May 2018, Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that reinstated the program in these five cities and extended the expiration date in other zones.


== Geography and architecture ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 10.34 square miles (26.78 km2), including 8.92 square miles (23.10 km2) of land and 1.42 square miles (3.68 km2) of water (13.75%).
Camden borders Collingswood, Gloucester City, Oaklyn, Pennsauken Township and Woodlynne in Camden County, as well as Philadelphia across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania. Just offshore of Camden is Pettys Island, which is part of Pennsauken Township. The Cooper River (popular for boating) flows through Camden, and Newton Creek forms Camden's southern boundary with Gloucester City.


=== Neighborhoods ===
Camden contains more than 20 generally recognized neighborhoods:


=== Waterfront ===

Historically, the Waterfront has always been a foundational part and major hub of the city. It was home to the New York Shipbuilding Company Shipyards until 1968. Since the 1990s, the Waterfront began a beacon of revitalization for the city. The city's waterfront, along the Delaware River is highlighted by its three main attractions, the USS New Jersey, the Freedom Mortgage Pavilion, and the Adventure Aquarium. The waterfront is also the headquarters for Catapult Learning, the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex, American Water. Camden has two generally recognized neighborhoods located on the Delaware River waterfront, Central and South. Other attractions at the Waterfront are the Wiggins Park Riverstage and Marina, One Port Center, The Victor Lofts, the Walt Whitman House, the Walt Whitman Cultural Arts Center, the Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts, the Camden Children's Garden, Cooper's Poynt Park (former site of Riverfront State Prison).


=== Port ===

On the Delaware River, with access to the Atlantic Ocean, the Port of Camden handles break bulk, bulk cargo, as well as some containers. Terminals fall under the auspices of the South Jersey Port Corporation as well as private operators such as Holt Logistics/Holtec International. The port receives hundreds of ships moving international and domestic cargo annually and is one of the USA's largest shipping centers for wood products, cocoa and perishables.


=== Housing ===
The most common type of home in Camden is rowhouse, similar to those in the neighboring city of Philadelphia. Saint Josephs Carpenter Society (SJCS) is a non profit that has rehabilitated 500 homes throughout the city.
Camden contains the United States' first federally funded planned community for working class residents, Yorkship Village (now called Fairview). The village was designed by Electus Darwin Litchfield, who was influenced by the "garden city" developments popular in England at the time.
In 2013, Cherokee Investment Partners had a plan to redevelop north Camden with 5,000 new homes and a shopping center on 450 acres (1.8 km2). Cherokee dropped their plans in the face of local opposition and the slumping real estate market. They are among several companies receiving New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) tax incentives to relocate jobs in the city.


=== Climate ===
Camden has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the Köppen climate classification) with hot summers and cool to cold winters.


== Education ==


=== Public schools ===

Camden's public schools are operated by the Camden City School District. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in Abbott v. Burke which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of 19 schools, had an enrollment of 7,553 students and 668.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.3:1.
High schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Brimm Medical Arts High School (175; 9–12), 
Camden Big Picture Learning Academy (196; 6–12), 
Camden High School (347; 9–12), 
Creative Arts Academy (290; 6–12), 
Eastside High School (784; 9–12) and 
Pride Academy (63; 6–12).


=== Charter and renaissance schools ===

In 2012, The Urban Hope Act was signed into law, allowing renaissance schools to open in Trenton, Newark, and Camden. The renaissance schools, run by charter companies, differed from charter schools, as they enrolled students based on the surrounding neighborhood, similar to the city school district. This makes renaissance schools a hybrid of charter and public schools. This is the act that allowed Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP), Uncommon Schools, and Mastery Schools to open in the city.
Under the renaissance charter school proposal, the Henry L. Bonsall Family School became Uncommon Schools Camden Prep Mt. Ephraim Campus, East Camden Middle School has become part of Mastery Charter Schools, Francis X. Mc Graw Elementary School and Rafael Cordero Molina Elementary School have become part of the Mastery charter network. The J.G Whittier Family school has become part of the KIPP Public Charter Schools as KIPP Cooper Norcross Academy.
Students were given the option to stay with the school under their transition or seek other alternatives.
In the 2013–14 school year, Camden city proposed a budget of $72 million to allot to charter schools in the city. In previous years, Camden city charter schools have used $52 million and $66 million in the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 school years, respectively.
March 9, 2015, marked the first year of the new Camden Charter Schools open enrollment. Mastery and Uncommon charter schools did not meet enrollment projections for their first year of operation by 15% and 21%, according to Education Law Center.
In October 2016, Governor Chris Christie, Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd, Camden Public Schools Superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard, and state and local representatives announced a historical $133 million investment of a new Camden High School Project. The new school is planned to be ready for student occupancy in 2021. It would have 9th and 12th grade.
As of 2019, there are 3,850 Camden students enrolled in one of the city's renaissance schools, with 4,350 Camden students are enrolled one of the city's charter schools. Combined, these students make up approximately 55% of the 15,000 students in Camden.

=== Libraries ===
The city was once home to two Carnegie libraries, the Main Building and the Cooper Library in Johnson Park. The city's once extensive library system, beleaguered by financial difficulties, threatened to close at the end of 2010, but was incorporated into the county system. The main branch closed in February 2011, and was later reopened by the county in the bottom floor of the Paul Robeson Library at Rutgers University.
Camden also has three academic libraries; The Paul Robeson Library at Rutgers University-Camden serves Rutgers undergraduate and graduate students, as well as students from the Camden campuses of Camden County College and Rowan University. Rutgers Law School has a law library and Cooper Medical School at Rowan has a medical library.


== Sports ==


=== Camden Athletic Complex ===
The Camden Athletic Complex (former site of Campbell's Field) which was completed in 2022. it contains a baseball field, track and field area, soccer field, and lacrosse field. The Camden Riversharks were an American professional baseball team based in Camden, which played out of the former Campbell's Field. An investment totaling $15 million, planned to be split evenly between Rutgers and the city of Camden, will reportedly develop the area into a recreational complex for the city, as well as accommodations for the university's NCAA Division III sports teams.


=== Philadelphia 76ers training facility ===

The team found a property at the Camden Waterfront. An $82 million grant was approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to begin construction of the training facility in Camden, and was scheduled to break ground in October 2014. The grant was somewhat controversial in that it saves the 76ers organization from paying any property taxes or fees that would be accrued by the building over its first decade. Vocal opponents of the facility claim that the site has now joined a list of large companies or industries that are invited to Camden with significant monetary incentive, at great expense to local tax payers as a form of corporate welfare. Based on contingent hiring, the grant was to be paid out over 10 years, with the facility scheduled to host practices by 2016. The training facilities include the two full-size courts, as well as a weight room, full hydrotherapy room, Gatorade Fuel Bar, full players-only restaurant and personal chef, medical facilities, film room, and full locker room.


== Government and services ==

Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party. Since July 1, 1961, the city has operated within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under a Mayor-Council form of government. Since 1994, the city has been divided into four council districts, with a single council member elected from each of the four districts and three council members being elected at-large; previously, the entire council was elected at-large.
As of 2024, the Mayor of Camden is Democrat Victor Carstarphen, whose term of office ends December 31, 2025. Members of the City Council are Council President Angel Fuentes (D, 2025; at large), Vice President Sheila Davis (D, 2025; at large), Arthur Barclay (D, 2027; Ward 1), Christopher R. Collins (D, 2027; Ward 2), Falio Leyba-Martinez (D, 2027; Ward 3), Jannette Ramos (D, 2027; Ward 4) and Noemi G. Soria-Perez (D, 2025; at large).
It was home to the Norcross brothers, three brothers who have dominated Southern Jersey democratic politics for the past 25 years, until legal troubles in 2024 led them to take a backseat. The city has had its struggles with corruption throughout its political history. Three Camden mayors have been jailed for corruption: Angelo Errichetti, Arnold Webster, and Milton Milan.


=== Federal, state and county representation ===
Camden is located in New Jersey's 1st Congressional District and is part of New Jersey's 5th state legislative district.
New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027) and George Helmy (Mountain Lakes, term ends 2024).
Camden County is governed by a Board of County Commissioners composed of seven members chosen at-large in partisan elections for three-year terms on a staggered basis by the residents of the county, with either two or three seats up for election each year as part of the November general election. At a reorganization meeting held in January after each election, the newly constituted Board of Commissioners selects one member to serve as Director and another as Deputy Director, each serving a one-year term in that role.

=== Camden Fire Department (CFD) ===

Officially organized in 1869, the Camden Fire Department (CFD) is the oldest paid fire department in New Jersey and is among the oldest paid fire departments in the United States. The Camden Fire Department currently operates out of five fire stations, organized into two battalions. Each battalion is commanded by a battalion chief, who in turn reports to a deputy chief. The CFD currently operates five engine companies, one squad (rescue-pumper), three ladder companies, and one rescue company, as well as several other special, support, and reserve units. The department's fireboat is docked on the Delaware River. Since 2010, the Camden Fire Department has suffered severe economic cutbacks, including company closures and staffing cuts. 


=== Camden County Police Department (CCPD) ===

On May 1, 2013, Camden Police Department was disbanded due to a union contract that made it financially impossible to keep officers on the street. The Camden County Police Department was formed to succeed the Camden Police Department. Camden County's Police Department brought in 25 new officers to train in neighborhoods in hopes they could regain the trust of local communities. Because of the reorganized force in 2013, the number of cops in the streets has increased, and spread throughout Camden. Camden's new police force began patrolling in tandem, speaking with residents, and driving patrol cars. A CNN report proposed that Camden might be a national model for what police abolition or "defunding the police" could look like.


==== Crime ====
Camden once had a national reputation for its violent crime rates, when there were a record 67 homicides in the city. On October 29, 2012, the FBI announced Camden was ranked first in violent crime per capita of cities with over 50,000 residents. Recent years have seen a significant drop in violent crime, with 2017 seeing the lowest number of homicides in three decades, 23 murders, half as many as the 44 murders the previous year. Morgan Quitno has ranked Camden as one of the top ten most dangerous cities in the United States since 1998, when they first included cities with populations less than 100,000. In 2018, the Camden County Police Department reported that violent crime had dropped 18%, led by a 21% decline in aggravated assaults; overall nonviolent crimes fell by 12%, the number of arson incidents fell by 29%, burglaries by 21%, and non-fatal "shooting hit incidents" had dropped by 15%. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, there were 22, 24, and 23 homicides respectively. In 2021, the city saw 23 homicides and a further reduction in violent crime, contrasting national trends. Total violent crime in the city declined in 2022, despite 28 murders and a spike of 29% in non-violent crime, highlighted by a sharp increase in car-related crime.


== Transportation ==


=== Public transportation ===
The Walter Rand Transportation Center opened May 17, 1989 under the name of Camden Transportation Center and was later named after a former New Jersey State senator, Walter Rand in 1994. The surface level bus transfer center located on the corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Broadway, includes both indoor and outdoor stations and runs between the hours of 6am and 9:30pm, seven days a week. A majority of buses that stop at the center are NJ Transit buses that provide inexpensive and quick transportation to Philadelphia, Camden and Burlington Counties surrounding cities. The different routes include 313, 315, 316, 317, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 412, 413, 418, 419, 450, 451, 452, 453, 457 and 551. Depending on distance and route the bus fare varies from under a dollar for closer stops, up to fifty dollars for farther stations including Philadelphia and Atlantic City. Along with the NJ Transit buses, the center is also home to many Greyhound Lines, that provide transportation to neighboring cities as well as to much farther destinations all around the country. Like the NJ Transit buses, the Greyhound bus fares vary from inexpensive for closer destinations and much more expensive for the farther the destination. Along with the bus stops, the center is home to two rail road system stations, the Walter Rand River Line station and PATCO, Broadway station which provides easy access to the busses from the surrounding area.
Since its opening on March 14, 2004, NJ Transit's River Line has offered light rail service to cities along the Delaware River starting in North Camden, and terminating in Trenton. There are four total stations located in the city, the southern most station is located at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion located on the Delaware River, and goes north along the river up to Trenton. The second and third most south stations in Camden stop at the Camden Adventure Aquarium and at Rutgers University. The last stop in the city, the Walter Rand Transportation Center, located on Martin Luther King Boulevard and Broadway, is a major transportation hub where the PATCO, NJ Transit buses, and Greyhounds all meet. Since its opening the River Line was running 24-hours a day, but switched in 2010 to no service after 10pm. Fares are priced at $1.70 and are stamped by an employee when boarding the train and fare evasion carries a fine of up to $100. Along with physical tickets that can be purchased at each station, online tickets can be purchased through smart phones on the NJ Transit App. The River Line was the first railroad to use a diesel LRV vehicle. Using diesel LRV vehicles made it cheaper to run and much easier to start and stop because of the frequent stations and cross roads that the rail stops for. Since the start of this type of transit multiple other cities have started to use it as well, including Austin, Texas.
The PATCO Speedline offers frequent train service to Philadelphia and the suburbs to the east in Camden County, including Camden, Collingswood, Haddon Township, Haddonfield, Cherry Hill, Voorhees, and Lindenwold. Throughout the two states there are a total of 13 stations. Unlike most major US transit systems, the PACTO Speedline is running 24-hours a day. Opening in 1926 under the name of The Delaware River Bridge Commission, the rail consisted of 6 Philadelphia stops, and only two Camden stops, City Hall, and Broadway station. In 1951 Pennsylvania and New Jersey signed a contract allowing the expansion of the railroad. These expansions included station between Camden and Lindenwold. Unlike the River Line the PATCO uses automated fare collection. The first station after crossing the river into Philadelphia, Franklin Square closed in 1979 because of the low number of riders. The station was proposed for a remodel and is planned on opening during the summer of 2024. From 1969 to 2006 the system used plastic tickets which had an oxide layer on the entire back side used for magnetic encoding. Starting in 2006 the use of contactless paper tickets with a much smaller magnetic strip made the production and storage of tickets much cheaper and wasteful. Along with the paper tickets frequent rides could buy a plastic reusable card that could be refilled and also provide discounts on both fairs and specifics store near each station. Stations outside of the cities including Ferry ave, Collingswood, Vestment, Haddonfield, Woodcrest, Ashland, and Lindenwold, provide free day time parking and one dollar overnight parking, while the stations in the cities do not have access to parking.
The RiverLink Ferry opened March 1992, as a passenger ferry service that crossed the Delaware River connecting the Camden Water Front with Philadelphia's, Penn's Landing. The ferry operates daily from May through September, and on Fridays through Sundays in April and October. Docking at Wiggins Park, located between the Adventure Aquarium and the Battleship New Jersey, the ferry provides access to the Adventure Aquarium, Battleship New Jersey, Camden's Children's Garden, and the Freedom Mortgage Pavilion. On the Philadelphia side of the river the ferry docks at the Independence Seaport Museum, and provides access to the many attractions located at Penns Landing, including multiple city piers, and restaurants as well as Museums, the battle ship Olympia, and the submarine Becuna. Penn's Landing open up up the opportunity to exploring the historical section of Center City Philadelphia including Independence Hall, and City Hall. Round trip ticket prices range from $8 for children and seniors to $10 for adults while children under the age of four ride for free.
The RiverLink Ferry was not the first ferry to call Camden home. Since the start of the United States there has been a need to transport goods and people across the Delaware. Before the construction of the Ben Franklin Bridge there were multiple ferries that launched from Camdens waterfront including on Market street, and Vine street located in the downtown area, as well as Kaighn ave located in South Camden. During the winter when the river had frozen horse were used to tow the ferries across like sleds, which helped slow the number of injuries and death that occurred from individuals that walked across the ice. On one occasion the fire started aboard one of the ferries. On March 15, 1856, the Delaware was full of floating chucks of ice rushing through the ruff current when flames burst out along the upper deck. People on board did their best to calm the fire with buckets of freezing water but resorted to jumping over board. As a result, over sixty people died in the accident with countless missing while only 30 made it out alive. Between the years of 1727 and 1766 more than 800 slaves were brought by 3 different ferries and sold in Downtown, Camden. Today there are historical signs placed at these three sites to commemorate the people sold there.

Interstate 676 and U.S. Route 30 run through Camden to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge on the north side of the city. Interstate 76 passes through briefly and interchanges with Interstate 676.
Route 168 passes through briefly in the south and County Routes 537, 543, 551 and 561 all travel through the center of the city.


== Environmental problems ==

Over the past few decades, Camden has faced many environmental problems due to its history of heavy industry and the improper disposal of contaminents. Environmental concerns include air/water pollution and soil contamination. There are several Superfund sites throughout the city. In recent years, illegal dumping has become a issue due to the large number of vacant lots throughout the city and a lack of security and maintenance.
