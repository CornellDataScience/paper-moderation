The Russian American Medical Association (RAMA) is a non-profit organization of Russian American physicians founded in 2002 with a mission to facilitate and enable Russian American physicians and health care professionals to excel in patient care, teaching and research, and to pursue their aspirations in professional, humanitarian and community affairs. RAMA is partnering with a number of professional organizations, including such key collaborators as Russian American Dental Association, Russian American Scientists Association (RASA) and American Business Association of Russian Professionals (AmBAR). This and other partnerships foster collaboration among doctors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and medical researchers of European, American and Asian descent in the areas of medical education, biomedical and clinical research, as well as innovation and improvement of health care.
RAMA is not a political organization but does participate in legislative and political processes.  RAMA works through regional representatives and chapters, which aim to be independent in their activity and decision-making. Each chapter's President or representative becomes a member of the Board of Directors and helps coordinate the association's work. It holds regular annual meetings, often in conjunction with other groups, such as Russian-American Dental Association (RADA) and publishes a journal.
RAMA is the largest association of Russian professionals outside of Russia, irrespective of the specialty. There are 66 full members from 40 states of the United States, and Canada, Russia, other CIS countries, England, Germany, Israel, Estonia and South Africa. The database of the Association includes more than 800 Russian-speaking physicians and other medical professionals.
RAMA was founded in 2002 by Dr. Boris Vinogradsky (now from Cleveland, Ohio, USA) as a coalition of several independent groups of doctors and now has organized chapters in Massachusetts, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota, Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, the Student Chapter and the Canada Group. It is working with groups of physicians in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, St. Paul, San Francisco and Los Angeles to form new chapters.
Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, hundreds of thousands of Russian physicians, biomedical scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs have succeeded in building their professional careers, their personal lives and lives of their families around the world.  A palpable part of this community is interested in helping the Russian people to improve health and life expectancy by building modern healthcare, institutions of biomedical research and entrepreneurship, and by joining international biomedical community via numerous professional organizations and institutions.  The Russian American Medical Association plans to establish RAMA Institute of Medicine, which aims to further integrate Russian American medical specialists and biomedical scientists and researchers into the global biomedical community.
