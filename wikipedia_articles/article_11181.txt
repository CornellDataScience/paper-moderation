== Personal life and sexual assault allegations ==
Nash died at the age of 88 on July 3, 2021, in Medford, New Jersey.
In 2023, the documentary filmmaker Jennifer Fox said that Nash had sexually abused her when she was 13 and he was 40. Nash was Fox's running instructor in 1973 when she was at horseback riding summer camp. Fox alleges that Nash forced her to perform oral sex multiple times. Fox also disclosed that in high school she wrote an essay detailing the abuse. She had previously told the story of her abuse, without revealing Nash's identity, in the 2018 film The Tale.
Nash's first wife Aldina Nash-Hampe described the accusation as a "surprise", but conceded that Nash "seemed to have affairs with a lot of women" and in 1972 she filed for a divorce after she found letters from Nash to other women. Jan Nash, his second wife, and Sean P. Colgan, one of Nash's former collegiate and national team rowers, described the accusations as uncharacteristic.
USRowing initiated an investigation into Ted Nash after being contacted by Jennifer Fox in 2022. The investigation was conducted by the law firm of Shearman & Sterling over a 16 month period. On April 30, 2024, USRowing released the investigation's 154 page report. In their statement, USRowing said, "Having reviewed the investigation's findings, USRowing believes there is compelling evidence supporting Ms. Fox's allegations of child sex abuse by Mr. Nash... In response to the findings of the investigation, we are rescinding all honors USRowing previously conferred upon Mr. Nash...  Furthermore, we encourage all other organizations affiliated with Mr. Nash, and who may have granted him similar honors, to review the full report."
