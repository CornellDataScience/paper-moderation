Antonio Masip Hidalgo (born May 3, 1946, in Oviedo) is a Spanish politician, lawyer and a Member of the European Parliament for the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, part of the Socialist Group. He sits on the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs.
He is also a substitute for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, a member of the Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council and a substitute for the Delegation for relations with the countries of the Andean Community.
He was mayor of his hometown from 1983 to 1991, and regional congressman in Asturias from 1983 to 1987. Masip was first involved in Spanish politics during Franco's Spanish State (being a member of the opposition Frente de Liberación Popular—"Felipe"), and then being a member of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party since 1979.
He was one of the first lawyers in Asturias to defend workers outside the Francoist vertical trade unions in the early 1970s.
