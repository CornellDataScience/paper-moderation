This is a list of wrestlers who have won the sumo second division jūryō championship since 1909, when the current championship system was established. These official tournaments are held exclusively in Japan.
The wrestler who has won the most jūryō championships is Masurao, with five.  Wakanami, Tagaryū, Ichinojō, Terunofuji and Asanoyama are the only wrestlers to have won a jūryō championship after winning a top division or makuuchi title. The only wrestlers to win the jūryō championship but never earn promotion to the top division are Genbuyama (1927), Sagahikari (1957), Tochiizumi (1983), Hidenohana (1988), Daigaku (1991), Hakuyozan (2021) and Tochimusashi (2022).


== 1958 to present ==
The first table below lists the champions since the six tournament system instituted in 1958. The championship is determined by the wrestler with the highest win–loss score after fifteen bouts, held at a rate of one per day over the duration of the 15-day tournament. In the event of a tie a play-off is held between the wrestlers concerned.
Names in bold mark an undefeated victory (a zenshō-yūshō). Figures in brackets mark the number of championships earned up to that tournament for wrestlers who won the championship more than once.
