Hansen Motorsport (officially Kenneth Hansen Motorsport AB), which formerly competed under the title Team Peugeot-Hansen as Peugeot's official partner in the motorsport of rallycross, is a team founded by Swedish racing driver Kenneth Hansen in 1990.
The team has been competing in the FIA World Rallycross Championship since its creation in 2014. Hansen Motorsport used Citroën cars exclusively from 1993 and switched to Peugeot in 2014. Hansen Motorsport ran Peugeot's entry in the World Rallycross Championship from 2014 to 2017.
In December 2017, it was announced that Peugeot Sport would take over the running of Peugeot's factory cars from Hansen Motorsport, through Team Peugeot Total. Kenneth Hansen stayed on as sporting director with Team Peugeot Total.
Hansen Motorsport has won more top-level rallycross championships than any other team, with four World Championship titles, 19 European Championship titles, two Nitro Rallycross titles and two X Games gold medals. In addition to Hansen World RX Team, which competes in World RX, the team also supports the development of young drivers through its junior programme, #YellowSquad.


== Current drivers ==

Kenneth Timmy Hansen (born 21 May 1992) is a rallycross driver from Sweden. He won the 2019 FIA World Rallycross Championship, driving for Team Peugeot-Hansen. His father is the 14-times European Rallycross Champion Kenneth Hansen, his mother the 1994 ERA European Cup (Group N up to 1400cc) winner Susann Hansen (née Bergvall), and his brother rallycross driver Kevin Hansen.
Timmy initially sought a different path, climbing the single-seater after becoming Swedish karting champion in 2008. In Formula BMW Europe, he raced against the likes of future Formula 1 drivers Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat, winning races there and in Formula Renault 2.0.
By 2013, Timmy had made the full-time switch to rallycross, finishing third in the European Rallycross Championship that year, and has competed in World RX since the championship's inaugural season in 2014.
Mikael Kevin Hansen (born 28 May 1998) is a rallycross driver from Sweden. He currently competes in the FIA World Rallycross Championship(WRX) Supercar category for Team Peugeot-Hansen. He is also currently competing in Extreme E for Veloce Racing alongside Molly Taylor. 
His father is the 14-time European Rallycross Champion Kenneth Hansen. He is also the youngest driver to race in a WRX event, making his debut at 17 years and 6 months old.
Kevin had already become the youngest FIA European Rallycross Champion, taking the title on debut in 2016 driving a Supercar. Winning four races out of five that season led to his FIA Rookie of the Year award, joining the likes of Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc in winning the accolade.
Competing in 48 rounds since his World RX debut in late 2015, Kevin's 2023 campaign was the most successful to date, finishing second in the championship race with an event win at the inaugural World RX of Hong Kong, China.
