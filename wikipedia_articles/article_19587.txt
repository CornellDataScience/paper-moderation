== Background ==
Aesop Rock announced the album on September 14, 2023, and released a music video for "Mindful Solutionism", the lead single of the album. On October 5, Aesop released "By the River", the second single of the album, and three weeks later, he released "Infinity Fill Goose Down", the third single for the album.


== Music ==
Integrated Tech Solutions has been characterized as a "loose concept album" that explores technology and consumerism. It also features narratives inspired by Aesop's own life experiences, leading the album's prevailing mood to be described as "reflective".
Lead single "Mindful Solutionism" discusses the history of technological advancement, including its harms. Conversely, the album's second single – "By the River" – features "soft percussion and a jazzy horn" and explores Aesop's appreciation of rivers and his memories of deceased friend Camu Tao. "Living Curfew", in which Aesop and featured artist Billy Woods describe the feel of cities at different times of day, includes production that has been likened to trip hop. "Aggressive Steven" tells the story of Aesop's encounter with a home invader and reflects on society's treatment of mental illness; other storytelling tracks are more lighthearted, such as "100 Feet Tall", in which Aesop recounts a childhood experience meeting Mr. T at a restaurant. "On Failure" is a spoken word track in which Aesop considers the life and legacy of Vincent van Gogh.


== Critical reception ==

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Integrated Tech Solutions received an average score of 84 based on 7 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".
Aesop's writing on the album received particular praise, with Paul Simpson of AllMusic characterizing him as "a master of telling playfully outlandish tales". Stephen Kearse of Pitchfork was similarly approving, noting that "elite technique is clearly second nature for [Aesop] at this point" and describing Integrated Tech Solutions as containing "some of his most fully realized songs". Comparing this record to Aesop's earlier work, reviewers have described him as adopting a "more conversational than combative" delivery, as well as "rein[ing] in his tendencies toward word salad". Critics also praised the detailed storytelling that occurs throughout the record.
The production on Integrated Tech Solutions also achieved acclaim. Kitty Empire of The Observer described Aesop's beats on the album as "bouncy retro production that crackles with vim", and Kearse described it as "accomplished and purposeful" work that "emphasize[s] rhythm as much as texture". Reviewers identified the major elements of the production as including "funky boom-bap with touches of psych-rock guitar", as well as "bubbling synthesizers and turntable scratches".
