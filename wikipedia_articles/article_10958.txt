=== Trial of Hamid ===
The conflict between Sitepu and Hamid lasted long after the election. Sitepu accused Hamid of corruption, and the communist masses — the main support base for Sitepu — demanded Hamid to be tried at the court. The chairman of the Medan District Court, Marthias, rejected the accusation, citing the lack of evidence.
According to Effendi Nasution, a staunch anti-communist, the communist masses launched another demonstration, demanding Marthias to be fired from his office and Hamid to be hanged. Marthias was later replaced by Palti Raja Siregar, who tried Hamid and sentenced him to 12 years in prison. Hamid appealed his case, and in 1966, his sentence was reduced to 7 years.
Raja Maimunah, the wife of Hamid, recalled that during the trial of Hamid, the communist masses threatened to destroy Hamid's house and the district court building if Munir was not sentenced. Maimunah also stated that Hamid's house was regularly guarded by soldiers due to this threat.
An investigative team formed by the efforts of Hamid supporters began looking into the accusations. The team concluded that there was no corruption conducted by Hamid in the companies. Following the publication of the conclusions, Hamid appealed a review of his case to the Supreme Court of Indonesia in 1967, but his appeal was rejected. He appealed his case again on 16 March 1982, and the Supreme Court instructed the Medan District Court to investigate the issue on 13 August 1983. The district court stated that it could not investigate the issue due to the loss of documents relating to the case.
