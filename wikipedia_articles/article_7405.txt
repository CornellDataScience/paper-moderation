Club Deportivo Walter Ormeño (sometimes referred as Walter Ormeño de Cañete) is a Peruvian football club, playing in the city of Cañete, Lima, Peru.


== History ==
The Club Deportivo Walter Ormeño was founded on October 10, 1950. It was named Club Walter Ormeño, in honor of Walter Ormeño, who was the goalkeeper from Universitario de Deportes; most of the founders were supporters of the team. The Club Deportivo Walter Ormeno originally played in the San Vicente District League in the beginning but it moved to the Imperial District League where it would see much of its early success. The team won the 1970 Lima Department League.
In 1974, The Peruvian Football Federation promoted all eight regional Copa Peru champions to the 1974 Torneo Descentralizado. That year was the first and last year in which the club participated in the highest level of Peruvian soccer league. It was relegated to a new relegation system which it eliminated the worst team in the league, the worst from the Metropolitan Lima area team, and the worst two teams from the Peruvian departments that had more than two teams in the league. This meant that Walter Ormeño, Piérola, and Juan Aurich played an extra group stage to decide who could stay in the league where the team did not succeed. Years later it was invited to play in the Peruvian Segunda Division where it was runner-up behind Hijos de Yurimaguas in 1990 only to be relegated in 1991. In 2013, after reaching the round of 16 of the 2012 Copa Peru it was invited to play the Peruvian Segunda Division once more.
