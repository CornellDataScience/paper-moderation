Xiao Chuo, nickname Yanyan (Chinese: 蕭燕燕; 953 – 29 December 1009), also known as Empress Dowager Chengtian (承天皇太后) was a Khitan empress and military leader of imperial China's Liao dynasty. She was regent on behalf of her son from 982.


== History ==
Xiao Yanyan was the 3rd child of Xiao Siwen (蕭思溫), Liao's chancellor. Also referred to by the name Xiao Chuo, Xiao's original Khitan family name was Bali (拔裏氏).  She was the youngest of the Xiao sisters, along with Xiao Hunian and Lady Xiao.
Xiao later married Emperor Jingzong of Liao and would go on to bear the crown Prince Yelü Longxu. Being granted the title of Empress, Xiao was influential during her husband's reign.
She would go on to become regent for her son in 982 when he ascended the Liao throne as Emperor Shengzong at 12 years old after the untimely death of Emperor Jingzong of Liao who died while returning from a hunting trip. 
In Khitan culture, it was acceptable for women to take part in military action, and indeed to be military commanders: Xiao became a military commander of great renown. In 986, the Liao Empire was invaded by the Song dynasty to the south under the leadership of Emperor Taizong of Song, but was defeated by Liao forces under Xiao's command; she is said to have commanded the troops herself on the front line of the battle. They routed the Song soldiers and captured thousands, who, as it was her birthday, Xiao pardoned. A further invasion by the Song would ensue in 989 only to be defeated once again by Liao forces resulting in the death of Yang Ye.
In her personal life, Empress Dowager Chengtian was reported to have an accepted, spouse-like relationship with her advisor - and commanded of the Northern Chancellery - Han Derang.
As Empress Dowager Chengtian, Xiao commanded her own army of 10,000 cavalry and would personally lead the Liao army in battle against the Song in 1005, despite being over 50 years old by that point. 
Known for her great skills in civil administration, Empress Dowager Chengtian retained great influence until her death at age 57 in 1009. Chinese chronicles, such as The History of the Liao, credit most of the success of Emperor Shengzong's reign to his mother, Chengtian.
She was also instrumental in arranging a marriage between her son and her court lady, Xiao Noujin. However, she had a poor relationship with her two older sisters, and she eventually poisoned or murdered both of them.
