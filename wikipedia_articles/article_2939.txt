Robert Anthony Altemeyer (6 June 1940 â€“ 7 February 2024) was a Canadian psychologist who was Professor of Psychology at the University of Manitoba. Altemeyer also produced the right-wing authoritarianism scale, or RWA Scale, as well as the related left-wing authoritarianism scale, or LWA Scale.
Altemeyer first defined the right-wing authoritarian personality in 1981, as a refinement of the authoritarian personality theory originally pioneered by University of California, Berkeley researchers Theodor W. Adorno, Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel Levinson, and Nevitt Sanford. Altemeyer defined the right-wing authoritarian personality as someone who: 

is naturally submissive to authority figures that they consider to be legitimate,
acts aggressively in the name of said authority figures, and/or
is very conventional (i.e. conformist) in thought and behavior.
Altemeyer performed extensive research on authoritarianism, identifying the psychological makeup of authoritarian followers, and authoritarian leaders. His studies concentrated on who the followers are, how they got that way, how they think, and why they tend to be submissive and aggressive. He also collected data on authoritarianism among North American politicians.
Altemeyer documented his research in several books, most recently for general audiences in The Authoritarians,  written at the suggestion of John W. Dean. Altemeyer's work is referenced in Dean's 2006 book, Conservatives Without Conscience. Altemeyer's last book, Authoritarian Nightmare, co-written by Dean, is a book about U.S. President Donald Trump and his authoritarian followers.
