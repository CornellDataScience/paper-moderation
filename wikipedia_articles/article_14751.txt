== Solutions ==
This equation can be cast into the form of the hypergeometric differential equation.  It has two linearly independent solutions, called the periods of elliptic functions.  The ratio of the two periods is equal to the period ratio τ, the standard coordinate on the upper-half plane. However, the ratio of two solutions of the hypergeometric equation is also known as a Schwarz triangle map.
The Picard–Fuchs equation can be cast into the form of Riemann's differential equation, and thus solutions can be directly read off in terms of Riemann P-functions. One has

At least four methods to find the j-function inverse can be given.
Dedekind defines the j-function by its Schwarz derivative in his letter to Borchardt.   As a partial fraction, it reveals the geometry of the fundamental domain:
