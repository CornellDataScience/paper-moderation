Raúl Anton Rial (October 12, 1936 – 2001) was a Uruguayan painter and engraver.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Montevideo, Uruguay, on October 12, 1936, Rial displayed an early talent for visual arts. He studied at the National School of Fine Arts in Montevideo, where the teachings of Joaquín Torres García deeply influenced him. This foundational education helped Rial develop a modernist style while retaining a distinctly Uruguayan identity.

== Artistic themes and style ==
Rial's works covered a diverse array of themes:

Maritime Themes: Paintings of seascapes, ships, and ports reflected Uruguay's coastal culture.
Musicians: Portraits and depictions of orchestra performers.
Abstract and Everyday Life: Still lifes and scenes from daily Uruguayan life often combined abstraction with representational art.
His works are characterized by a modernist approach, blending abstraction and emotional resonance."Our lives were intertwined; he played the drums as a hobby, while I improvised with a pair of brushes. From that fusion of two arts came the most original aspect of Raúl Rial's work. He was the only painter I know who devoted himself to portraying the world of musicians. Perhaps someone might tell me that Degas had already done this, but the difference is that in the works of the excellent French painter, ballerinas are the protagonists, while in Raúl's paintings, the musicians take center stage."
— Federico García Vigil, 2002
