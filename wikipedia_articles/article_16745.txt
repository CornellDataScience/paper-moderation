== History ==
John Keells Holdings diversified into the tourism industry with the acquisition of Walkers Tours in 1972. Walkers Tours established its first hotel in Habarana in 1973. John Keells' hotel management company operated under several names throughout its history. In the 1970s, the company was known as Walkers Tours Hotels, and in the 1980s as Hotel Management & Marketing Services Limited and finally, in the 1990s, it came to be known as John Keells Hotels. By 1981, the company was managing seven resorts. Four were beach resorts on the Southern Coast, viz. Beach Hotel Bayroo (present-day Cinnamon Bey Beruwala), Swanee Hotel, Beruwala, Ceysands Hotel, Bentota, and Ambalangoda Rest House. The three resorts in the countryside were Habarana Lodge, Habarana Village and Kandy Walk Inn, which was under construction and later became Cinnamon Citadel Kandy. John Keells acquired Whittall Boustead and gained control of Bentota Beach Hotel and Coral Gardens Hotel (Present-day Hikka Tranz by Cinnamon). In 1993, John Keells owned and managed 900 rooms which accounted for 16% of the room capacity of resorts located outside Colombo. John Keells ventured into the Maldives market in 1996 with the acquisition of the 80-roomed Velidhu Resort Hotel.

All resorts, including listed resorts and Maldivian resorts brought under one holding company, Keells Hotels Limited, with the intention of being listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. The shares of the four listed companies were brought up by Keells Hotels. John Keells Hotels listed on 17 September 2004. Beach Hotel Beruwala, Coral Gardens Hotel and Club Oceanic Trincomalee were damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Hakuraa Resort in Maldives was also damaged, and it predicted the resort would take six months to reopen. The Bentota Beach Hotel recommenced operations within ten days of the disaster.
John Keells Hotels introduced the "Chaaya Hotels & Resorts" brand in 2007 ITB Berlin. Habarana Village became the first resort launched under the Chaaya brand after refurbishment.
