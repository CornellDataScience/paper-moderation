Sir George William Abercromby of Birkenbog, 8th Baronet DSO (18 March 1886 â€“ 9 September 1964) was a Scottish baronet and landowner, who served as Lord Lieutenant of Banffshire between 1946 and 1964.

The Abercromby baronets descend from Humphrey Abercromby of Pitmedden (died circa 1457) and the title was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 20 February 1636. Abercromby was born in 1886, the elder son of Sir Robert Abercromby, 7th Baronet and his wife Florence, daughter of Eyre Coote. His father died in 1895 at which time he succeeded to the baronetcy, aged only nine. His mother subsequently married in 1899, Francis Baring, 2nd Earl of Northbrook. Abercromby was educated at Eton College. His extensive estate was situated principally around the town of Turriff with the family seat being Forglen House, a property which had been inherited by the Abercromby family from William Ogilvy, 8th Lord Banff.
