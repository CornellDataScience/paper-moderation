Zwölf Stücke, Op. 80, is a group of twelve pieces for organ by Max Reger. He composed them in Munich in 1902 and 1904. They were published by C. F. Peters in Leipzig in September 1904.


== History and movements ==
The pieces are character pieces of medium difficulty, as a contrast to his major organ works. Reger had written such works already as a student in Wiesbaden. He turned to the organ in Weiden. On a request of the publisher Henri Hinrichsen of C. F. Peters, Reger composed 15 pieces in Munich in 1902. Peters published twelve in Leipzig in August 1902 as Zwölf Stücke, Op. 65. Reger used the three still unpublished pieces (Fughette, Gigue, Intermezzo) and composed additional nine pieces in 1904, to form a similar set of works that can be played in sequence or individually. In Reger's lifetime, performers often combined movements from different collections.
The twelve pieces were published by C. F. Peters in Leipzig in September 1904, in two books (Heft) of six pieces each. Reger dedicated the pieces of Heft 1 to Franz Grunicke, an organist in Berlin, and those of Heft 2 to Otto Burkert.
The titles and keys are:

Präludium, E minor
Fughette, E minor
Canzonetta, G minor
Gigue, D minor
Ave Maria, D-flat major
Intermezzo, G minor
Scherzo, F-sharp minor
Romanze, A minor
Perpetuum mobile, F minor
Intermezzo, D major
Toccata, A minor
Fuge, A minor
In the edition of Reger's complete works by the Max-Reger-Institute, they were published in volumes 5–7.
