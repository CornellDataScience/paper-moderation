== Reception ==
R. K. Bidur Singh wrote in e-pao.org, "Making an enterprising team with Suresh Hidang, producer-writer-lyricist, Y. Kumarjit, screen playwright, Hodam Tommy and K. Boong, cinematographer and editor, O.Geet, music director etc., he comes up with a non-conventional film-Nobap. The plight of rural folks and eight kids in desperate need of football, but unable to afford one, kicking Nobap instead-are all well expressed in a comprehensible visual language. The film is skilfully intercut with humorous romantic interludes-Thambou and Thaja; Thanou and Thoibi.
Nobap is not a story that somebody tells you just to make you feel sorry for the poor people, it has other meaning and a shot's meaning can go very far beyond the subject. The film would have been better if a few sequences, such as apparent abduction of Thambou and child kidnapping for forced labour had been trimmed. They are neither sensibly treated nor developed as meaningful sub-plot.
★★★ : One for story-screenplay, one for sincerity and realistic attempt at the film making, one for eight frolicsome kids."
