The 2015 FIM Motocross World Championship was the 59th F.I.M. Motocross World Championship season. It included 18 events, starting at Losail in Qatar on 28 February, and ending at San Bernardino, California in the United States on 20 September. In the main MXGP class, Tony Cairoli was the six-time defending champion, and entered the 2015 season looking to score a record seventh consecutive premier class title, for Red Bull KTM. He and Maximilian Nagl started the year strong, and as the German round rolled around Nagl had a 30 points lead over Cairoli and 38 over rookie Romain Febvre. Nagl got injured on practice and missed the next 5 rounds, ending his hopes of a maiden championship. Cairoli was struggling during the summer and ended up injured as well. Romain Febvre won the title and became the first french premier-class champion. In the MX2 class, Jordi Tixier was the defending champion, after taking the title in the final race of the 2014 season, also for Red Bull KTM. Tixier defends his title with Team Monster Energy Kawasaki.
