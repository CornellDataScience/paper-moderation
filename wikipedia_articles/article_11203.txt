This is a list of electors (members of the Electoral College) who cast ballots to elect the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the 1824 presidential election. 
Of the 261 electoral votes cast, 99 went to Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, 84 to John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, 41 to William H. Crawford of Georgia, and 37 to Henry Clay of Kentucky. All were members of the Democratic-Republican Party.
For the second time in United States history, no presidential candidate won a majority of the Electoral College, throwing the race to a contingent election in the U.S. House of Representatives. (Vice presidential candidate John C. Calhoun did win a majority in the Electoral College and did not face a similar contingent election in the U.S. Senate.) While Andrew Jackson had led in both the popular and electoral vote, the House of Representatives voted to name John Quincy Adams president.
In the contingent election, seven states' House delegations voted for a candidate who had not won all or most of their state's electoral votes. Illinois, Louisiana, and Maryland each went for Jackson in the Electoral College, but Adams in the House. North Carolina gave all 15 of its electoral votes to Jackson, but its House delegation voted for Crawford. Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohio all favored Clay in the Electoral College but Adams in the House. (The rules for contingent elections allowed only the top three in the electoral vote to advance, leaving Clay out. He threw his support to Adams, who later named Clay his secretary of state. Jackson partisans labeled this a "corrupt bargain.")
Jackson's plurality was a result of the Three-fifths Compromise, which let slave states count 60% of its enslaved population in calculating its House representation, thus inflating their share of Electoral College votes. If only the free population of states had been counted, Adams would have edged Jackson 83 to 77.
Unusually, two candidates — Jackson and Clay — received electoral votes for both president and vice president.
The two vice presidential votes for Martin Van Buren meant this Electoral College cast votes for the sixth (Adams), seventh (Jackson), and eighth (Van Buren) presidents. Jackson, angered at having been denied the 1824 election, ran again against Adams in 1828 and defeated him handily. He won reelection against Clay in 1832, with Van Buren as his running mate. Van Buren was then elected president in 1836 before losing reelection to William Henry Harrison in 1840.

== New York ==

For president, New York's electors cast 26 votes for John Quincy Adams, 5 votes for William H. Crawford, 4 votes for Henry Clay, and 1 vote for Andrew Jackson. For vice president, they cast 29 votes for John C. Calhoun and 7 for Nathan Sanford. (There were two different electors named Isaac Sutherland — one from Dutchess County and one from Genesee County.
There is no known record indicating which electors voted for which candidate in either race, but in news coverage before the vote, the men's preferences were listed as follows: Adams supporters (25): Blanvelt, Coffin, Coon, Clark Crandall, Edward Crandall, Dorr, James Drake, John Drake, Hicks, Lawyer, Mooers, Patterson, Sage, Savage, Azariah Smith, Benjamin Smith, Burnham, St. John, Stagg, Strong, Sutherland (Dutchess), Sutherland (Genesee), Townsend, Walsh, and Willet; Clay supporters (7): Barker, Bentley, Brooks, Porter, Russell, Sibley, and Thompson; Crawford supporters (4): Bailey, Cady, Lansing, and Samuel Smith.
Most records list Ebenezer Sage and Timothy H. Porter as electors, but contemporary news reports say neither one appeared on the day of the state's Electoral College vote. Sage sent a letter stating that "through age and ill health, he was unable to attend" the proceedings. The other electors selected John Taylor and William Mann to fill their positions, and the two men cast votes in Sage's and Taylor's place.
