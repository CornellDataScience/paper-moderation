Diário de Notícias (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈdjaɾju ðɨ nuˈtisjɐʃ]) is a Portuguese weekly newspaper published in Lisbon, Portugal. Established since 1864, the paper is considered a newspaper of record for Portugal.


== History and profile ==

Diário de Notícias was first published in Lisbon on 29 December 1864 by Tomás Quintino Antunes and Eduardo Coelho. At its early phase the paper had no explicit political stance and financially relied on the advertisements. Its headquarters is in Lisbon. During the 1880s the novelist Eça de Queiroz, then stationed in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, in the Portuguese diplomatic service, contributed occasional "London letters" to the newspaper. Some of these were afterwards published in a book entitled Cartas de Inglaterra.
Before the Carnation Revolution Diário de Notícias belonged to the Empresa Nacional de Publicidade, a propaganda arm of the dictatorship. Following the Carnation Revolution, the paper remained nationalized until the early 1990s. Then the paper and Jornal de Notícias were sold to the Lusomundo group. In 2005 the Controlinveste group bought the papers. Both papers are now owned by Angolan media conglomerate Global Media Group (formerly Controlinveste Media).
Diário de Notícias is published in tabloid format. Music critic Joaquim de Seabra Pessoa, father of poet Fernando Pessoa, worked for the paper. In 2018 Diário de Notícias became a weekly newspaper published on Saturdays.
The paper is considered a newspaper of record for Portugal.


=== Grupo BEL ===
In September 2020, the Global Media Group reached an agreement with Grupo BEL, owned by businessman Marco Galinha, for the latter to become a shareholder in the company. Grupo BEL was founded in 2001 by Marco Galinha and is active in various sectors, including the vending machine and aeronautics industries. The group entered the media sector in 2018 through Jornal Económico. Marco Galinha, originally from Rio Maior, serves as the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Grupo BEL, which he founded in 2001. In February 2021, Marco Galinha was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of Global Media Group.
At the end of 2023, Grupo BEL sold the majority of its shares in the subsidiary Páginas Civilizadas, Lda., which held a majority stake in Global Notícias – Media Group, S.A. With this transaction, the management of Global Media Group (GMG) was taken over by a new executive administration, and Marco Galinha, the founder and CEO of Grupo BEL, stepped down from his role as Chairman of the Executive Committee of GMG.
