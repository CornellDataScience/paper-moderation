== Plot ==
This drama centers on Alia Shroff, a headstrong woman who deals with her career, life with a father who disparages her absent mother, and a wish to have a child. 
In Mathura, aspiring writer Sarangdhar Pandey sees Alia on TV discussing her plan to use In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) to become a mother after divorcing her cheating husband Veer Malhotra. He comes to Mumbai and becomes an office runner at Alia’s company, “Direct Dil Se” (DDS.)
Alia’s assistant Rahul, who is unsuccessful wooing his friend Mala because she believes that he's gay, tricks Sarang into becoming the sperm donor for the IVF procedure after the original candidate cancels at the last minute.
Sarang’s father Brijmohan and old-fashioned aunt Bua disapprove of his move to Mumbai and plot to make him return. His mother Kalameshwari warns him not to go, but when Alia asks him to come to Mathura he realizes that he is attracted to her.
Although Sarang disguises himself as a Punjabi, he is recognized. Brijmohan bribes a doctor to advise Alia to stay in Mathura for at least three weeks after she faints during a family argument. Brijmohan, Bua and Elaichi (Bua’s candidate to marry Sarang)  align against Alia, Sarang and Kalameshwari in a culture conflict between traditional and progressive viewpoints. 
After Alia and Sarang’s impending parenthood is revealed, Alia tries to leave Sarang, but returns when she realizes that he was the "sweet" boy she met on her way to boarding school many years earlier.
After they learn that the pregnancy will be twins and once Alia is reassured that she won’t be abandoned again, the couple agree to marry. Alia also reconciles with her mother and learns about the lies her father had told. Alia is injured in a car accident, and after Sarang pleads on Facebook for blood donations, pulls through with a donation from Elaichi.
Sarang and Alia’s relationship becomes widely known, and Sarang’s coworker Faheem tries to frame him for wrongdoing. Sarang’s family has come to Mumbai, and he goes missing. Brijmohan is found beaten up, and the police Alia find Sarang in a warehouse. In the hospital, Sarang and Alia make vows and promise to love each other forever. 
During the wedding preparations, Sarang accepts a screenwriting job and leaves Mumbai. Multiple ominous events, or abshagun, hint that a happy ending is not certain.
Six years later, Alia and her son Agastya live in Mumbai. Alia was told that her other twin was born dead. She has sold DDS, and struggles financially as a DDS employee. Agastya, who is bullied in school, wants to meet his favorite comics author, 'Azaad Roy'.
Sarang and his daughter Sayuri live in Mathura. He and Alia decided to part ways shortly before the wedding, and have not kept in touch. Sarang has become very successful writing children’s comics as ‘Azaad Roy’, and his old flame Kavya is now his secretary. He thinks Sayuri is the only living twin.
Alia and Sarang begin to share their day-to-day experiences on an online forum for single parents. The 
doctor advises Sarang to take his daughter Sayuri, who has heart damage due to the car accident she survived before birth, to Mumbai for special treatment.
Sayuri and Agastya are schoolmates, and become friends. Alia encounters Sayuri without knowing of their relationship, and Sarang befriends Agastya under the same misconception. Alia’s job involves marketing the comic characters “Papa Toofan” (Father Storm) and “Chhotu Toofan” (Little Storm), and she makes an effort to locate ‘Azaad Roy’.
Alia’s father Gautam secretly brings her ex-husband Veer to join DDS, in order to gain her sympathy and remarry her. Her assistant Rahul, now married to Mala, works with Alia’s former employees and investors so that she can establish a new company. 
Alia and Sarang, on the anonymous single parent forum, learn that their children share a birthday and agree to prepare a special celebration, at which they will meet in person.
