== History ==
Karmiotissa was founded in 1979, and initially played in the amateur leagues organised by STOK. Their first appearance in a CFA competition came in the 1986–87 season when the club competed in the Fourth Division. The second one came in 2009, when a 4–0 win against Enosi Neon Ypsona earned Karmiotissa promotion to the Fourth Division.
Karmiotissa remained in the fourth division until the 2011–12 season, when a second-place finish meant they were promoted to the Third Division. The following season, they earned promotion for the second year in a row by winning the 2012–13 Third Division. Karmiotissa competed in the Second Division until the 2015–16 season, when they won the league to earn promotion to the First Division for the first time ever, however they were not able to avoid relegation in the 2016–17 season. They returned to the top flight in the 2020–21 season, but finished in last place and were relegated once more. Karmiotissa won the Second Division for the second time in the 2021–22 season to return to the First Division.
In 2022, Russian businessman Dmitry Punin acquired the club. Residing in the Limassol area, he is active in wine and real estate business, formerly also in gambling.
