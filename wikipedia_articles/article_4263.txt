Montserrat (Eastern Calatan: [munsəˈrat]), or Maria Montserrat, after the Virgin of Montserrat, is a popular name for girls in Catalonia and several other parts of Catalan-speaking areas. It was the second most common given name for women in Catalonia in 2014, according to the Catalan Statistics Institute.
The name is traditionally abbreviated to Montse, Serrat, Rat, Rateta, Tat or Tóna, and more recently, due to foreign influence, also to Monse. 
The name day for Montserrat is celebrated on April 27.
Sometimes this name appears in the Spanish-speaking world as a given name as is, or sometimes translated as Montserrate or Monserrate (where the final "e" is pronounced /e̞/).
