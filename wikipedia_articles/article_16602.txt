Samuel Tobias Holmén (born 28 June 1984) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.
Holmén's favourite position was in the central midfield, and his style of play was that of a box-to-box player, being a good defensive ball winner, as well as a good playmaker and goal scorer.
Starting off his career with IF Elfsborg in 2002, he went on to play in Denmark and Turkey before returning to Elfsborg and Swedish football in 2017. He retired from professional football in 2021.
A full international between 2006 and 2013, he won 32 caps for the Sweden national team and represented his country at UEFA Euro 2012.
