== Biography ==
Born to a farmer family, Goihenetxe went to Great Britain to study. After completing French High School in Roazhon in 1963, he was ordained friar in the congregation of Ploermael in 1967. In 1969, he graduated in history at Toulouse, and started working as a teacher. Goihenetxe also got the teacher certification (DEA) at Pau in 1981. He earned his PhD in 1984. As a teacher, he got job positions in Oloron, Lourdes, Donibane Lohizune and Kastellin (Brittany).
Goihenetxe wrote for the association "Ikas" from 1972 to 1983. He assumed the chief managerial position of the UEU from 1977 to 1979. On 27 July 1975, he was named associate member by Euskaltzaindia and made partner of Eusko Ikaskuntza. He was Basque school network Seaska's first worker on a payroll as an instructor (1977-1981), as well as holding other responsibilities in Kanbo, Baiona, and Ziburu (1981-2003). He was also a professor at the University of Pau and Baiona (Bayonne).
Goihenetxe could speak seven languages, i.e. Basque, French, Latin, English, Spanish, Gascon Occitan, and Aragonese. Thanks to his command of these languages, he carried out comprehensive research on the Basque Country. He showed a special commitment for Basque culture and abertzale politics. He got first involved in politics during the Process of Burgos (1970). He was a founder of the political parties Embata and EHAS.
Goihenetxe was registered in the census of Anglet (Labourd) for many years and was also the Basque nationalist candidate of South Anglet in 1999. He devoted one of his books to this town of Labourd.
On 2 May 2004, Goihenetxe accidentally died at Biscau, a mountain in Bearn, along with his partner Anne-Marie Pargade. His ashes were spread in Errozate, near his home village of Ezterenzubi.
