Al-Attawi's artistic journey showcases a profound engagement with the evolving cultural landscape of Saudi Arabia. His work is a testament to the country's growing support for the creative arts (during the MBS era) and its embrace of artists who push the boundaries of conventional artistic norms. One of his notable achievements is being a recipient of the inaugural Misk Art Grant, an accolade that highlights his significant contributions to the contemporary art scene in Saudi Arabia. The artwork "Blind Ants" stands as a prime example of Al-Attawi's innovative approach to artistic expression, reflecting his commitment to exploring new avenues of creativity within the realm of Saudi culture and beyond.
Al-Attawi's portfolio is marked by thought-provoking pieces that delve into profound themes and societal narratives. "Connection" (2019), is a striking embodiment of this approach, as it intricately weaves together sacred symbolism and modern technology. Through a series of small plastic pieces that count and record dhikr, reminiscent of Islamic prayer beads, the artwork draws parallels to Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. This piece serves as a profound exploration of the interplay between spiritual devotion and technological innovation, contributing to the ongoing discourse within contemporary art.
A key aspect of Al-Attawi's artistic narrative lies in his engagement with Saudi cultural heritage and his dedication to preserving historical legacies. The artwork "Al Nourhah Pillars" (2021), featured at the Diriyah Biennale, exemplifies this commitment. Situated within the broader context of the exhibition's thematic exploration, the piece stands as a testament to Al-Attawi's contribution to discussions surrounding societal transformation and historical continuity in Saudi Arabia.
Al-Attawi's work extends beyond the realm of aesthetics, as he masterfully uses his art to engage with complex societal issues. "Maze of Delusion" is a striking testament to this approach, where approximately 800 cement barriers, originally symbols of defense against terrorist threats, are employed to convey Riyadh's historical narrative and transformation within the context of contemporary art. This thought-provoking installation reflects Al-Attawi's nuanced perspective on the societal impact of terrorism and ideological conflicts.
Al-Attawi's artistic prowess extends to his transformation of everyday elements of Saudi life into intricate and meaningful artistic expressions. His deep connection to the desert landscape and his commitment to social engagement result in works that resonate with cultural significance while offering a fresh perspective on contemporary art. "Dwelling" (December, 2020), an exhibition in which Al-Attawi featured as a key artist, exemplifies his ability to encapsulate the dynamism and evolving narrative of Arab societies within his creative vision.
In 2016, Al-Attawi co-founded Wasm Studio, an artistic and cultural community hub based in Riyadh, with contemporary saudi artist Saad Howede.
