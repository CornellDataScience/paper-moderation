The World Organization of Workers (WOW) is an international trade union federation.


== History ==
WOW was founded in September 1921, as the International Federation of Christian Employees' Trade Unions.  After several name changes, it became the World Federation of Clerical Workers (WFCW).  The WFCW joined the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (IFCTU), which was later called the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). On October 31, 2006, the WCL was dissolved when it joined with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to form the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC). Rather than join ITUC, the WFCW decided to function as an independent trade union federation under the name World Organization of Workers (WOW).


== Malta World Congress ==
WOW held its first World Congress from November 2 to 9, 2008, in Malta. It was at this conference that the name World Organization of Workers (WOW) was formally adopted. Also at this conference two resolutions were adopted. The first resolution dealt with Social dialogue, International Labour Standards and Social Justice. The second resolution promoted a new balance within corporate governance structures.
