The Danel Quartet (or Quatuor Danel) is a French/Belgian string quartet established in June 1991. Known for classical, early modern and contemporary repertoire, they tour internationally and have an extensive discography. They have both recorded and performed the first complete cycle of string quartets by Mieczysław Weinberg and have undertaken a complete cycle of the quartets of Dmitri Shostakovich as well.


== History ==
The ensemble has worked with the Amadeus Quartet. For Shostakovich's complete string quartets, it worked with the Borodin Quartet and Fyodor Druzhinin of the Beethoven Quartet and also with Pierre Penassou and Walter Levin, both members of the LaSalle Quartet. The Danel Quartet performs the classical repertoire as well as contemporary music. They are specialized in the Russian repertoire. Their recordings of Shostakovich's and Weinberg's quartets (world premiere) are a reference.
Since 2005, the Danel Quartet has been "Quartet in Residence" at the University of Manchester, and since 2016, in residence at TivoliVredenburg, Utrecht. From 2019 to 2021, they were in residence at the Wigmore Hall for a complete double of Shostakovich and Weinberg's string quartets.
