In qualifying for the 2024 Summer Olympics, a total of 68 climbers, with an equal distribution between men and women, will compete across two separate competition climbing disciplines at these Games for the first time, namely: a unique competition bouldering-and-competition lead climbing combined event, and a separate competition speed climbing event.


== Qualification summary ==


== Boulder and lead combined ==
A total of 40 climbers (twenty per gender) will compete in the men's and women's competition bouldering-and-competition lead climbing combined event for Paris 2024. Each NOC could only send a maximum of four climbers with an equal split between men and women. Quota places are allocated to the athletes by name. These qualification spots will be awarded as follows:

World Championships – The three highest-ranked climbers in each of the two events will obtain a quota place, respecting a two-member limit for their NOC.
Continental Qualification Events – The highest-ranked eligible male and female climber at each of the five continental qualifying tournaments (Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania) will obtain a quota place, respecting a two-member limit for his or her NOC.
Olympic Qualifier Series – The top ten male and female climbers after a series of two events in 2024 will obtain a quota place, respecting a two-member limit for their NOC. The list of athletes who will compete for these places has been published by the IFSC.
Host country – As the host country, France reserves one quota place each for the men's and women's boulder-and-lead combined events. If one or more French sport climbers qualify regularly and directly through the world championships or their respective continental meet, the host country slots will be reallocated.
Universality places – Two invitational places will be entitled to eligible NOCs interested to have their sport climbers compete in Paris 2024 as granted by the Universality principle.
Reallocation – Unused quota spots for host country and universality will be reallocated to the next eligible climbers from the Olympic Qualifier series.
