This timeline of the Israel–Hezbollah conflict covers the period from 1 April 2024, when Israel struck the Iranian consulate in Damascus, to 26 July 2024, one day before the Majdal Shams attack.
After the consulate airstrike, which killed 16 people including 2 Iranian generals, Iran retaliated with drone and missile strikes on Israel, their first direct attack on Israel since the start of their proxy conflict. Nobody was killed in Iran's retaliatory strikes, however many people were treated for minor injuries with 1 child critically injured. Iran's response was seen as "limited", pleasing hardliners calling for a response whilst limiting escalation, not wanting to provoke a full scale war with Israel and the US. Iran repeatedly signalled to the US that their response would be "contained", via diplomatic back-channels, and that it had no desire for a war with the US, which the US reciprocated.
