Garnjost graduated from Cornell University with an A.B. in 1917. During World War I, he was commissioned a first lieutenant with the 22nd Infantry. After the War, he entered Columbia Law School and graduated from there with an LL.B. in 1921. He also studied political science and received an M.A. at Columbia. After he was admitted to the bar, he worked with the firm Geller, Rolston & Blanc in New York City. In 1923, he opened law offices in Yonkers. His law offices were in Philipsburgh Building for over a decade, although he later moved to the First National Bank Building. He was also a director of the Westchester First National Corporation, the Central National Bank of Yonkers, and the Garnjost Realty Company.
In 1923, Garnjost was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Republican, representing the Westchester County 4th District.
