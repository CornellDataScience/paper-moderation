Charles Tomlinson (1808 – 1897), was a scientist who published papers on meteorology and the physical properties of liquids.


== Biography ==
He studied science under George Birkbeck, the founder of the London Mechanics' Institute. For a while, he had a school with his brother Lewis, at Salisbury. Becoming known for original investigation, he was called to London, where he was appointed lecturer on experimental science at King's College School. During the 1840s and 1850s he published several notable scientific works relating to phenomena of the weather for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. In 1872 he was elected to the Royal Society, and in 1874 he took a leading part in founding the Physical Society. As a scientist Tomlinson made valuable contributions to the knowledge of the surface tension of liquids. His last years were devoted to literature, and he held the Dante lectureship at University College 1878–1880. He was also an avid chess player and published a book on this subject, Amusements in Chess, in 1845.
His wife was the author Sarah Windsor Tomlinson who predeceased him in 1872 and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. Charles Tomlinson was later buried in the same grave (plot no.19920), but the grave is now under a footpath and has no headstone.
