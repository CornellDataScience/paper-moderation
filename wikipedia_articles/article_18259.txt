A Pennsylvania native, Wasserman earned his B.S. in 1942 from the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. He then worked for Merck and Company, and later with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) before his retirement in the late 1970s or early 1980s. During the same period Dr. Wasserman's Lab at USDA outside of Philadelphia pioneered the area of nitrosamine formation in cured meats.
Wasserman was named a fellow of the Institute of Food Technologists in 1979. Wasserman served as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Food Science from 1981 to 1990.
Aaron Wasserman retired to the Philadelphia area, and died of natural cause on 5 July 2015.
