In a 1971 interview, Struever shared of her experiences as a doctoral student that, "...attitudes among the faculty ranged from encouraging to horrified. My worst problem was that U of R would not give me a graduate fellowship, because history obviously could only be my avocation, not my vocation. They didn't think I could be serious, so I spent two years as a teaching assistant without pay, in order to get my teaching credits."
