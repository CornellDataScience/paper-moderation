Shadowfax was a new-age/electronic musical group formed in Chicago in the early 1970s and best known for their albums Shadowfax and Folksongs for a Nuclear Village. In 1989, they won the Grammy for Best New Age Performance for Folksongs for a Nuclear Village. In 1993, they were nominated for the Grammy for Esperanto.
The group formed in 1972 and disbanded after 1995 when lyricon player and leader Chuck Greenberg died of a heart attack. Having lost their signature sound, Shadowfax's members went on to other projects.
The group took its name from Gandalf the Grey's horse Shadowfax in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.
