== History ==
Jan Arcer, a Dutch settler (who anglicized his name to John Archer), established a community at what is now 225th Street near the Harlem River in 1666. Archer owned 3900 acres of land which Francis Lovelace, the colonial governor of New York approved for settlement. The area known as "Fordham Manor" was 6 square miles. This was called a Patent, making Archer  "Lord of the Manor". Sixteen families established farms in the area. The Manor lasted from 1671 to 1762.
Archer chose the name Fordham for his community, which may have been a reference to its location near a shallow crossing ("ford") of the Bronx River, or may have been a reference to John Fordham, a fourteenth-century English priest.


=== Old Fordham Village ===
Old Fordham Village is a section of Fordham that dates back to the English colonial era. It is centered on the intersection of the Grand Concourse and Fordham Road. Fordham Village extends north to about 196th Street, south to about 187th Street, east to Southern Boulevard, and west to Jerome Avenue.
The section's origins date back to about 1751, when Fordham Manor was built on what was called Rose Hill. Most of the estate is part of the Rose Hill Campus of Fordham University. Besides the main manor house and other side buildings on the campus, other historic buildings and noted homes still exist within Old Fordham Village. For example, American poet Edgar Allan Poe spent his final years with his wife Virginia in a cottage in Fordham, which is still standing in Poe Park. The nearby Fordham University Church bell is named "old Edgar" and may have been the inspiration for his poem The Bells.
In the 18th century, the Kings Road went through Old Fordham Village, an area of rural estates and small farms, linking Colonial New York and towns and villages north toward  Boston. It was a minor rest stop for travelers and coaches, where many springs fed The Mill Brook that crossed this road. During the American Revolution, it was a critical crossing point for Gen. George Washington's Continental Army retreating toward White Plains to safely escape from New York while being chased by the Colonial British and Hessian Forces. There were many American Patriots that lived in this area. After the revolution, the Kings Road was renamed the Boston Post Road, becoming an important thoroughfare for a growing new nation.
In the 19th century, with the building of the White Plains Line (later the Harlem Line of the New York Central Railroad) and a small station, Old Fordham Village began to grow. Local farmers and dairymen were able to use the railroad to send their products to a growing New York City. Part of the Mill Brook was dammed up north of the village, and a large pond and ice house were built for shipping and cold storage. It provided fresh ice for the community and the railroad. In 1838, a wealthy New York City Irish Catholic real estate magnate named Andrew Carrigan (1804-1872) bought the 100-acre Rose Hill estate, located east of the village, for the sole purpose of selling it to his close friend John Joseph Hughes (1797-1864), who at the time was coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of New York. Hughes purchased the estate from Carrigan in 1839 for $29,750, and founded St. Joseph's Seminary (1840) and St. Joseph's College (1841) (later Fordham University) on the property. In 1846 Hughes deeded St. Joseph's College over to the Roman Catholic Jesuit Order (Society of Jesus) for $40,000, but retained title to the seminary property (about 9 acres of land). The seminary was closed in 1859. Today, a small south-west portion of the former Rose Hill estate is known as Rose Hill Park.  West of the village, on the other side of Fordham Hill, the Bathgate Estate was built; it was later acquired by wealthy stock speculator Leonard Jerome. He built the Jerome Park Racetrack, where the first Belmont Stakes was held, on his estate. West of the station in the village area, the Fordham Hotel and Taverine would provide basic needs for visitors to the college and the racetrack.


=== After 1900 ===

For the most part, Old Fordham Village remained rural until about 1900, when New York City began to expand. Early mass transit to the suburbs changed the area of what is Fordham today. Old Fordham Village and the surrounding area would become part of the borough of the Bronx within New York City.  Many remaining farms and estates were sold to developers who built houses and sizable apartment buildings. The formerly quiet little village became a major business and transportation hub. In this area of Fordham, Boston Post Road was renamed Fordham Road and became part of U.S. Route 1 in 1926. The rebuilding of the railroad right of way at Fordham, and most of Webster Avenue, eliminated The Mill Brook and water pond, but the side streets of Old Fordham Village remain active.
Fordham was a predominantly middle class White (of Irish and Jewish origins) neighborhood from the 1920s through the late 1970s, when many families moved to the suburbs or the Los Angeles area, or retired to Florida.  Belmont was formerly a portion of Fordham and South Fordham.
On January 9, 2022, a high-rise fire tore through an apartment building in Fordham. At least 19 people were killed, including nine children, and at least 60 other people were injured, including 32 with life-threatening injuries. It was the third-deadliest residential fire in the U.S. since 1978.


== Demographics ==

Fordham has a population of around 43,394 people. Its first growth was in the 1920s, when middle-class and working-class families from Manhattan flocked into the area, attracted by the then-modern housing and convenient subway access by Concourse, Jerome Avenue, and Third/Webster Avenues lines to business districts in Manhattan where they could work and shop. It is now predominantly Latino American and African American. There is a significant historic Italian and Albanian population as well.
