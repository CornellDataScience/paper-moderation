=== Descendants ===
Through his eldest son, he was a grandfather of Sir Andrew Rowland Hodge, 3rd Baronet (b. 1968), Wendy Madeleine Hodge (second wife of John Kidd, and mother of Jemma Wellesley, Countess of Mornington, supermodel Jodie Kidd and polo player Jack Kidd), Vicki Hodge (one-time girlfriend of both John Bindon and Prince Andrew, Duke of York), and model Sally Joan Hodge (mother of Anthony Joseph Hodge Clavien and Alana Nicole Hodge Sindelar).


== In popular culture ==
The BBC programme Who Do You Think You Are? broadcast on 24 September 2008, in which model Jodie Kidd traced her ancestors (Hodge was her great-grandfather), suggested that he may have bought his honour from David Lloyd George, part of the scandal that led to the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925.
The programme reported that the archives of Parliament contain letters to Lloyd George, from Winston Churchill complaining of having been offered a bribe of £5,000, and from King George V complaining of the honour having been granted.
