Historical sources of the Crusades: pilgrimages and exploration include those authors whose work describes pilgrimages to the Holy Land and other explorations to the Middle East and Asia that are relevant to Crusader history. In his seminal article in the Catholic Encyclopedia, Dominican friar and historian Bede Jarrett (1881–1934) wrote on the subject of Pilgrimage and identified that the "Crusades also naturally arose out of the idea of pilgrimages." This was reinforced by the Reverend Florentine Stanislaus Bechtel in his article Itineraria in the same encyclopedia. Pilgrims, missionaries, and other travelers to the Holy Land have documented their experiences through accounts of travel and even guides of sites to visit. Many of these have been recognized by historians, for example, the travels of ibn Jubayr and Marco Polo. Some of the more important travel accounts are listed here. Many of these are also of relevance to the study of historical geography and some can be found in the publications of the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society (PPTS) and Corpus Scriptorum Eccesiasticorum Latinorum (CSEL), particularly CSEL 39, Itinerarium Hierosolymitana. Much of this information is from the seminal work of 19th-century scholars including Edward Robinson, Titus Tobler and Reinhold Röhricht. Recently, the Independent Crusaders Project has been initiated by the Fordham University Center for Medieval Studies providing a database of Crusaders (with sources identified) who traveled to the Holy Land independent of military expeditions.


== Overview ==
Authors who wrote about their travels or pilgrimages to the Holy Land or to the land of the Mongols were prevalent through the 16th century, and lasted into the 19th century. Some were accounts by merchants trading with non-European partners.
Notable early travelers include Marco Polo, ibn Battūta, Odoric of Pordenone, John Mandeville, Bertrandon de la Broquière, Marino Sanuto the Younger, and Felix Fabri.Later travelers to include diplomats, were Jean Thenaud, Evliya Çelebi, and Richard Burton. Surveys of the Holy Land were sponsored by the Palestine Exploration Fund, beginning in 1864, including those by Claude R. Conder, Edward Hull, and Herbert Kitchener.
Collections of those works, as well as Crusader-era accounts that are in the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society (PPTS) library (1886–1897), the Hakluyt Society (founded 1846) and the Societé de l'Orient Latin (founded 1875 by Paul Riant) that include Itinera hierosolymitana et descriptiones terrae sanctae... (1879) by Titus Tobler and Auguste Molinier; and Itinéraires à Jérusalem et descriptions de la Terre Sainte... (1882) by Henri-Victor Michelant and Gaston Raynaud. Other collections include Recueil de voyages... (1882–1916) by Charles Henri Auguste Schefer and Henri Cordier; Early Travels in Palestine (1848) by Thomas Wright; Cathay and the Way Thither (1866) by Henry Yule; and those identified in Titus Tobler's Bibliographia Geographica Palestinæ.

== Holy Relics ==
The study of the relics of Christianity is closely tied to pilgrimages as well as to the Crusades where relics were obtained either from the Holy Land or by theft from Constantinople. By the 3rd century, pilgrimages to the Holy Land had begun and the search for relics started in the 4th century by Saint Helena. Additional information on the translation of relics of the saints can be found in Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina. Islam also recognizes relics dating from the time Abraham through that of the Prophet, known as the Sacred Trust, some of which are also relevant to Christianity.
The Recueil des historiens des croisades, Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII, contains Documenta Lipsanographica ad I. bellum sacrum spectantia (Relics of the Holy Land), which is a collection of eleven accounts of relics of the Holy Land written from 1098 to 1125. Included are discussions of the translation of relics of Christ and the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, Saints George, Nicholas, Basil and Stephen, the patriarchs at Hebron, among others.

True Cross. The True Cross is first mentioned in the pilgrimage of Saint Helena from 326 to 328, with her finding relics of the Cross, including nails and the Titulus Crucis. This is described in Socrates Scholasticus' Historia Ecclesiastica, and later in Egeria's Itinerarium Egeriae.  Held in Jerusalem, it was lost to the Sassanids in 614, and returned by Heraclius in 630. With the loss of Jerusalem to the Fatimids in 1109, the relic was hidden by local Christians.  The Cross' recovery by the Crusaders in 1099 is described in the works of Raymond of Aguilers, Fulcher of Chartres and William of Tyre.  It was again in 1187, this time to Saladin who also viewed it as important to Islam.  In 1219, it was offered to the Knights Templar in exchange for the lifting of the siege of Damietta, but never delivered.  Most relics known today came from Constantinople after 1204, including two large pieces purloined by Robert de Clari.
Seamless Robe of Jesus. The seamless robe of Jesus, also known as the Holy Coat, was also alleged to have been claimed by Saint Helena. The biography of St. Agritius, bishop of Trier, written before 1072, describes the relic being sent by Helena to Trier.
Search for Relics in the 4th Century. Authorities such as poet Prudentius (348 – after 405), author of Liber Peristephanon (Crowns of Martyrdom) and Carmina, and Magnus Felix Ennodius, bishop of Pavia (473/474-521) author of Libellum pro Synodo, taught that they Christian saints and martyrs could perform miracles and encouraged the search for holy relics. This view was continued by Saint Ambrose (c. 340–397), archbishop of Milan, whose Epistolae (Letter XXII) was an inspiration to acquire relics from the Holy Land; by Saint Basil (330-378) in a letter to Saint Ambrose; and by Victricius, bishop of Rouen (c. 330 – c. 407), in his Liber de Laude Sanctorum (On the Praise of the Saints).
Saint Eudocia. Saint Eudocia (c. 401 – 460), a Byzantine empress married to Theodosius II who went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 438–439, returning with numerous holy relics.
Holy Lance. The Holy Lance is a legendary relic with competing claims of legitimacy.  It was reported by Antoninus Martyr in his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 570, as well as other sources.  Peter Bartholomew made claims to the discovery of the lance during the siege of Antioch in 1098, as reported in Gesta Francorum and by Raymond of Aguilers. Those claims were disputed by Adhemar of Le Puy. An account of the recovery of point of the Holy Lance by Byzantine emperor Heraclius is found in the Chronicon Paschale (7th century).
Holy Chalice. Relics associated with the Holy Chalice (Holy Grail) are first seen by Arculf in his Pilgrimage, mentioning a chalice used in the Last Supper in a chapel near Jerusalem. Two actual relics are known. Sacro Cationno is a hexagonal dish returned to Italy by Genoese Crusaders in 1101, as described by William of Tyre and in the 13th century work the Golden Legend. The Chalice of Valencia was first identified in 1134 and is of unknown origin, although a theory is that it accompanied Saint Peter in his journey to Rome.
Relics of John the Baptist.  The relics of John the Baptist are discussed in Legenda translationis beatissimi Johannis Baptistæ Genuam (1098), edited by Jacobus de Voragine, and Nicolai de Porta, Historia translations reliquiarum beatissimi Johannes Baptistæ Genuam (compiled 1405). In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII.i and VII.ii.
Relic of Saint George. Saint George (died 303) was the patron saint of the First Crusade, and his relic was given to Robert II of Flanders who returned to Europe in 1098. The account of the sacred relic of Saint George is provided in the anonymous Narratio quo modo relliquiæ martyris Georgii ad nos Aquicinenses pervenerunt(1100). In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII.iii.
Relics of Saint Sabbas. The relics of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified (439–532) were taken by Crusaders in the 13th century as a result of the War of Saint Sabas (1256–1270), and taken to the Church of Saint Anthony in Venice. His biography is provided in the Life of St. Saba by Cyril of Scythopolis (439–532). In the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society (PPTS) library, Volume XI.1.
Translatio sancti Nicolai. Translatio Sancti Nicolai in Venetiam is an anonymous eyewitness 12th century account of Venetian contributions to the Crusades, including a description of the siege of Haifa of 1100. It was later rewritten to provide context to the translation of the relics of Saint Nicholas to Bari. It has been speculated that the author of Translatio was Gallus Anonymous. In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII.iv).
Relics of Watten Abbey. In 1097, Robert II of Flanders returned home with relics given to him by Roger Borsa. As recorded by a charter of his wife Clementia of Burgundy, these included the hair of the Virgin Mary and the bones of Saints Matthew and Saint Nicholas, and were taken to Watten Abbey. A full account is given in the anonymous Qualiter reliquiæ B. Nicolai, episcopi et confessoris, ad Lotharingiæ villam, quæ Portus nominatur, delatæ sunt (1101). In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII and Heinrich Hagenmeyer's Die Kreuzzugsbriefe aus den Jahren, 1088-1100, VII.
Relics of Saints Basil, Stephen and Others. The translations of the relics of Saint Basil and Saint Stephen are described in Qualiter tabula s. Basilii Cluniacum delata fuitit (1112) and Tractus de Reliquiis s. Stephani, Cluniacum Delatis (1120).  The translation of the remains of Saints Nicodème, Gamaliel, Abibon to Pisa are described in Gesta Triumphalia Pisanorum in Captione Jerusalem. In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII.vi, VII.ix, VIII.vii.
Shroud of Cadouin. The translation of the Holy Shroud of Cadouin (le Saint-Suaire de Cadouin) to Cadouin Abbey is described in Pancarta Caduniensis (Charter of Cadouin), Seu historia santa sudarii Jesu Christi habita ab Adhemaro episcopo, Antiochiæ, anno incarnationis Domini MIIC, in ecclesiale Caduniensem translati(1117).  The shroud is believed to be the facecloth from the tomb of Christ.  The account claims the relic was linked to Adhemar of Le Puy, brought from Antioch by a priest of Périgord, but it is not documented at the abbey until 1215.  In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII.vii.
Tractatus Inventione Sanctorum Patriarcharum. The work (Canonici Hebronensis)Tractatus Inventione Sanctorum Patriarcharum Abraham, Ysaac et Jacob, by an anonymous author was dictated by two monks of Hebron c. 1119. It describes a sanctuary at Hebron existing on the site of the tombs of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob before the First Crusade, and the failed attempt of Theodosius II to return the bodies of the patriarchs to Constantinople. The sepulchral crypt was despoiled by Peter of Narbonne. In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII.viii.
Cerbano Cerbani. Cerbano Cerbani (fl. 1125) was an Italian scholar who wrote Translatio mirifici martyris Isidori a Chio insula in civitatem Venetam (1125), describing the translation of the body of the martyr Isidore of Chios to the Basilica of Saint Mark's in Venice.  The work is also a partial autobiography, providing the only information known about Cerbani. In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII.x.
Reliquiis Sanctæ Crucis. A work by an anonymous monk from Schaffhausen called De Reliquiis Sanctæ Crucis et Dominici Sepulcri Scaphusam Allatis (1125) describes the translation of relics of three martyrs from the Holy Land. In RHC Historiens occidentaux, Volume 5.VII.xi.
The Conquest of Constantinople. Robert de Clari's La Conquête de Constantinople provides an account of the relics of Constantinople and the looting of those treasures.  He was one of the last to see the Shroud of Turin prior to 1258 when Geoffroi de Charny and his wife reported ownership.  Robert reportedly donated a Byzantine crystal cross reliquary to Corbie Abbey. The plunder of Nivelon of Chérisy, bishop of Soissons, apparently included the heads of seven saints and the crown of St. Mark's head. Conrad of Krosigk also returned with many relics, as reported in the Deeds of the Bishops of Halberstadt.
Exuviae Sacrae Constantinoploitanae. Exuviae Sacrae Constantinoploitanae (1877–1888) is a collection of documents edited by Paul Riant relating to the status of relics at Constantinople before 1204 and their disposition after the Fourth Crusade. A further study La croix des premiers croisés; la sainte lance; la sainte couronne was published by Fernand de Mély in 1904.
Crown of Thorns. In 1241, Baldwin II, the last Latin emperor ruling from Constantinople, sold the Crown of Thorns and assorted other relics associated with Christ's Passion to Louis IX of France, as recounted in Joinville's biography Life of Saint Louis.  Louis built the Sainte-Chapelle to house it.
