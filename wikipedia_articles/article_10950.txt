Dorothy Hindman (born March 13, 1966) is an American composer and music educator.


== Early life and studies ==
Born in Miami, Florida on March 13, 1966, Hindman had intense early exposure to classical music from her mother, Dorothy Hindman Lyon, a gifted classical pianist and scientist, and her father, William Murphy Hindman, an actor and manager at that time of WTMI, Miami's classical radio station. Formal music study began late for her, at age 16, when she entered Miami-Dade College as a piano major with the intention to study synthesis. This path led her to avant-garde electronic music and at 19 she began a composition major at the University of Miami, studying with composer Dennis Kam, and graduating magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Music in 1988. Her studies continued at Duke University with Stephen Jaffe and Thomas Oboe Lee, receiving her Master of Arts in the composition in 1989. In 1990, she became a University Fellow at the University of Miami, resuming her studies with Dennis Kam, with whom she shared deep interests in philosophy, musical meaning, individual perception, originality, and profundity. In Novemberâ€“December 1994, she completed additional studies at the Atlantic Center for the Arts with composer Louis Andriessen, reflected in her interests in the formal structures of Bach and Stravinsky as well as her adaptations of social and popular influences in her music.

== Music ==


=== Organization ===
Hindman's music is unique and multilayered, revealing deep organization on every level. Elements of her personal style include economy of materials; works such as "drowningXnumbers" for amplified cello (1994 for Craig Hultgren) show intense extension and development of a single idea to create complex organic structures. She favors symmetrical harmonies and consonance, and uses timbre as a structural element. Recent works employ spectral techniques. Form arises from the material, with juxtaposition, fragmentation, and combination serving to prolong moods throughout a work. Driving, motoric rhythms contribute immediate surface impact to the music.


=== Politics and social commentary ===
Hindman's work usually deals with political themes and the history of places, and how that history is distorted through the lens of contemporary individual perception. Some works, such as Monumenti for violin and cello and centro for violin and piano, both written at the American Academy in Rome in 2005, explore the relationship of the modern individual to the physical and artistic remains of past civilizations. More recent works such as Tapping the Furnace for speaking percussionist (2006) and Nine Churches for guitar quartet and chamber orchestra (2006-7) focus on the cultural, social and economic legacies of industrialization, slavery, and racist policies in the New South.
Hindman's most recent works, R.I.P.T. (2014) for speaking saxophonist and percussionist and Rough Ride (2016) for speaking cello, are part of her Trademarking Trayvon cycle for chamber orchestra Bent Frequency of Atlanta, exploring and musically integrating ideas and emblems of African American expressions of grief and outrage in the wake of the epidemic of gun violence and murder of black men and women, specifically focusing on the ways in which protest became product around the most sensationalized cases.


=== Autobiographical works ===
Her work is often autobiographical, responding in structural ways to events as they unfold and affect her work. Metric schemes correspond to meaningful numeric patterns such as telephone numbers; harmonic structures may be based upon names, dates, places; emotional levels are subtle, complex, and varied within a single work. Needlepoint, Magic City, Seconds, Time Management, Taut, Setting Century, Cascade)


=== Phenomenological influences ===
Her work is usually perceptually based in the individual (Drift, Jerusalem Windows, Monumenti), informed by her own phenomenological investigations of how music functions, based on the writings of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. There is often, as with history, a presentation of incomplete ideas, which are intended to be completed in the mind of the listener. It is a language of connotations; within each piece, a new syntax is fully established to allow the perceptive, active listener to respond to or to complete fragmentary statements, which the composer, in turn, comments upon, verifies or denies later in the work. There is a deliberate engagement of the listener, a demand upon one's attention which is rewarded through correspondence.
