Changsha Huanghua International Airport (IATA: CSX, ICAO: ZGHA) is an international airport serving Changsha, the capital of South Central China’s Hunan province, and the Greater Changsha Metropolitan Region comprising the nearby cities of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan.
As of 2021, it was one of the 50 busiest airports in the world, the 12th busiest civil airport in China, the second busiest in South Central China after Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and the busiest in Central China.
Located about 25 kilometres (16 mi) from downtown Changsha in the town of Huanghua in Changsha County, the airport has two terminal buildings. The airport is managed by the Hunan Airport Authority, a publicly owned corporation managing all five airports in Hunan Province. Huanghua airport was opened in August 1989, replacing Changsha Datuopu Airport, which is now a military air base.


== History ==
From 1957 to 1989, Datuopu Airport served as a dual-use military and civil airport for Changsha. It was only capable of handling small aircraft and a few flights per day. The Hunan Provincial Government proposed the construction of a new airport in October 1984, which was approved by the State Council of China. Construction for Huanghua Airport began in June 1986, and it was opened on 29 August 1989, when all civil flights were transferred to the new airport, and Datuopu reverted to sole military use.
On 28 October 2000, the 34,000 m2 (370,000 sq ft) Terminal 1-A, which cost 40.4 million CNY, was opened. The airport was capable of handling 4.6 million passengers per year. Afterwards, the construction of Terminal 1-B and Terminal 1-C were finished to ensure growing passengers and cargo.
The airport then went through a major expansion in 2008–2011, with lengthening of runway 18/36 from 2,600 metres (8,500 ft) to 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) and the addition of Terminal 2 which went into operation in 2011. The airport welcomed its first intercontinental destination when China Southern Airlines began service to Frankfurt, Germany on 23 June 2014.
The construction of the second runway was completed in November 2016. The new 3,800-by-60-metre (12,470 ft × 200 ft) Code-4F runway was built parallel to the current 18/36 runway and lies 380 metres (1,250 ft) to the east. The second runway officially came into use on 30 March 2017. The new runway means that Huanghua Airport is now ranked as a 4F, the highest level for an airport, and capable of accommodating wide-body aircraft such as the A380.
On 16 May 2018, the renovated Terminal 1 of the Changsha Huanghua International Airport resumed operation. The domestic flights operated by Air China, Shenzhen Airlines, Shandong Airlines, Chengdu Airlines, Kunming Airlines, Okay Airways, Joy Air, and Tibet Airlines arrive at T1.
