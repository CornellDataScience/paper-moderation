The Voice Kids is a Russian reality television singing competition broadcast on Channel One. Based on the original The Voice Kids of Holland, the concept of the series is to find currently unsigned singing talent (solo or duets, professional and amateur) contested by aspiring singers, age 6 to 15, drawn from public auditions. The winner is determined by television viewers voting by SMS text and The Voice Kids App.
The winners of the eleven seasons have been: Alisa Kozhikina, Sabina Mustaeva, Danil Pluzhnikov, Elizaveta Kachurak, Rutger Garecht, 9 finalists of the sixth season, Olesya Kazachenko, Vladislav Tyukin, Adelia  Zagrebina, Anna Dorovskaya, and Vasily Igolkin.
The series employs a panel of three coaches who critique the artists' performances and guide their teams of selected artists through the remainder of the season. They also compete to ensure that their act wins the competition, thus making them the winning coach. The original panel featured Dima Bilan (seasons 1–4, 11-), Pelageya (seasons 1–3, and 5–6), and Maxim Fadeev (seasons 1–2). The panel for the most recent eleventh season featured Dima Bilan (seasons 1–4, 11-), Yulianna Karaulova (season 11-) and JONY (season 11-) Other coaches include Leonid Agutin (season 3), Nyusha (season 4), Valery Meladze (seasons 4–7), LOBODA (seasons 6 and 8), Polina Gagarina (seasons 7 and 9), Basta (seasons 5, and 7–10), Egor Kreed (seasons 8―10) and MakSim (season 10). 
The Voice Kids began airing on February 28, 2014, as a winter-spring TV season programme. The show proved to be a hit for Channel  One.
In 2023, there was a spin-off called «The Voice. No Longer Kids», which features former participants competing in a fashion similar to the All-Stars version that originated in France.


== Conception ==
An adaptation of the Dutch show The Voice Kids, Channel One announced the show under the name Голос. Дети (The Voice Kids).
In each season, the winner receives ₽500,000 (about $8,000) and a record deal with Universal Music Group.


== Selection process and format ==
Blind auditions
Each season begins with the "Blind Auditions," where coaches form their team of artists (15 artists in each team) whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read "Я выбираю тебя" ("I WANT YOU"). At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects his or her coach if more than one coach expresses interest.

Battles
In the Battle Rounds, each coach groups three of his or her team members to perform together then chooses one to advance in the competition.

Sing-offs
In the Sing-off Rounds, five artists within a team sing individual performances in succession. The artists get to sing their "Blind Auditions" songs in this round. At the conclusion of the performances, coaches would decide which two of five artists get to advance to the next round.

Life Playoffs
But as with season 2, each coach bring back three artists who were eliminated in the Sing-offs. These artists advance to the special stage – "Live Playoffs". Three artists from each team sing live and two of them eliminate by the end of the night. One saved by the Public's vote artist advances to the Final in each team.

Final
In the Final of the competition, 6 artists from all teams (9 artists since season 2) perform in the live show, where public voting narrows to a final group of three artists from all teams and eventually declares a winner.

Addition
Since season 6, alongside the determining of the winner, television viewers vote for the Best coach using The Voice Kids App and HbbTV option in their TV sets.
