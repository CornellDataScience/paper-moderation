== Composition ==


=== Musical style ===
Critics compared the album's "austere" style to that of Ndegeocello's third album, Bitter (1999). Writing for Launch, critic Dan Leroy described the album as "spare, dub-influenced soul". Music journalist Jess Mayhugh termed the album's style "reggae soul". A review in Uncut called it Ndegeocello's Let's Get It On and noted the influence of both Ndegeocello's previous work and earlier Black musicians on the album. The album also drew comparison to Imagination's Body Talk (1981).
"Come Smoke My Herb" and "Fellowship" include "reggae-infused sounds". "Body" features half-whispered vocals and keyboards similar to those of Stevie Wonder. Multiple critics compared the guitars on "Liliquoi Moon" to those of Prince. Uncut referred to "Love Song #3" as a "narcotised Prince ballad". "Good Intentions", which features few lyrics, incorporates funk influences and discusses Ndegeocello's devotion to someone.
