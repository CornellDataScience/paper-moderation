== Construction and career ==
The ship was constructed by Lockheed Shipbuilding & Engineering Company at Seattle, Washington for the Bankers Trust Company and was launched on 22 August 1972. Named Sugar Islander, the vessel was completed in August 1973 and registered in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1995, the ship was acquired by Islander Shipholding and renamed Islander, before they changed it to Judy Litrico the following year. In 1998, Judy Litrico was acquired by US United Ocean Services LLC. They renamed the ship Tina Litrico in 2006. When purchased by the Lower Lakes Towing Company in 2011, it was renamed Tecumseh and re-registered at Port Dover, Ontario. The ship underwent a refit at Veracruz, Mexico before sailing to the Great Lakes. Tecumseh arrived at Montreal, Quebec on 29 December 2011 where it was fitted with Port Colborne fairleads from the scrapped Canadian Leader. Since entering service on the Great Lakes, the bulk carrier is primarily used to transport grains.
On 15 December 2019, the 16 crewmembers aboard Tecumseh were taken off the ship after a fire broke out in the engine room. The ship had been travelling from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Ontario to Windsor, Ontario carrying a load of canola. The United States Coast Guard responded to the fire, which happened off Zug Island in the Detroit River, on the United States side. The vessel, out of control, then drifted over to the Canadian side of the river. The ship was anchored on the Canadian side near Windsor.
On 29 July 2023, it was announced that Tecumseh was going to be scrapped in Port Colborne, Ontario after being laid up in Ashtabula since 2020.
