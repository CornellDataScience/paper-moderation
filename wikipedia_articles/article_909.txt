Mark Dvorzhetski (Hebrew: מרק דבורז'צקי; 3 May 1908 – 15 March 1975) was an Israeli physician, historian and Holocaust survivor.


== Biography ==
Mark Dvortzhetski was born in Vilnius (Vilna), Lithuania (at the time part of the Russian Empire). He received his education in Vilnius (Polish: Wilno) during the interwar period, when the city was part of the Second Polish Republic. He completed a medical degree there in 1935, and received a rabbinical diploma in 1938.
At the beginning of the Second World War, in September 1939, Dvorzhetski was drafted into the Polish army as a medical officer. After being taken prisoner by the Germans, he escaped and returned to Vilna. 
Under the German occupation of the city, he lived in the Vilna Ghetto (established in September 1941), working in the Jewish hospital. In September 1943 he was deported with other physicians to forced labor in Estonia; his wife, Miriam, and his sister, who volunteered to go with him, perished on the journey there. He worked in the Vaivara concentration camp in Estonia until the fall 1944, when he was transferred to concentration camps in Germany. In 1945 during a death march toward Dachau, he managed to escape into the forest with other Jewish internees, and was subsequently liberated by the French army.
After the war, Dvorzhetski lived in Paris, before immigrating  to Israel, in November 1949.
He authored a number of books on the Holocaust, in particular with reference to the Baltic States and the medical profession.
