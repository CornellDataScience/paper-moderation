The Pfuel family, also known as Pfuhl or Phull, is an ancient German noble family with a history that traces back to the year 926 when they first arrived in Brandenburg with King Henry the Fowler, who started governing the region in 928–929, allowing Emperor Otto I to establish the Northern March in 936 during the German Ostsiedlung. Over the centuries, the Pfuel extended their influence across various regions including Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, Württemberg, Westphalia, Eastern Europe, and Sweden.
The Pfuel family is one of the oldest and most venerable families in Brandenburg-Prussian history and has made significant marks in German and European history. They were among the families with the largest holdings and incomes in the Margraviate of Brandenburg.  Their lineage includes several influential figures who played key roles in military, governance, and political reforms, including a Prussian Minister of War and Prime Minister of Prussia. Twenty-five of them served as generals. Having acquired sixteen military medals Pour le Mérite - the highest award for bravery that could be awarded in the Kingdom of Prussia, they are the second highest decorated family.

The Pfuels came to the March so early, that as early as 1603, in a funeral sermon given at the death of one of their own, they could be described not only as an 'excellent' but also as an 'ancient family'. A lineage from which 'equestris et literati ordinis viri', brave war shields and well-learned, intelligent and tried men, emerged.
Members of the family held the title of Count. Today, they bear the name Counts Bruges-von Pfuel.
