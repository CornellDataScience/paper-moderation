V830 Tauri is a T Tauri star located 425.2 light-years (130.4 pc) away from the Sun in the constellation Taurus. This star is very young, with an age of only 2 million years, compared to the Sun's age, which is 4.6 billion years. Typical for a young stars, it exhibits strong flare activity, with three flares detected during a 91-day observation period in 2016.


== Characteristics ==
V830 Tauri is an M-type star. The star has a mass of roughly 1 solar mass, but has a radius of 2 solar radii, due to the star's age, which means that it hasn't fully contracted yet to become a main-sequence star. (It will likely be on the main sequence portion of its lifetime for about 10 billion years, much like the Sun.) It has a surface temperature of 4,250 K. For comparison, the Sun's surface temperature is 5,772 K.
V830 Tauri is a weak-lined T Tauri star, a pre-main sequence star that has a surrounding disc producing emission lines in its spectrum. It is also classified as a BY Draconis variable, cool stars with starspots and chromospheric activity that vary in brightness as they rotate. The variable period of 2.74 days matches the rotation period.


== Planetary system ==

On June 20, 2016, an exoplanet was found around V830 Tauri via radial velocity. It is one of, if not the youngest exoplanet ever found, with an age of only about 2 million years. The exoplanet has a mass of about 0.77 masses of Jupiter and is orbiting 0.057 AU away from its host star with a period of 4.93 d and an inclination of 55Â°. However, a 2020 study was unable to confirm this planet.
V830 Tauri b orbits its parent star every 4.93 days at a distance of 0.057 AU from its parent star. This is about 7x closer to the host star than the planet Mercury is to the Sun. Its mass is about 70% that of Jupiter, and, because it is orbiting very close to its parent star, it is classified as a hot Jupiter.
Previously, before the discovery of V830 Tauri b (and a slightly older planet named K2-33b, with an age around 5-10 million years), TW Hya b was discovered and disproven and PTFO 8-8695 b / CVSO 30 b was discovered with an age equally young and an orbit even closer. The yet unconfirmed objects are pending confirmation. The discovery of V830 Tauri b, K2-33b and PTFO 8-8695 b / CVSO 30 b suggests that the formation and migration of close-in giant planets can occur on a timescale of only a few million years. The new discoveries support planet-disc interactions as the most likely mechanism for efficiently producing young hot Jupiters.
