Joel Smallbone shared the story behind the song, saying: A year and a half ago, Luke [Smallbone] came into the studio and shared a personal story. That personal story ended up becoming this song. He had heard the minister speak about the meaning of baptism and Luke felt compelled to make that statement once again as an adult. There was a tangible moment as he rose out of the water where time stood still, and a new day had begun. This story of death to life became our song, "Amen."
