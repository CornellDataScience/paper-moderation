==== Deluxe edition singles ====
"Busy Child (Sta Remix)" is the first and only one of two official singles released from Vegas (Deluxe Edition). This is one of the better-known remixes from the album. After the release of Vegas (Deluxe Edition), the Crystal Method posted it on their Myspace page, and it remains there today. The single was released on August 28, 2007.
"High Roller (Myagi Remix)" is another popular remix from Vegas (Deluxe Edition). Despite its popularity, it has not been released as a single. The song is known for being used in the trailer for the movie Push. On an internet poll in early 2009, people were asked which of the remixes from Vegas was their favorite. "High Roller (Myagi Remix)" won by a landslide. On the same site that conducted the poll (http://www.thecrystalmethod.org), a contest was set up to ask questions to Myagi himself by the public. He would choose what he thought were the best questions and use those in the interview. People selected could get a chance to get special prizes, like an autographed copy of Myagi's recent album, 3 Years of Sunrise. Even people who submitted questions were put into a drawing for prizes. "High Roller (Myagi Remix)" was also the only other remix from Vegas (Deluxe Edition) to be put on the band's Myspace page after the release of the album, besides "Busy Child (Sta Remix)". Like "Busy Child (Sta Remix)", the song "High Roller (Myagi Remix)" remains on the band's Myspace today.
"Cherry Twist (deadmau5 Remix)" is the second official remix single released from Vegas (Deluxe Edition), remixed by deadmau5.
