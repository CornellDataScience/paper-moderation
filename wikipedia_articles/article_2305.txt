== Early life and education ==
Dunn is originally from Southern California. Assigned female at birth, Dunn had experienced challenges related to gender identity throughout adolescence. As an 18-year-old undergraduate student, Dunn discovered that the term "transgender" provided a framework for understanding his experiences. After encountering a lack of awareness about transgender and gender-nonconforming identities among faculty and staff, Dunn conducted research on these topics and began lecturing in various university courses. His advocacy expanded to launching a Safe Zone project, leading the campus Gay-Straight Alliance, and collaborating with statewide student advocacy groups. During this time, Dunn also experienced difficulty accessing trans-competent healthcare resources, including mental health support and treatment for severe endometriosis, which became life-threatening after he was repeatedly denied a hysterectomy.
Dunn eventually relocated to New England and attended the University of New Hampshire (UNH) School of Law, graduating in 2012 with his JD. At UNH, Dunn was part of the Daniel Webster Scholar Honors Program, which provided practical legal training, and completed internships with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire Human Rights Commission. Dunn is a licensed attorney and a member of the New Hampshire Bar Association.

In 2018, Dunn co-chaired the “Yes on 3” campaign, which successfully defended MA's trans-inclusive public accommodations law through a statewide referendum in the nation's first ever statewide vote on transgender rights. Following this, he joined Keshet in 2019 as the organization’s first Director of Advocacy, focusing on intersectional LGBTQ+ rights within the Jewish community. From 2020-2023, Dunn served as the Deputy Director of the Division of Education and Training at Fenway Health's National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center.
