Banthia was a part of the Mumbai Metro fare fixation committee, formed to resolve a dispute over metro fare between the government and its private partner in the project - MMOPL. Other members of the committee included Retired Justice E Padmanabhan and former law secretary T K Vishwanathan. While the other two members supported price hike, Banthia issued a dissent note, citing the following: "...the existing rules to guide the FFC to enable it to fix the fare... have not been clearly spelt out so far, specially for a PPP project. This has proved to be a major challenge and constraint for the FFC. It is suggested that this aspect be dealt (with) by Government of India, at the earliest, specially for PPP metro projects, since affordability and reasonability of fare structure will be the essence for the common public at large (sic),"   "The very applicability of the provisions of Fare Fixation in this case did not arise, since it was a PPP project, whose pre-bid parameters were already decided and frozen in terms of fare structure and service levelsâ€¦ This action, however, does not alter the BASIC and FUNDAMENTAL NATURE of the PARAMETERS, which were conditions precedent to the bidding process and inherent part of the bid document for the proposed execution of the Mumbai Metro Project. (sic)."
The price hike was later on felled by the Bombay High Court, leading to a challenge to the judgement in the Supreme Court by MMOPL. However, the Supreme Court referred the matter back to the High Court for taking it up for final hearing.
