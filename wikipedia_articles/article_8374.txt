After starting the season unranked, Michigan won its first seven games, including victories on the road against Wisconsin and Nebraska. On October 30, Michigan (ranked No. 6) lost to Michigan State (ranked No. 8).

== Preseason ==


=== Firing of Don Brown ===
On December 22, 2020, Michigan fired defensive coordinator Don Brown. Brown had taken over as defensive coordinator in 2016 and led the 2016 squad to a No. 1 national ranking.


=== Harbaugh's extension ===
On January 8, 2021, head coach Jim Harbaugh signed a four-year contract extension with Michigan, continuing through the 2025 season. The extension reduced Harbaugh's $8-million base salary to $4 million for the 2021 season but added incentive bonuses of $500,000 for winning the Big Ten East, $1 million for winning the Big Ten championship, $500,000 for reaching the College Football Playoff semifinal, $1 million for winning the College Football Playoff, $75,000 for winning National Coach of the Year honors, and $50,000 for winning Big Ten Coach of the Year honors. The new agreement also lowered the buyout that the university would be required to pay if it fired him before the end of the contract.


=== Coaching changes ===
Following his four-year extension, Harbaugh led a major overhaul of the Michigan coaching staff. The overhaul shifted away from older coaches (Don Brown was 65, Ed Warinner was 59) to younger with 10 assistants under age 40. The moves included the following:

On January 13, Michigan hired 34-year-old Mike Hart as running backs coach. Hart played for Michigan from 2004 to 2007 and set Michigan's career record with 5,040 rushing yards. He had been the running backs coach at Indiana since 2017 and associate head coach in 2020.
On January 17, Michigan hired 33-year-old Mike Macdonald as defensive coordinator. Macdonald was hired based on the recommendation of coach Harbaugh's brother, John Harbaugh. Macdonald spent the previous seven seasons as an assistant coach on John Harbaugh's staff with the Baltimore Ravens.
On January 19, Michigan hired 34-year-old George Helow, who had been Maryland's special teams coordinator and inside linebackers coach. Helow was initially assigned to coach safeties but was reassigned to linebackers.
On January 20, Michigan hired 36-year-old Maurice Linguist as defensive backs coach and co-defensive coordinator, but he left three months later to become head coach at Buffalo.
On January 25, Michigan hired 39-year-old Ronald Bellamy as the wide receivers coach (later switched to safeties). Bellamy was a wide receiver at Michigan from 1999 to 2002 and, prior to the hiring, was the head football coach at West Bloomfield High School.
Also on January 25, Michigan announced several other moves. Sherrone Moore (age 34) moved from tight ends coach to offensive line coach and co-offensive coordinator. Jay Harbaugh (age 31) moved from running backs to tight ends and special teams.
In February, offensive line coach Ed Warinner (age 59) left Michigan for Florida Atlantic.
Also in February, Brian Jean-Mary left Michigan to become the linebackers coach at Tennessee.
On February 22, Michigan hired Baltimore Ravens running backs coach Matt Weiss (age 37) as the new quarterbacks coach.
In May 2021, Michigan hired Kentucky assistant coach Steve Clinkscale (age 42) to become the defensive backs coach and defensive passing game coordinator.
Offensive coordinator Josh Gattis (age 38) and defensive line coach Shaun Nua (age 40) were the only two assistants who remained in their prior positions.

Hassan Haskins rushed for 169 yards, his sixth game of the year with over 100 yards rushing. Haskins' five rushing touchdowns against the Buckeyes was the most by any running back in the rivalry's history. The performance took him to a team-leading 18 touchdowns on the season and tied him for second in program history for single-season rushing touchdowns with Anthony Thomas and Chris Perry.
