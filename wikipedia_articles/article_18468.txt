Erik Lorig (born November 17, 1986) is a former American football fullback who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL).
He played defensive end and occasionally tight end in college football at Stanford.  He was selected by the Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL draft, converted to fullback in his rookie season, and played for the team for four years. His rookie contract was for four years with incentive escalators. In March 2014, the Saints signed Lorig in free agency to a four-year contract.


== Early life ==
Lorig was born in Rolling Hills, California. He is of German and Scandinavian descent.
He played high school football as a tight end and linebacker at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School in California. He was named the All-Bay Conference Defensive Player of the Year both his junior and senior years. He received Cal-Hi Sports, Parade Magazine, PrepStar and SuperPrep All-America honors as a senior.


== College career ==
He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal at defensive end. At 6-foot-4, 280 pounds, he ran the 40-yard (37 m) dash in 4.76 seconds, and was known for having a quick burst off the line. Lorig did not work out while at the combine due to injury. In his first two years at Stanford, Lorig played tight end and wore number 80. In his freshman campaign, Lorig played in all 12 games where he contributed on special teams and served as the offense's blocking TE, often lining up in the backfield as an H-back/fullback. He recorded 10 catches for 100 yards.
He was then asked by the new coaching staff to switch to defensive end for his junior year, and proceeded to record 39 tackles, including 6 tackles for loss and 3 sacks in 2008, and had 37 tackles, 7.5 tackles for loss and 2 sacks in 2007. His NFL prospect status took a severe hit in 2009, when he sat out most of the season because of a torn pectoral muscle.
In his five years at Stanford he started 25 of 29 games, and had 95 tackles, 16.5 tackles for a loss, and 4.5 sacks, earning Honorable Mention All-Pac 10 as a junior, and All-Pac All-Academic team twice (2008, 2009).
As an undergraduate at Stanford, Lorig majored in Public Policy, a sub-department within the School of Economics, with an emphasis in Technology Policy, and minored in Film and Media Studies. As part of the team's approach to academics as well as sports, the players' GPAs were posted in the locker room, along with their weight lifting results. He obtained a master's degree in Digital Media Technologies at Stanford in 2011, taking classes during his off-seasons.
