The Greek reality show version of Dancing with the Stars returned for its fourth season on October 20, 2013 from ANT1 TV channel. The show is based on the United Kingdom BBC Television series Strictly Come Dancing and is part of BBC Worldwide's Dancing with the Stars franchise. The theme song is "It's personal" performed by Swedish indie pop band The Radio Dept.
The host of this season was Doukissa Nomikou while on the backstage was the season three winner, Ntoretta Papadimitriou.
Giannis Latsios, Alexis Kostalas, Galena Velikova and Katia Dandoulaki returned as the judges of the show.
Of the celebrities that competed, 8 were female and 6 were male. The competitors were as follows: Chrispa, Katerina Stikoudi, Klelia Pantazi, Konstantina, Mary Synatsaki, Gogo Mastrokosta, Evagelia Aravani, Eleni Chatzidou, Lakis Gavalas, Michalis Mouroutsos, Thanos Kallioras, Sakis Arseniou, Isaias Matiamba and Alex Kavdas. Their professional partners were revealed on October 17, 2013.
On November 16, 2013, it was announced that on week 4, Giorgos Liagkas would make a guest appearance on the show and would be the fifth judge for the night. On week 8 Eugenia Manolidou, who competed in the first season of the show and got third place, was the second guest judge of the season. On week 9 the show had its third guest judge, Themos Anastasiadis. The three guests gave a score to the contestants but their score was symbolic and didn't count for the final result of that week.
On week 7, the couples were free to choose a favorite song of theirs to dance to and the routine was Freestyle.
At the end of the show of week 12, it was announced to the couples that they were going to dance to a trio challenge for their second dance the upcoming week. The third partner would be one of the previous stars of the season who got eliminated or a star from previous seasons of the show. From season 4, Aravani and Kavdas came back, while Elias Vrettos and Laura Narjes from season 3 also came back to dance with two of the couples. Vrettos and Narjes finished on second and third place of season 3 respectively.
On week 14, the stars for their second dance were challenged to dance a solo whole choreography without their pro partners.
This season lasted for 15 weeks due to one week with no elimination. It's the first season to last that long. For the final week, the audience was able to vote during the whole week and the winner was decided only by the public vote. Judges' scores did not count for the final result.
