Lorraine Adams graduated magna cum laude with an A.B. in English from Princeton University in 1981 after completing a 76-page-long senior thesis titled "The Hero in Ezra Pound's Cantos." She then attended Columbia University, graduating with an M.A. in English and American Literature in 1982.


== Career ==

She regularly contributes to the New York Times Book Review, and is a fellow at the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.
Adams and Dan Malone of The Dallas Morning News shared the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting, citing "reporting that charged Texas police with extensive misconduct and abuses of power", including rights violations.


=== Novels ===
Her first novel was published in 2004, Harbor, featuring North African Arab stowaways. It won accolades including Los Angeles Times Award for First Fiction, Virginia Commonwealth University First Novelist Award, and Entertainment Weekly Best Novel of 2004, and it made the New York Times Best Books of 2004 list.
Her second novel, The Room and the Chair, was published in 2010 and details the life of an American fighter pilot. The German-language edition is Crash (ZÃ¼rich: Arche, 2011).
Amy Wilentz, reviewing The Room and the Chair in the Los Angeles Times, stated, "Lorraine Adams is a singular and important American writer. The Room and the Chair establishes this without question: It is remarkable for its ambitions and its achievements. It's a war novel, a reporter's novel and a psychological thriller. It encompasses the broadest outlines of our world. It is also Adams' second novel, and it is gutsier and throws a wider net than the topical and gorgeously written Harbor, her first. Both books are about U.S. involvement in the Middle East, about psychological and political blowback, about what happens when you wage a war and then suddenly it slaps you back, blindsides you."


== Personal life ==
Adams lives in Harlem, New York and is married to the novelist Richard Price.
