== Early life ==
Cojolum was born on 15 June 1990 and was raised in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, close to Mexico City, by his mother. He has two brothers, one of them, his elder brother, "forced" him to play American football. Despite initially not wanting to practice American football, Cojolum played in local teams since he was four years old and joined the youth club Mavericks, where he won six championships. Cojolum has stated that the neighborhood where he grew up was dangerous and that many people there ended up on drugs or crime, but thanks to his love for sport he managed to stay out of trouble.

Cojolum was offered a scholarship to play at the Universidad del Valle de México (UVM) joining the Linces UVM, where he played from 2010 to 2015. In 2013, Cojolum had surgery after suffering an injury in a match against Burros Blancos, missing the entire 2013 season.
