== Professional career ==


=== Cincinnati Bengals ===
Brewer was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the third round (66th overall) in the 2001 NFL draft. However shortly after being drafted by the Bengals, it was discovered that Brewer had a pack-a-day cigarette addiction. As a rookie in 2001, Brewer did not see any game action due to a pulled groin. Brewer sat out of the May 2002 mini-camp and voluntary workouts due to a slightly torn hamstring. He returned to practice on May 21, 2002.
The Bengals promoted Brewer to be the number-one tight end after waiving Tony McGee. Brewer was competing with Reggie Kelly, Matt Schobel, and Tony Stewart for the starting tight end position.  Despite suffering from a bruised kneecap, Brewer played in the first three games of the 2002 season. In Week 3 on September 22, Brewer sprained his left knee. Projected to be out for 3 to 4 weeks,  Brewer had knee surgery on October 28, 2002, and was placed on injured reserve one week later. After battling with Schobel for the starting job once again in 2003, he was waived on August 31, 2003.
