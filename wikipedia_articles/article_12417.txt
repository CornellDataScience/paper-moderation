After attending parochial schools in Evansville and St. Louis, Missouri, Emmanuel Ledvina returned to Indiana and entered St. Meinrad's College in 1883. 
Ledvina was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Indianapolis by Bishop Silas Chatard on March 18, 1893.

From 1895 to 1907, he was pastor of St. Joseph's Parish in Princeton, Indiana. Ledvina became vice-president and general secretary of the Catholic Church Extension Society in 1907. He was later named a domestic prelate in 1918, and an honorary canon of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City in 1919.

On April 30, 1921, Ledvina was appointed the second bishop of the Diocese of Corpus Christi by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on June 14, 1921, from Bishop Joseph Chartrand, with Bishops Cornelius Van de Ven and Joseph Lynch serving as co-consecrators.
