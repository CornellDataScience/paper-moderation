Color key:


=== Week 1: Live Playoffs (April 11, 12 & 13) ===
The Live Playoffs comprised episodes 14, 15, and 16. 24 artists perform for a public vote; the top two artists per each team advances via public vote, while the bottom four artists compete for the coaches' save in the results show. The Monday night broadcast featured Teams Blake and Christina, the Tuesday night broadcast featured Teams Adam and Pharrell, and the Wednesday night broadcast featured the results. 


=== Week 2: Top 12 (April 18 & 19) ===
From weeks two to five, two artists with the fewest votes compete for an Instant Save, with one leaving the competition each week until the semifinals. iTunes bonus multipliers were awarded to Adam Wakefield (#7) and Alisan Porter (#9).


=== Week 3: Top 11 (April 25 & 26) ===
None of the artists reached the top 10 on iTunes, so no bonuses were awarded.


=== Week 4: Top 10 (May 2 & 3) ===
iTunes bonus multiplier was awarded to Porter (#6).


=== Week 5: Top 9 (May 9 & 10) ===
iTunes bonus multipliers were awarded to Wakefield (#9) and Laith Al-Saadi (#10). This week's Instant Save was the second closest in the show's history, with Paxton and Nick tied for most of the voting window; Paxton was saved with a difference of nearly 100 votes.


=== Week 6: Semifinals (May 16 & 17) ===
Four artists were eliminated on the semifinals. During the results, the top three artists with the most votes were immediately advanced the finals, the bottom two artists with the fewest votes were eliminated immediately, and the middle three artists were eligible for the Instant Save. In addition to their individual songs, each artist performed a duet with another artist in the competition, though these duets were not available for purchase on iTunes. iTunes bonus multipliers were awarded to Wakefield (#2), Porter (#3), Hannah Huston (#5), Mary Sarah (#6), Bryan Bautista (#7) and Al-Saadi (#10). All four coaches had an artist advance to the finals for the first time ever since season 1 and season 2 (which was team-based rather than individual), thus becoming the first season in The Voice history to achieve this distinction organically. Pink served as a mentor for the semifinalists on all four teams.


=== Week 7: Finale (May 23 & 24) ===
The Top four performed on Monday, May 23, 2016, with the final results following on Tuesday, May 24, 2016. Finalists performed a solo song, a duet with their coach, and an original song. In a change from the previous seasons, iTunes bonus multipliers were extended to songs performed in the final performance show. iTunes bonus multipliers were awarded to Wakefield (#1 and #9), Huston (#3 and #7), Porter (#4 and #5) and Al-Saadi (#6). All iTunes votes received for the six weeks leading up to the finale were cumulatively added to online and app finale votes for each finalist.

^  Originally, Owen Danoff was among the artists recruited by Al-Saadi for his performance prior to Danoff's absence.

== Controversy and criticism ==
The show faced controversy when Katherine Ho, a contestant on Team Adam, was the second contestant in the history of the show to make it to the third round of the competition and have all of her performances, including her Blind Audition, Battle, and Knockout round, montaged (not shown in full).
According to Matt Carter, "It's not often that we write an article on 'The Voice' that is about a contestant being triple-montaged, mostly because it is such a rare phenomenon, but here we are with it happening to Katherine Ho. When it a triple-montage does happen, it just makes it all the more frustrating since it eliminates the purpose of the show. We know that there is no guarantee that you are going to get airtime when you audition for the show, but we do think for the most part you should get a little more attention than Katherine Ho got over the course of the competition. Her Battle Round performance of Caroline Burns was not really shown, and this puts her in a similar camp with Rebekah Samarin back in season 7 of the show. They made it far enough on the show that they cannot audition again, and yet they don't really get a lot of publicity â€“ it's pretty unfair.
Here's the most egregious thing about this performance tonight: We don't even know what Katherine sang! She just didn't get any attention at all."
