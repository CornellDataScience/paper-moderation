The 2016–17 Copa del Rey was the 115th staging of the Copa del Rey (including two seasons where two rival editions were played).
Barcelona were the two-time defending champions, and successfully defended their title following a 3–1 win over Alavés in the final.
As winners, Barcelona would have been assured a place for the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League group stage; however, since they already qualified for the Champions League by finishing 2nd in La Liga, the berth was instead passed down the league. Times up to 29 October 2016 and from 26 March 2017 are CEST (UTC+2). Times from 30 October 2016 to 25 March 2017 are CET (UTC+1).
