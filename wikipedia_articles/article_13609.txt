Jens Nilssøn (in Latin Joannis Nicolai) (1538–1600) was a Norwegian clergyman, educator, poet and author. He served as the Bishop of Oslo from 1580 to 1600.


== Biography ==
Nilssøn was born in Oslo, Norway. After the death of his father, his mother moved to Denmark. He went to school in Copenhagen and Roskilde. He became Rector at Oslo Cathedral School in 1563. He was one of the Oslohumanisterne, a group of men associated with St. Hallvard's Cathedral and Oslo Cathedral School. Through their scholarly studies, they represented a breakthrough of humanism in Norway. He took his  Master's Degree from the University of Copenhagen in 1571. He served as an assistant and aide to  Bishop Frants Berg and in 1564  he married the bishop's daughter Magdalena (1546-1583).  When Bishop  Berg retired in 1580, Jens Nilsson succeeded him  in the bishopric.
As Bishop, he oversaw the completion of the Reformation in his diocese. He published several books in Latin and Danish and corresponded with other leading personalities of the time in Denmark-Norway, among them Tycho Brahe. Due to his prolific writing, he is the Norwegian person who lived before 1600 who is best known today. He is known for his visitation books, which paint a unique picture of Norway in the 16th century. He also wrote poetry in Latin, was interested in natural sciences, particularly astronomy, and had a passion for Norwegian prehistory. He preserved several medieval manuscripts, including Jǫfraskinna, which included parts of Heimskringla.
