The Hanriot HD.32 was a military trainer aircraft built in France in the 1920s. Derived from the HD.14 and sharing the same basic configuration as it, the HD.32 was a substantially revised design, with redesigned tailplane, undercarriage, and wings of shorter span. The HD.14's wooden construction was replaced in part with metal structure.
The HD.32 was Hanriot's entry in a 1924 Aéronautique Militaire competition to select a new trainer, and as the winner, was ordered in quantity as the HD.32 EP.2. The type HD.320 was also built in Yugoslavia by Zmaj aircraft in Zemun,  using a Salmson 9Ac, Siemens Sh12 or Walter NZ-120, engine.
In 1927, the Paraguayan Military Aviation School received three HD.32 which received the serials E.1, E.2 and E.3 (E meaning Escuela, School). They were supplemented by five Fleet 2 trainers in 1931, but remained in use until the end of the Chaco War, when they were retired.
