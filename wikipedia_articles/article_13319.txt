The 26th Legislative Assembly of Quebec was the political provincial legislature in Quebec, Canada that was elected in the 1960 Quebec general election.  It sat from 20 September 1960 to 22 September 1960, from 10 November 1960 to 10 June 1961, and from 9 January 1962 to 19 September 1962.  The Quebec Liberal Party led by Jean Lesage began the Quiet Revolution reforms. The Union Nationale, which had previously governed for more than 15 years, formed the official opposition under successive interim leaders Yves Prévost and Antonio Talbot, and then under Daniel Johnson, Sr. The Legislature lasted only two years as Lesage called the 1962 election as a referendum for the nationalization of hydroelectricity under Hydro-Québec.
