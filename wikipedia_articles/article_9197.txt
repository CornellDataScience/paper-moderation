Raghu, a young man from a village, spends his days roaming with his friends, teasing girls in the area. One day, a new resident, Karuna, arrives in the village. Raghu and his friends initially make mischief with her, but upon discovering that she is the sister of the feared David, they become wary of her. Raghu’s mother, a classical music teacher, begins instructing Karuna, who wishes to learn classical singing. Over time, Raghu and Karuna fall in love.
However, their relationship faces opposition due to religious and social differences. Karuna is a Christian, while Raghu is a Hindu. Additionally, David, Karuna’s brother, is a feared figure in the village and may act violently if he discovers their love. Despite the societal and familial disapproval, Raghu and Karuna continue their relationship. Eventually, they decide to leave the village, choosing to escape the constraints of their community and pursue their love freely, akin to butterflies, symbolizing their desire for freedom, as reflected in the film’s title, Seethakoka Chilaka.
