The Robin R 3000 is a French single-engined light aircraft designed and built by Avions Robin, which entered production in the 1980s.


== Development and design ==
In 1978, Avions Robin started design of a new range of all-metal single-engined light aircraft, with a wide range of variants planned with between two and four seats, various engines and a choice of fixed or retractable undercarriage.  The first prototype, a R.3140, a four-seater powered by a Lycoming O-320 flew on 8 December 1980, with the second prototype flying on 2 June 1981. 
The R.3140 is a single-engined, low-wing monoplane with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage. Its wings have a similar planform to the earlier wooden Robins such as the DR400, with tapered outer wing sections. But unlike the cranked wings of these earlier aircraft, the wings of the R.3140 have constant dihedral. A forward sliding canopy covers a four-seat cockpit, while the aircraft is fitted with a distinctive T-tail.


== Operational history ==
In 1983, a marketing agreement was reached between Avions Robin and SOCATA, the light aircraft subsidiary of Aérospatiale to market the R 3000 series.  This led to the planned higher power versions being abandoned, with engines limited to 119 kW (160 hp) or less to avoid competition with Socata's own TB series. The R.3140 received its type certificate on 13 October 1983.
32 had been built by the start of 1988, when the marketing agreement with SOCATA was stopped. Production continued after Robin was sold to Aéronautique Service  (later to become Apex Aircraft) in mid-1988, with 76 delivered by 1998.
