== History ==
Scholastica was founded  in 1977, in an effort to meet the demands for schools having English as the medium of instruction, but emphasising equal proficiency in Bengali. At the time of its founding, the school comprised a single campus for junior-level students (grades PG to Class 2) in Dhanmondi. Since then, the school has expanded to six campuses: four for junior-level students, and two senior-level campuses, both the Mirpur and Uttara campuses are now considered the school's main campus.


== Curriculum ==
Scholastica offers a complete primary, elementary, secondary and high school program leading to the General Certificate of Education examinations which are conducted by the British Council in Dhaka.
Since the 2008–09 academic session, the school's O and A Level examinations have been administered by Cambridge Assessment International Education, replacing the Edexcel system of schooling.


=== Laboratory ===
Laboratory facilities are provided for all the science classes. The senior laboratories are inspected and approved by the representatives of the University of London to meet its standard for the practical requirement of the 'O' and 'A' Level examinations.


=== Extra-curricular activities ===
Scholastica extra-curricular activities include drama, debating and public speaking. The school also offers a large number of both teacher and student run clubs. School teams participate in inter-school and national competitions. Theatrical presentations are performed in English and Bengali, and it is well known for its annual dramas. Several after-school programs are offered beginning in middle school.
The school is also famous for its renowned Model United Nations conferences, known as "SCHOMUN" in its Uttara Branch which was also the first school affiliated Model UN conference in the country. The conference is managed by the school's Model UN club founded in 2015 with Shadman Shakib serving as the club's president during the 2015-2016 and 2016–2017 academic sessions.
