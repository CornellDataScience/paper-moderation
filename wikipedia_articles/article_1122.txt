Rossington Main Football Club is an English football club based in Rossington, Doncaster, South Yorkshire. They play in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division, at level 9 of the English football league system.


== History ==
The club came into existence in 1919 as Rossington Main Colliery, making their FA Cup debut in 1921. They competed in the FA Cup until the Second World War, reaching the 4th qualifying round in 1924, losing 0–3 to Lincoln City.
They played in local leagues such as the Doncaster & District Senior League and Sheffield Association League up to the 1970s (having changed their name to Rossington Miners Welfare in 1948), before entering the Yorkshire League in 1975. Their stay in this league lasted just five seasons, finishing in the lower echelons of Division Three on each occasion.
The club entered the Central Midlands League (CMFL) in 1983 after renaming themselves Rossington Main. They won the Premier Division title in 1985 and were promoted to the Supreme Division a year later. In 1991 they joined the Northern Counties East League (NCEL), entering Division One.
In 1998, the club amalgamated with Rossington F.C., who had been members of the CMFL (although never in the same division as Main). Although officially a merger, Main were the senior partner and their name and league placing was retained.
In 2022, Rossington Main had one of their most successful seasons since going division 1, finishing 5th in the league with 81 points from 40 games. They lost 2–0 in the first round of the playoffs to North Ferriby FC. The next season was their most successful, with the club finishing 3rd in the table and qualifying for the playoff where the Colliery defeated Horbury Town F.C. in the final. Rossington Main was promoted to the Premier Division for the first time in its history after more than 30 years in Division One.
