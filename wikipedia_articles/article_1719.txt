== Critical reception ==

Matt Collar of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, stating the album "showcases the duo's one-two punch style, which usually consists of Oller's resonant vocals backed by Kelly's playful raps. What could end up sounding gimmicky or contrived doesn't, as Kelly (who some may remember as Walt on Lost) and Oller reveal they have enough thoughtful irreverence and technical skill to keep things interesting." Melissa Redman of Renowned for Sound gave the album 4 out of 5 stars stating that "All songs contain a dynamic energy, and it's evident in the music that the duo had fun creating these tracks" and "MKTO's album delivers a great variety of songs."
