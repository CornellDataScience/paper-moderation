Latin Alliance is the studio album by a one-off collaboration of Chicano and Latin American rappers. The group was formed in 1989 and released their one and only album in 1991 via Virgin Records. It features performances by Kid Frost, A.L.T., Markski, Rayski Rockswell, Mellow Man Ace, Lyrical Engineer, Hip Hop Astronaut, and the Lyrical Latin, with guest appearances by War and Scoop DeVille. The recording sessions took place at Digital Sound & Picture in New York City, Skyline Recording in Topanga, Wide Tracks, Image Recorders, and Echo Sound in Los Angeles. The album was produced by Kid Frost, Tony G, Will Roc, Todd Alexander, Ralph Rivers, the Baka Boyz, Julio G, Geoff Rios, and Mike Greene.
The ten-track album peaked at No. 133 on the Billboard 200, at 83 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and at 18 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. It spawned two singles: "Lowrider (On the Boulevard)", a remake of War's hit single "Low Rider", and "Know What I'm Sayin'?". Its lead single, "Lowrider (On the Boulevard)", which was performed by Frost, A.L.T., Markski, Mellow Man Ace, and War, made it to number 15 on the Hot Rap Songs chart. Latin Alliance is regarded as one of the pioneering albums of Hispanic hip hop, being one of the first albums to be released by a group of Latino rappers.


== Critical reception ==

The St. Petersburg Times stated: "Using samples from such diverse sources as War, Herbie Hancock, the Dramatics and Bob James, the group constructs rhythm tracks rooted in funk and laced with Afro-Cuban touches (timbales, horns and the like)." Trouser Press said that the album "includes appealing rhymes about identity, undocumented aliens, community unity and social dangers."
