Anselm Stolz (November 25, 1900 – September 19, 1942) was a Benedictine monk, theologian, and professor.


== Biography ==
He entered Gerleve Abbey and made solemn profession on February 29, 1920. He attended the Pontifical Athenaeum of Saint Anselm beginning in 1921; he taught Systematic Theology there beginning in 1928. He spoke frequently at Catholic conferences such as the Hochschulwochen in Salzburg in 1937. He died in Rome in 1942, after contracting typhoid fever while caring for the sick. 


== Reception ==
Several theologians have identified his work as an important example of rediscovered, "authentically Christian mysticism." When Sant' Anselmo celebrated its centennial anniversary, the Faculty of Theology held a symposium in honor of Stolz, who was described as "one of its most famous lecturers" in the published proceedings.


== Christian Ascetism ==
His first publication on ascetism appeared in 1936, but it was the 1943 book on Christian spirituality that had long-standing success. It has been translated into the three languages over the course of eighty years. His references were primarily Church Fathers and the Rule of St. Benedict, occasionally referencing Thomas Aquinas. His approach was unusual in an era which had not yet re-discovered patristic sources.
