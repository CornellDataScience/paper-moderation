== History ==
Almond Fryer settled on the banks of the Upper Iowa River in section 14 of the township in 1855.  The name at the time of surveying was Lodi, but when the township was organized in February 1874 it was called "Belleview," as was the railroad station.  Lodi, Italy, the namesake of the township, is a town in Lombardy made famous by a battle that Napoleon fought there.  At the organizing meeting, the people of the township re-adopted the name Lodi and elected a moderator, a clerk, three judges of the election, a chairman, two supervisors, a treasurer, two justices of the peace, and two constables.  The current village of Taopi was started as a corporation in 1875.
