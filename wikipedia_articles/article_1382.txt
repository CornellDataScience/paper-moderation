The area is also good for firefly viewing. In June, there is a firefly festival, and fireflies can easily be seen from many of the "chinkabashi" (Low water crossing).

Wild boars, deer, tanuki, rabbits and monkeys are frequently seen in the area. Deer in particular are a pest to farmers, and can be seen on many of the roads at night.


== Education ==
Prior to April 2012, there were seven elementary schools, one junior high school, one high school and three nursery schools in the former village's area. However, due to falling student numbers, the elementary schools merged into one school, Nishitosa Elementary School, and one of the nursery schools closed. Currently, the junior high school, elementary school, and two nursery schools are visited regularly by one resident ALT, as part of the JET Programme. The high school is visited by a separate, privately contracted ALT.
