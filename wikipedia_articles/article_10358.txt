== Early career ==
Kellegher began in theatre, working in Galway in the late 1980s, where she played a variety of roles with the Druid Theatre Company. She also worked with the Abbey Theatre playing, among other roles, Nora Clitheroe in the highly acclaimed production of The Plough and the Stars, opposite Aidan Kelly in 2004.
In 1993 she landed a small role in the Jim Sheridan movie In the Name of the Father. Also in this year, she was cast in one of the roles for which she would become best known: Sharon Curley in Stephen Frears' 1993 film The Snapper. Playing the role of a young woman from a working-class Dublin family dealing with an unintended pregnancy opposite Colm Meaney, she won a British Comedy Award and a best actress award at the Valladolid International Film Festival. The film remains hugely popular in Ireland and was the seventh highest-rated Irish film on Rotten Tomatoes in 2018, a quarter of a century after its initial release. Following this success, she was cast in Scarlett, which was the most expensive TV miniseries ever made at the time.
In 1996, she joined the BBC television series Ballykissangel as Niamh Quigley, the role for which she is best known, for which she won an IFTA.

After Ballykissangel she mostly worked in theatre and took smaller roles in TV productions. She is also a well-known voice on BBC Radio 4, having played policewoman Tina Mahon in the first four series of Baldi.
