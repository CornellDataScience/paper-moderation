=== Secession movement ===
There has been an effort to separate into a local independent school district since 2008, culminating in a referendum in April 2015, which narrowly passed, asking the village to pursue the feasibility of a separation.
Before the referendum, Caledonia's state senator, Van H. Wanggaard suggested that changes could be made to state law which would enable Caledonia (and the village of Sturtevant, which also passed a referendum to pursue separation) to legally separate from the school district.  Instead, Wanggaard, along with State Representative Tom Weatherston, proposed that the school district should be divided into territorial districts, rather than electing all of its members to at-large seats.  That measure passed into law in Wisconsin's 2015 budget, and the districts adopted ensure that Caledonia and Sturtevant will each have at least one school board representative.  "I see this as a better solution than busting Unified up with Caledonia, Sturtevant and Mount Pleasant leaving it," Weatherston said.
However, the issue was not completely settled.  In 2017, the Republican state government passed, as part of the biennial budget, the Opportunity Schools and Partnership Program (OSPP).  Under the program, if a school district received a failing grade from the state for two consecutive years, a special commissioner would be appointed to draw a new district for the failing schools, and municipalities within the existing district would be empowered to hold a binding referendum on separation from the district.  There were no public hearings on the OSPP.
In 2017, however, Racine Unified School District received a passing grade, meaning that a referendum on separation would not be possible under the law until 2020 at the earliest.
In 2018, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and State Superintendent Tony Evers—who was also, at the time, the Democratic candidate for Governor of Wisconsin—recommended the full repeal of the Opportunity Schools and Partnership Program. Evers won the 2018 election and became the 46th Governor of Wisconsin.
