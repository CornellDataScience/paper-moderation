The 2023 Viterra Championship, Manitoba's provincial men's curling championship, was held from February 8 to 12 at the Yellowstone Community Recreation Centre in Neepawa, Manitoba. The winning Matt Dunstone rink represented Manitoba at the 2023 Tim Hortons Brier in London, Ontario where they finished with a silver medal after losing in the final to Team Canada 7–5. The only two losses in the Brier by the Dunstone rink came against Team Canada.
Despite losing in the final, the Reid Carruthers rink still qualified for the Brier as the Wild Card #2 representative based on CTRS standings, where they finished fifth in Pool A with a 4–4 record.
