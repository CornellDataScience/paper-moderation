Damxung is a county of Lhasa City, lying to the north of its main center of Chengguan, in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China. Its administrative seat is Damquka. The terrain is rugged, including the western Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains, with their highest peak rising to 7,111 metres (23,330 ft). 
As of 2013 the population was 40,000, with most of the people engaged in animal husbandry.


== History ==
Damxung means "select pasture" in the Tibetan language. The Damxung steppe was gifted by the 5th Dalai Lama to Güshi Khan during the latter's reign. A number of Mongol cavalry soldiers settled down in the area, who became known as Mongol Eight Banners of Dam. After Güshi Khan's death in 1679, the area was possessed by Ngakpa Tratsang of Sera Monastery. From 1715 to 1912, the former Mongol Eight Banners land was directly administered by the Qing Dynasty Amban. Following the Qing's collapse, the area once again came under possession of Sera Monastery, which established Damxung Dzong under Domê Chikyab (mdo smad spyi khyab, "Domê Governorate"), predecessor of the modern Chamdo Prefecture. In 1956, the county was transferred to Lhasa City. In 1959, Petsang and Yangbajain merged into Damxung to form the modern Damxung County.

== Monuments ==
Kangmar Monastery (康玛寺) is in Chonggar Village, Gungtang Township, Damxung County, 16 kilometres (10 mi) from the county seat.
The monastery belonged to the Gelug sect, and was administered by the Hardongkangcun of the Tantric School of Sera Monastery. 
As of 2003 it had 62 monks and was the largest monastery in Damxung. It was said to have been built by a monk from Kangma in Garze Prefecture. The meditation room has 1,213 carved stone reliefs of Buddha, mostly about 20 by 30 centimetres (8 by 12 in).
They are about three hundred years old.
The temple stands on a barren slope below a mountain, but the meeting room has electric light and heating.
The temple operates a tea house and a grocery store. The monks have built a two-story dormitory.
Yangpachen Monastery is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Yangbajain, historically the seat of the Shamarpas of Karma Kagyu.
It is the main monastery of the Red Hat school of the Karma Kagyu sect.
It was built in 1490, and through extensive repairs and additions grew into a major architectural complex that contained a large collection of cultural relics.
The Red Hat school of Karma Kagyu died out in 1791. The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but later was rebuilt.
The Eight Towers of Northern Tibet (藏北八塔) in Wumatang (Uma) townland are said to be the guardians of the grasslands of northern Tibet.
One story of their origin is that eight generals of King Gesar, who unified the grasslands of northern Tibet, were killed at this place and the towers were built to commemorate them. Another says that the eight generals of the Mongol army were killed here. This may be more plausible, since the names seem to have Mongol origins.
Namtso lake is the second-largest salt lake in China. It has vivid turquoise-blue waters and is set in spectacular scenery.
The Tashi Dor Monastery is at an elevation of 4,718 metres (15,479 ft) in the southeastern corner of the lake.
It is situated on the Tashi Dor promontory.
It is more a chapel than a monastery, with two small buildings holding images of local deities.
