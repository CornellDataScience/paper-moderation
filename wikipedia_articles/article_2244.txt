In mathematics, Lazard's universal ring is a ring introduced by Michel Lazard in Lazard (1955) over which the universal commutative one-dimensional formal group law is defined.
There is a universal commutative one-dimensional formal group law over a universal commutative ring defined as follows.  We let

  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)}
  

be

  
    
      
        x
        +
        y
        +
        
          ∑
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
        
          c
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        
          y
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x+y+\sum _{i,j}c_{i,j}x^{i}y^{j}}
  

for indeterminates 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{i,j}}
  
, and we define the universal ring R to be the commutative ring generated by the elements 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{i,j}}
  
, with the relations that are forced by the associativity and commutativity laws for formal group laws. More or less by definition, the ring R has the following universal property:

For every commutative ring S, one-dimensional formal group laws over S correspond to ring homomorphisms from R to S.
The commutative ring R constructed above is known as Lazard's universal ring. At first sight it seems to be incredibly complicated: the relations between its generators are very messy. However Lazard proved that it has a very simple structure: it is just a polynomial ring (over the integers) on generators of degree 1, 2, 3, ..., where 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{i,j}}
  
 has degree 
  
    
      
        (
        i
        +
        j
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (i+j-1)}
  
.  Daniel Quillen (1969) proved that the coefficient ring of complex cobordism is naturally isomorphic as a graded ring to Lazard's universal ring. Hence, topologists commonly regrade the Lazard ring so that 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{i,j}}
  
 has degree 
  
    
      
        2
        (
        i
        +
        j
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2(i+j-1)}
  
, because the coefficient ring of complex cobordism is evenly graded.
