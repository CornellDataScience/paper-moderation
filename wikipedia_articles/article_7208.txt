Graettinger got its start in the 1880s, following construction of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway through that territory. The land was originally owned by Dr. Alois Graettinger, a German physician who had immigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He gave the land to the railway under the condition that the town were to be named after him. Members of the Graettinger family still live in the town. They are descendants of Dr. Graettinger's brother, Blasius, who was a stone cutter by trade but moved to Iowa to farm.
Graettinger is the location of the oldest Labor Day celebration in the state of Iowa. Each year, the town celebrates with a parade, carnival, street dance, variety show, queen coronation, raffle drawing and various other events.
