Good Things is a music festival held in major cities around Australia.  It features a number of international and Australian music acts, from various genres including rock, metal, punk, and emo.


== History ==
In early-2018, music tour organiser Destroy All Lines announced a new music festival, Good Things. It would become the biggest music festival held in Australia since Soundwave in 2015. The Good Things festival debuted in Melbourne, before playing at Sydney and Brisbane. On 19 November, the New South Wales Police Force issued a statement addressing accusations that they "made it impossible" for the Good Things festival to operate as all-ages in Sydney by imposing "multiple impediments" and charging "exorbitant" policing fees. The next day Destroy All Lines announced that the Sydney festival would no longer be an all-ages event, and it would restricted to 18-and-over. Under-age ticket holders for the Sydney festival were later contacted and given full refunds.
Two weeks before the first festival, Destroy All Lines announced that under-aged ticket holders would have to be accompanied by a responsible adult at the Melbourne festival. The move was met with outrage as festival-goers and parents alike described it as 'unfair'. The Brisbane festival had no restrictions and was an all-ages event. At the Sydney show, during Tonight Alive's set a 46-year-old security guard died due to a suspected heart attack.
Good Things confirmed via their Facebook page that they would be back to host a 2019 festival. On 19 August 2019, organisers announced the dates and venues for Good Things 2019. The Sydney venue was changed to Centennial Park to accommodate more people.
The 2020 festival was cancelled due to the then-ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. Dates were announced for the 2021 festival for 3â€“5 December in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. However the 2021 festival was also cancelled from an outbreak of the then-recent COVID-19 Omicron variant. Dates and the planned lineup still stand for the 2022 festival, which was announced alongside the former's cancellation.
