== History ==

The station's original call sign, WAPA, was a partial abbreviation of the station's original owners, the now-defunct Asociación de Productores de Azúcar, or Puerto Rico Sugar Grower's Association. In the late 1960s, it was acquired by Hearst Corporation. In 1991, it was acquired by NotiRadio Broadcasting (Eng. Wifredo G. Blanco-Pi, owner and his son Eng. Jorge Blanco, news director).
In 1996, NotiRadio Broadcasting acquired radio station WISO 1260 in Ponce from South Puerto Rico Broadcasting Corporation (founded by Luis Freyre in 1953); this became the second radio station of the WAPA Radio News Network.
In 2014, after 66 years of local operation, WXRF 1590 AM in Guayama (originally founded by Jose Fuster) was acquired from International Broadcasting Corporation by NotiRadio Broadcasting for $100,000, as the third radio station of WAPA Radio. On March 24, this station changed its call letters to WGYA.
On March 14, 2017, after a year off the air due to transmitter problems, NotiRadio Broadcasting resumed operations of WVOZ 1580 AM in Morovis-Manatí, rejoining the WAPA Radio News Network, since its establishment, 35 years ago in 1981. The station was acquired from International Broadcasting Corporation for $150,000. WVOZ became silent due to technical maintenance and financial reasons in April 2016.
On March 2, 2017, WAPA Radio acquired WMIA 1070 AM in Arecibo (originally owned by Abacoa Radio Corporation) for over $250,000, and the sale was completed on April 14, 2017. On May 1, WMIA became the new "WAPA Radio News Network" station, serving the northern area.
WVOZ changed its community of license from Morovis to Aguadilla, after WI3XSO's license was cancelled on May 8. The community of license move was granted on December 28, 2017. WAPA Radio was now a network of five radio stations across the island.
On June 21, 2017, WTIL 1300 AM in Mayaguez buys for a three-way swap from La Mas Z Radio, Inc., when awaiting the transaction completes, this becomes the sixth radio station of the WAPA Radio News Network on August 1. On August 3, WGYA changed back to the original WXRF call letters. On August 15, the sale of WTIL to Blanco Pi was completed. 
WAPA was the only radio station to remain on the air throughout the passage of Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017. The station helped family members contact each other by relaying messages of safety. WAPA's programming was reduced to 17 and a half hours from 4:45 AM until 9 PM, operating with a diesel generator, that some areas of the transmitters don't have electrical grid. As of 2018, WAPA's programming was heard on weekdays from 4:45 AM to 10 PM, Saturdays from 5 AM to 10 PM and Sundays from 6 AM to 10 PM.
On May 23, 2022, after WAPA-TV acquired radio stations WKAQ (AM) and FM in San Juan, and in order to avoid confusion between unrelated broadcasting entities, branding for "WAPA Radio" was changed to "Borinquen Radio". The WBQN call letters that had been assigned to a station on 1160 AM in Barceloneta-Manatí were moved to the former WAPA at 680 AM in San Juan, and several other call sign changes were made around the network. Another call swap, on October 11, 2024, restored the WAPA call sign to the station.


=== Synchronous relay station ===
Until 2017, then-WAPA's programming was relayed through an experimental synchronous booster station that also transmitted on 680 kHz: WA2XPA in Arecibo, which was originally licensed September 26, 2003.
On November 7, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) stated that the license for WA2XPA would only be renewed for six months, after which the station would be deleted. The reason given was that the station had far exceeded the six-year maximum permitted for experimental authorizations. 
On April 19, 2017, the FCC confirmed its ruling that WA2XPA's license would not be renewed. The ruling stated that it must discontinue operation on May 7, 2017 and the license would be cancelled on May 8, 2017.
A petition for review of the cancellation order was submitted on April 24, 2017. The petition was withdrawn on September 5, 2017, and the license was cancelled on May 16, 2018.
