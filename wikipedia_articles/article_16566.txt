The Big T.N.T. Show is a 1965 concert film featuring performances by numerous popular rock and roll and R&B musicians from the United States and the United Kingdom.
A sequel to the T.A.M.I. Show (1964), the film was directed by Larry Peerce and produced by Phil Spector. It was distributed by American International Pictures.


== Filming ==
The film was shot before a live audience at the Moulin Rouge club at 6230 Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles on November 29 and November 30, 1965.
The Big T.N.T. Show was aimed at the teenage demographic and featured 3,000 teenagers in the audience. "T.N.T." was an acronym for Tune 'n' Talent. The film was a follow-up to the T.A.M.I. Show, which was released a year prior. "T.A.M.I." was an acronym for "Teenage Awards Music International."
The concert was shot on videotape and transferred to 35-millimeter film. Director Larry Peerce used four television cameras to record the performances. Record producer Phil Spector was the producer and musical director.
According to executive producer Henry G. Saperstein, 140 minutes of footage was shot, but the film was cut down to 90 minutes for the theatrical release. Each of the acts performed their set three times.
Its pre-release title was This Could Be the Nightâ€”The Big T.N.T Show. The film's theme song, "This Could Be the Night", was written by Harry Nilsson, produced by Phil Spector, and performed by the Modern Folk Quartet.
