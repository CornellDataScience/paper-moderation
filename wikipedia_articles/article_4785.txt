"Don't Give Up on Us" is a hit song recorded by American-British singer David Soul, and written by Tony Macaulay.


== Background ==
Riding high on the success of his role in the hit TV show Starsky and Hutch, Soul returned to singing, which had been one of his early career choices. His debut, the Tony Macaulay-written-and-produced song  was a worldwide smash, spending four weeks at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart in January and February 1977, and a single week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1977. In addition, the song spent one week at No. 1 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart.  It has sold 1.16 million copies in the UK.
Its B-side, "Black Bean Soup", with lyrics by actor Gardner McKay, is a duet with actress Lynne Marta, whom Soul was involved with at the time.
"Don't Give Up on Us" was rated No. 93 in VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders because, despite having more hits in the UK, Soul was never again able to reach the top 40 in the US.  Soul recorded a new version of the song in 2004, allegedly after being embarrassed when hearing it by chance in an elevator as sung by Owen Wilson in the film version of Starsky and Hutch. The film soundtrack included a cover of the song by Wilson and Neal Casal.
