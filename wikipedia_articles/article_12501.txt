Bjorn Mikhail Poonen (born July 27, 1968, in Boston, Massachusetts) is a mathematician, four-time Putnam Competition winner, and a Distinguished Professor in Science in the Department of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  
His research is primarily in arithmetic geometry, but he has occasionally published in other subjects such as probability and computer science.
He has edited two books.
He is the founding managing editor of the journal Algebra & Number Theory, and serves also on the editorial boards of Involve: A Journal of Mathematics and the A K Peters Research Notes in Mathematics book series.


== Education ==
Poonen is a 1985 alumnus of Winchester High School in Winchester, Massachusetts.  In 1989, Poonen graduated from Harvard University with an A.B. in Mathematics and Physics, summa cum laude. He then studied under Kenneth Alan Ribet at the University of California, Berkeley, completing a PhD there in 1994.


== Academic positions ==
Poonen held postdoctoral positions at Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and Princeton University and served on the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley from 1997 to 2008, before moving to MIT.
