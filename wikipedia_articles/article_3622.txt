The office of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation oversees all government regulations pertaining to civil aviation and the Aviation Act (Undang Undang Nomor 1 Tahun 2009 Tentang Penerbangan). Its headquarters is in Jakarta.


== History ==
History of avionics in Indonesia started in 1913, when J.W.E.R. Hilger started a demo flight in Surabaya using a Fokker-made Spin aircraft. The flight was failure, but the flyer, Hilger, survived from the crash.
First route of the Netherlands to Dutch East Indies opened on 1 October 1924, started from Schiphol Airport to Cililitan Airport (now Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport). On 1 November 1928, Koninklijke Nederlandsch-Indische Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KNILM) established as Dutch East Indies aviation company, supported with Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KLM) and Dutch East Indies government, and other Dutch companies operated in Dutch East Indies. On 1929, KLM started to operate scheduled flights across Dutch East Indies. 
For much of its existence, those companies operated flights and regulated civilian flights in Dutch East Indies until 25 December 1949, when a KLM representative, Dr. Konijnenburg, met Sukarno in Yogyakarta and relinquished KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf which was formed after KNILM dissolution in 1947, to Indonesian government as follow up of the Round Table Conference. While much of the KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf later transformed to Garuda Indonesia Airline, part of it transformed to civilian flight regulatory authority called Djawatan Penerbangan Sipil (Civil Aviation Service) in 1952. It later elevated to a directorate-level Directorate of Civil Aviation in 1963 within the Ministry of Transportation, and finally to Directorate General of Civil Aviation in 1969. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation experienced several times of structural expansion, with the current form of the structure being established in 1991.
To support the Directorate General work, a network of air navigational aid system, SENOPEN (Sentra Operasi Keselamatan Penerbangan, Air Safety Operation Center), opened in 1978 with 7 offices across Indonesia.
