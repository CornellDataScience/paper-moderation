== Critical reception ==
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film an approval rating of 93%, based on 56 reviews; the average rating is 7.7/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Premature transcends its familiar trappings with sharp dialogue and a strong sense of setting that further establish Rashaad Ernesto Green as a gifted filmmaker."
In a review for TheWrap, Candice Frederick stated, "The push and pull of Ayanna and Isaiah's relationship comes off naturally, thanks to Howard and Green's sensitive writing. That style carries over to Laura Valladao's equally raw cinematography, capturing the hot New York City summer from the almost dusty sidewalk pavements, to the fiery sunset over the park, and the intimacy of two vulnerable lovers in bed at night next to an open window." Jon Frosch wrote of Howard's performance in a review for The Hollywood Reporter, "What keeps you invested is Howard, who makes her proud, steely character's every moment of vulnerability feel like a gift to both the audience and to Isaiah, who may not be worthy of her. It's a performance that builds gradually in power and radiance."
