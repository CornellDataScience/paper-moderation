His father was Joaquim Lluhí i Rissech (1866–1926), a lawyer and founder of the Nationalist Republican Center and the Federal Union of Nationalist Republicans.
Joan Lluhí i Vallescà attended the Institute of Barcelona from 1910 to 1915 for his secondary education.

He became a lawyer and a Freemason.
In 1929 he founded and edited the journal L'Opinió.


== Second Spanish Republic (1931–36) ==
Lluhí was a founding member of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC, Republican Left of Catalonia).
He was elected deputy to the national legislature on 28 June 1931 for Barcelona.
Lluhí was also elected a member of the Catalan parliament.
He participated in drafting the 1932 Statute of Núria for Catalan autonomy.
He was Director of Public Works in the government of the Generalitat of Catalonia initiated on 3 October 1932. 
From 19 December 1932 he was also President of the Executive Council of the Generalitat.
He resigned in January 1933 because he could not agree with President Francesc Macià over the distribution of powers between the Executive Council and the President.
Lluhí was not included in the government initiated on 24 January 1933.
He left the Esquerra Republicana in October 1933 to found the Partit Nacionalista Republicà d’Esquerra, with the old followers of L'Opinió.
He later led this group back into the Esquerra.
He was appointed Director of Justice on 3 January 1934 in the first government of Lluís Companys.

Lluhí became Minister of Labor, Health and Social Assurance in the government of Santiago Casares Quiroga on 13 May 1936.
Catalonia had recently calmed down, and the appointment of Lluhí to the cabinet was expected to help reduce tensions in Spain as a whole.
It soon became clear he was not competent for the post.
In the days leading up to the outbreak of civil war in July 1936 he did not understand the growing danger.
