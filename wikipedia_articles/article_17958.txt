The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) is an initiative of the United States Department of State. It was started by President Barack Obama in 2010. YALI is a programme aimed at educating and networking young African leaders with activities including the Mandela Washington Fellowship that brings them to study in the United States for six weeks with follow-up resources and student exchange programs. In 2014, the program was expanded to include four regional "leadership centers" in Ghana, Kenya, Senegal and South Africa.
500 participants in the Mandela Washington Fellowship arrived in the United States on June 16, 2014. In 2019, there were 700 fellows.

As part of efforts to decentralize and to reach a large number of young leaders, the Young African Leaders Initiative program created regional leadership centers across the African continent known as the YALI Regional Leadership Center (RLC).
