== Geography ==
It borders with Komaba in the north, Aobadai in the east, and Ikejiri, Setagaya in the west.


== History ==
Ōhashi was named after a bridge with the same name on the Meguro River. Formerly, the neighborhood was part of Komaba in the Village of Kamimeguro, District of Ebara. When address modernization was implemented in Japan, the neighborhood was planned to be named Aobadai 5-chōme and 6-chōme, but the residents hoped that it would be an independent neighborhood and thus it was named Ōhashi.
Prior to the end of the Second World War, land in the north of Ohashi, was used as the location of cavalry and logistics training facilities for the Imperial Japanese Army.  High school sports facilities, public housing and the headquarters of the third division of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police now occupy this site.


== Landmarks ==
The northern section of the Meguro River, a popular venue for cherry blossom viewing, borders Ohashi.
The Meguro Sky Garden, a 400meter linear roof garden constructed 35 meters above street level covering the junction of two major expressways, opened in Ohashi in 2013.   The road junction redevelopment also includes high rise residential housing, retail, a local government branch office, a library, community meeting rooms and outdoor sports facilities.
