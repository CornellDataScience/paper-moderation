Lynn Amedee (born August 3, 1941) is a former American football player and coach. He served as assistant at nine different colleges and as head coach at the University of Tennessee at Martin.
Amedee played quarterback and placekicker under coaches Paul Dietzel and Charles McClendon at Louisiana State from 1960 to 1962. He was not drafted in the 1963 NFL draft but started a pro career with the Edmonton Eskimos. From 1963 to 1964, Amedee played in 16 games for the Eskimos. Over the course of the two seasons, he threw for 1,788 yards on 279 attempts with eight touchdowns. Later Amedee started a coaching career, returning to his alma mater as quarterbacks coach under head coach McClendon from 1975 to 1978.
In 1980, he became head coach at the University of Tennessee at Martin. He guided the school to an 8â€“14 record in two years before resigning in order to join the coaching staff at Southwestern Louisiana (now Louisiana-Lafayette). He left USL after one season, heading to Vanderbilt to become offensive coordinator under head coach George MacIntyre. Amedee left Vanderbilt after the 1984 season, as he was hired as offensive coordinator by new Texas A&M head coach Jackie Sherrill. In 1988, he became offensive coordinator under head coach Galen Hall at the University of Florida, where he drew criticism for his strategy to use sophomore running back Emmitt Smith as a "decoy". 1988 was Smith's only season with less than 1,000 yards rushing.

After McWilliams resignation in 1991, Amedee sat out for a year, before joining Curley Hallman's coaching staff at his alma mater LSU.
