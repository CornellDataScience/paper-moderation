The Sanremo Music Festival 1957 (Italian: Festival di Sanremo 1957), officially the 7th Italian Song Festival (7º Festival della canzone italiana), was the seventh annual Sanremo Music Festival, held at the Sanremo Casino in Sanremo between 7 and 9 February 1957. The show was presented by television presenter Nunzio Filogamo, assisted by Marisa Allasio, Fiorella Mari, Nicoletta Orsomando.
According to the rules of this edition every song was performed in a double performance by a couple of singers or groups, with some artists performing multiple songs. This edition included four nights, containing two semi-finals, a final and "Free Authors Competition" night.
The winner of the festival was "Corde della mia chitarra", performed by Claudio Villa and Nunzio Gallo. The winner of the competition also went on to represent Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest 1957, with Gallo chosen from the two interpreters. Initially the songs accepted for the festival were 20 then dropped to 19, as one song was disqualified for being published earlier.

Each of the four nights included overall twenty performances, ten songs with two performances for each, except for the second night which presented nine songs and overall eighteen performances. The song "La cosa più bella" performed by Carla Boni and Tonina Torrielli was excluded from the second evening for its earlier publication in a juke box in Milan as a version engraved by Cristina Jorio. Five songs advanced from each semi-final to again compose ten songs for the third and final night.

The fourth night, called "Free Authors Competition" (Italian: "Concorso liberi autori"), included ten different songs with their own ranking and scoring, focused on their writing qualities.
