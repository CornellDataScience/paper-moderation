Workshop of the Telescopes is a two-disc compilation album by the American rock band Blue Öyster Cult, released by Sony Music/Columbia Entertainment in 1995. All of the material on this album was recorded prior to the Imaginos sessions; some of it was previously only available on promo discs (marked (*)), and a few others were previously unavailable on CD (marked (+)).
The CD comes with an explanatory booklet outlining the development of Blue Öyster Cult and their rise to fame throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
The album served as a basis of the double-disc reissue of The Essential Blue Öyster Cult in 2012, sharing 21 tracks, substituting some tracks with their live counterparts.
