She is a funk album by Harry Connick Jr. recorded in 1994, accompanied by his newly formed funk band. "(I Could Only) Whisper Your Name" was included on Columbia Records' soundtrack from action-comedy The Mask, starring Jim Carrey. It was also Connick's only single to reach the Billboard charts, peaking at #67. The album was certified Platinum.


== Reception ==

In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau panned She, finding McLean's lyrics "dumb" and the band's style of funk lacking in "elasticity and panache".


== Tour ==

Connick took his funk music on a tour of the United Kingdom in 1994, and later to the People's Republic of China in 1995, playing at the Shanghai Center Theatre.
29 October 1994 at the Brighton Centre, some fans left unhappy with the change of direction not expecting the jazz funk of the 'She' album, despite the tour being billed as supporting the new album. Those that remained enjoyed a very energetic performance.
Connick's funk albums She, and Star Turtle sold respectably, though some fans were upset with Connick's departure from his jazz roots.
