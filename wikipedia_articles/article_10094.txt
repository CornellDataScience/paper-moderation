== History ==

Until the Finnish War of 1808–1809 and the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, the province of Västerbotten included a small portion of what is now northern Finland. This area was later incorporated into Finnish Lapland. The province of Ostrobothnia (Finnish: Pohjanmaa, Swedish: Österbotten), was located on the Finnish side of the Gulf of Bothnia, and its name is still in use today.
Following the treaty of Fredrikshamn, which redefined the outlines and orientation of Sweden, Västerbotten County was split in 1810. The northern part became Norrbotten County. The Swedish-speaking residents of Norrbotten, a multilingual region, began identifying as norrbottningar, with the new county borders fostering a local identity. Today, Norrbotten is considered a separate province, even though provinces had lost their administrative and legal significance hundreds of years before 1810.
Västerbotten Regiment served as the provincial regiment.


== Dukes of Västerbotten ==
Since the 13th century, Swedish princes from certain dynasties have been created dukes of various provinces. Since 1772, these titles have been purely nominal.

Prince Gustaf Adolf (1906-1947)
