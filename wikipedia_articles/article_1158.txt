The national parks of Nigeria are preserved, enhanced, protected and managed by the Nigeria National Park Service.
The Nigeria National Park Service is a parastatal under the Federal Ministry of the Environment, and is headed by a conservator general.
It works closely with the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation.
The first national park was Kainji Lake, established by the military ruler General Olusegun Obasanjo in 1979. The National Parks Governing Board and five new National Parks were set up in 1991.
Yankari Game Reserve was upgraded to a national park in 1992, although it was later handed over to the Bauchi State government in June 2006.
The parks cover a total land area of approximately 20,156 km2 (7,782 sq mi), or about 3% of Nigeria's total land area.

== Development ==
The establishment and evolution of Nigeria's national park system is a testament to the nation's commitment to preserving its rich natural and cultural heritage. The development of this system can be traced through several significant phases and events:


=== Colonial Era and Early Conservation Efforts (Early 20th Century) ===
The roots of Nigeria's national park system can be traced back to the colonial period when British colonial authorities acknowledged the ecological and cultural importance of certain regions within the country. During this time, their primary focus was on limited conservation efforts with a strong emphasis on safeguarding wildlife and preserving habitats, particularly for the purpose of hunting and game preservation. However, it's important to note that during this era, local populations were often excluded and displaced from these areas in the name of conservation.
One notable example of an early conservation initiative occurred in the Cross River region, which now constitutes a significant part of Cross River National Park. The establishment of Cross River National Park marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Nigeria's national park system. The area's unique biodiversity and pristine natural landscapes captured the attention of colonial authorities, leading to efforts to protect the region and its wildlife.
During this period, the primary objectives were aimed at maintaining populations of native species and preserving their natural habitats. These efforts were driven by the colonial administration's interests in promoting hunting and game preservation for recreational and economic purposes, rather than any deep-seated commitment to ecological conservation.
One of the consequences of these early conservation initiatives was the displacement and exclusion of local communities from their traditional lands. The British colonial authorities often implemented policies that restricted access to these areas, which had been used by local populations for centuries. This created a complex dynamic between conservation and the rights of indigenous people, a challenge that would continue to be addressed in the development of Nigeria's national park system over time.


=== Independence and Formation of the National Parks Service (1960s) ===
In the wake of Nigeria's attainment of independence in 1960, there emerged a heightened awareness of the critical importance of preserving the nation's unparalleled biodiversity and natural landscapes. This recognition was driven by a growing understanding of the ecological, cultural, and economic value of the country's diverse ecosystems. In response to this awareness and in a bid to address the pressing need for effective conservation measures, the Nigerian Conservation Foundation was established in 1982. The foundation marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of Nigeria's approach to conservation. As a non-governmental organization, the foundation swiftly assumed a central role in advancing the cause of environmental preservation and the development of Nigeria's national park system.
The Nigerian Conservation Foundation embarked on a mission, working in close collaboration with both the government and local communities. This collaborative approach was instrumental in promoting conservation efforts and laying the groundwork for the establishment of new national parks. The foundation leveraged its resources, expertise, and outreach to not only advocate for the protection of natural areas but also to engage with local communities, whose support and involvement were deemed essential for the success of conservation initiatives. By fostering partnerships and cooperation between governmental bodies, indigenous populations, and environmental organizations, the foundation played a pivotal role in advocating for the preservation of Nigeria's unique natural heritage and promoting the sustainable management of these precious resources. This approach not only helped safeguard the nation's biodiversity but also contributed to the broader goals of ecological sustainability and the protection of Nigeria's cultural and ecological patrimony.


=== National Park Establishment (Late 20th Century - Early 21st Century) ===
The Nigerian government has, over the years, demonstrated a strong commitment to recognizing and preserving the nation's natural and cultural heritage through the establishment of national parks. These protected areas serve as crucial repositories of the country's diverse ecosystems, as well as its rich cultural and historical significance. The establishment of several national parks has been a pivotal step in this direction, with each park strategically located within various ecological zones of Nigeria to ensure comprehensive conservation coverage.
One of the most notable national parks in Nigeria is Yankari National Park, which was officially established in 1991. Yankari National Park, located in the northeastern part of the country, is renowned for its unique combination of wildlife, geothermal features, and cultural heritage. It encompasses a wide range of ecosystems, including savannas, forests, and wetlands, making it a biodiversity hotspot. Yankari National Park is home to diverse species of mammals, birds, and reptiles, making it a popular destination for wildlife enthusiasts and ecotourists.
Another significant addition to Nigeria's national park system is Gashaka-Gumti National Park, also established in 1991. This vast park, situated in the northeastern part of the country, is the largest national park in Nigeria and one of the largest in West Africa. Gashaka-Gumti National Park is characterized by its rugged and picturesque landscapes, with high mountains, dense forests, and pristine rivers. The park is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including chimpanzees, elephants, leopards, and numerous bird species. Its remote location and unspoiled nature make it an essential conservation area.
Kamuku National Park, established in 1991 as well, is another vital component of Nigeria's national park system. Located in the northwest of the country, this park is known for its extensive woodlands and dry savannas. Kamuku National Park plays a crucial role in conserving the unique flora and fauna adapted to these arid environments. It is an important habitat for species such as antelopes, baboons, and diverse birdlife. The park's establishment has helped protect these ecosystems and the wildlife that call them home.


=== Biodiversity Conservation and Research ===
Nigeria's national parks are not only important for conservation but also serve as sites for scientific research. They have provided researchers, both local and international, with unique environments for studying and understanding the nation's exceptional flora and fauna, including numerous endangered species. These research initiatives aim to inform and enhance conservation strategies and further the knowledge of Nigeria's natural heritage.


=== Challenges and Conservation Efforts ===
Despite their establishment, Nigeria's national parks have faced various challenges, including habitat degradation, poaching, illegal logging, and conflicts with local communities. To address these challenges, the Nigerian government, in collaboration with non-governmental organizations and international organizations, has implemented a range of conservation efforts. These initiatives encompass community engagement, capacity building, anti-poaching measures, and environmental education programs.


=== International Recognition and Collaboration ===
Several of Nigeria's national parks have gained international recognition for their ecological importance. Some have been designated as UNESCO Biosphere Reserves or recognized under international conservation agreements, fostering collaboration with global conservation organizations. These partnerships contribute to enhanced conservation efforts and the protection of the parks' unique ecosystems.


=== The Future of Nigeria's National Parks ===
As Nigeria continues to expand its national park system, there is a growing emphasis on promoting sustainable ecotourism. This approach aims to generate revenue for park management while simultaneously supporting the conservation of Nigeria's rich biodiversity. As the nation evolves, its national parks remain vital for preserving its natural treasures and fostering sustainable development.
