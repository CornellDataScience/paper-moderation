The 42d Tactical Missile Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit, formed in 1985 by the consolidation of two units.  The first is the 2d Search Attack Squadron, which tested antisubmarine warfare tactics and equipment at Langley Field, Virginia during World War II.  The second is the 942d Forward Air Control Squadron, which was activated following the Korean War, but does not appear to have been equipped or manned.  The consolidated squadron has not been active.
