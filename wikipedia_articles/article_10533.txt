The Bayfield 40 is a Canadian sailboat that was designed by Ted Gozzard for cruising and first built in 1982.


== Production ==
The design was built by Bayfield Boat Yard in Clinton, Ontario, Canada, starting in 1984, but the company went out of business in 1988 after a factory fire and production ended then.


== Design ==
The Bayfield 40 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of balsa-cored fibreglass, with wood trim. It has a staysail ketch rig, with aluminum spars, a clipper bow with a bowsprit and trailboards, a raised counter transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed long keel. It displaces 21,000 lb (9,525 kg) and carries 8,200 lb (3,719 kg) of lead ballast.
The boat has a draft of 4.92 ft (1.50 m) with the standard keel.
The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 4JHE diesel engine of 44 hp (33 kW) or a Westerbeke 52 hp (39 kW) diesel for docking and manoeuvring. The fresh water tank has a capacity of 100 U.S. gallons (380 L; 83 imp gal).
The design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with two double berths aft with optional raisable privacy panels in between and a U-shaped settee in the main cabin with a drop-down table that converts to a double berth. The galley is located on the port side forward. The galley is U-shaped and is equipped with a two-burner propane-fired stove, an electric refrigerator and a sink. A navigation station is aft of the galley, on the port side. The head is located just aft of the forepeak and includes a shower. The forepeak houses sail lockers and the anchor locker, accessible from the deck above.
Ventilation is provided by a port and hatch each in the aft cabins, plus two forward opening hatches and two opening ports in the head. There is a total of ten opening ports and four opening hatches, plus a large opening skylight just aft of the main mast.
For sailing the design is equipped with a total of 11 winches for the halyards and the sheets.


== Operational history ==
In a 1994 review of the Bayfield 40, Richard Sherwood wrote, "the lines of the hull are traditional. The foresail rig is unusual in a big ketch. Cabin layout, with a midships galley and no vee berths, is distinctly different."
