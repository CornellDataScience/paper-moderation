The Zen Tricksters are an American Grateful Dead cover band. For over forty years, the Zen Tricksters have been playing Grateful Dead covers and jam band music, as well as derivative original songs. The band started out as the Volunteers, playing small venues around New York's Long Island.  At its core, the band has been composed of Jeff Mattson on lead guitar and vocals, for most of its history, Tom Circosta on rhythm guitar and vocals, and Klyph Black on bass and vocals.  
Over the years, the Zen Tricksters have gone through several lineup changes. Jennifer Markard was a founding member and  original songwriter and vocalist in the band its first ten years of touring.   Both Jeff Mattson and one of their former members, keyboard player Rob Barraco, was called to play with Phil and Friends for three shows in October 1999, and Rob continued to play with Phil Lesh and Friends, and with such groups as the Dark Star Orchestra, the Other Ones, and the Dead.  Their current lineup, in addition to Mattson, Circosta, and Black, includes Dave Diamond on drums.
In 2006 they began touring with former Grateful Dead singer Donna Jean Godchaux MacKay as Kettle Joe's Psychedelic Swamp Revue, with Drummer Joe Ciarvella.  In late 2006 the band changed drummers and formed Donna Jean and the Tricksters. In 2009 the band morphed into the Donna Jean Godchaux Band and it retained Jeff Mattson. The Zen Tricksters went on hiatus from touring but Klyph Black, Tom Circosta and Dave Diamond are touring with additional musicians as Klyph Black & Rumor Has It.
The Zen Tricksters remain a cohesive extended family of musicians who get to play together in different formats throughout every year where and when schedules allow.
