Waynflete School is a private, co-educational, college preparatory day school established in 1898 for early childhood education (from age three) to the 12th grade. It is located in the West End of Portland, Maine.


== History ==
In 1898, Waynflete School was established by Agnes Lowell and Caroline Crisfield. During a trip to England, they became interested in statesman and educator William Waynflete, after whom the school is named. The school opened with forty-nine students, admitting small numbers of boys even from its early days. In the early twentieth century, Waynflete adopted a progressive education model emphasizing physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development through hands on learning, as championed by philosopher John Dewey. In 1950, boys past the fourth grade were admitted, and in 1967, boys were admitted into the Upper School.


== Academics ==
Lower School provides education from early childhood (ages 3 and 4) to fifth grade, with the Middle School serving sixth through eighth grades, and Upper School serving ninth through twelfth grades. The school has approximately 550 students, with an average classroom size of 13 students, and a student to teacher ratio of nine to one.
Cocurricular activities such as student government and community service are offered in Middle and Upper School.
Waynflete School won the state Science Olympiad 10 times, most recently in 2024. The Portland Press Herald has called the school a "dynasty" in science competitions.
