Naturally occurring iron (26Fe) consists of four stable isotopes: 5.845% of 54Fe (possibly radioactive with a half-life over 4.4×1020 years), 91.754% of 56Fe, 2.119% of 57Fe and 0.286% of 58Fe. There are 28 known radioactive isotopes and 8 nuclear isomers, the most stable of which are 60Fe (half-life 2.6 million years) and 55Fe (half-life 2.7 years).
Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of iron has centered on determining 60Fe variations due to processes accompanying nucleosynthesis (i.e., meteorite studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in mass spectrometry technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the stable isotopes of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the Earth and planetary science communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge.


== List of isotopes ==


== Iron-54 ==
54Fe is observationally stable, but theoretically can decay to 54Cr, with a half-life of more than 4.4×1020 years via double electron capture (εε).


== Iron-56 ==

56Fe is the most abundant isotope of iron.  It is also the isotope with the lowest mass per nucleon, 930.412 MeV/c2, though not the isotope with the highest nuclear binding energy per nucleon, which is nickel-62. However, because of the details of how nucleosynthesis works, 56Fe is a more common endpoint of fusion chains inside supernovae, where it is mostly produced as 56Ni.   Thus, 56Ni is more common in the universe, relative to other metals, including 62Ni, 58Fe and 60Ni, all of which have a very high binding energy.
The high nuclear binding energy for 56Fe represents the point where further nuclear reactions become energetically unfavorable. Because of this, it is among the heaviest elements formed in stellar nucleosynthesis reactions in massive stars. These reactions fuse lighter elements like magnesium, silicon, and sulfur to form heavier elements. Among the heavier elements formed is 56Ni, which subsequently decays to 56Co and then 56Fe.


== Iron-57 ==
57Fe is widely used in Mössbauer spectroscopy and the related nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy due to the low natural variation in energy of the 14.4 keV nuclear transition. 
The transition was famously used to make the first definitive measurement of gravitational redshift, in the 1960 Pound–Rebka experiment.


== Iron-58 ==
Iron-58 can be used to combat anemia and low iron absorption, to metabolically track iron-controlling human genes, and for tracing elements in nature. Iron-58 is also an assisting reagent in the synthesis of superheavy elements.


== Iron-60 ==
Iron-60 is an iron isotope with a half-life of 2.6 million years, but was thought until 2009 to have a half-life of 1.5 million years. It undergoes beta decay to cobalt-60, which then decays with a half-life of about 5 years to stable nickel-60. Traces of iron-60 have been found in lunar samples.
In phases of the meteorites Semarkona and Chervony Kut, a correlation between the concentration of 60Ni, the granddaughter isotope of 60Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found, which is evidence for the existence of 60Fe at the time of formation of the Solar System. Possibly the energy released by the decay of 60Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide 26Al, to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of 60Ni present in extraterrestrial material may also provide further insight into the origin of the Solar System and its early history.
Iron-60 found in fossilised bacteria in sea floor sediments suggest there was a supernova in the vicinity of the Solar System approximately 2 million years ago. Iron-60 is also found in sediments from 8 million years ago. In 2019, researchers found interstellar 60Fe in Antarctica, which they relate to the Local Interstellar Cloud.
The distance to the supernova of origin can be estimated by relating the amount of iron-60 intercepted as Earth passes through the expanding supernova ejecta. Assuming that the material ejected in a supernova expands uniformly out from its origin as a sphere with a surface area of 4πr2. The fraction of the material intercepted by the Earth is dependent on its cross-sectional area (πR2earth) as it passes through the expanding debris. Where Mej is the mass of ejected material.

The number of 60Fe atoms per unit area found on Earth can be estimated if the typical amount of 60Fe ejected from a supernova is known. This can be done by dividing the surface mass density (Σej) by the atomic mass of 60Fe.

An example calculation for the distance to the supernova point of origin is given below. This calculation uses speculative values for terrestrial 60Fe atom surface density (N60 ≈ 4 × 1011 atoms2/m) and a rough estimate of the mass of 60Fe ejected in a supernova explosion (10-5 M☉).

More sophisticated analyses have been reported that take into consideration the flux and deposition of 60Fe as well as possible interfering background sources. 
Cobalt-60, the decay product of iron-60, emits 1.173 MeV and 1.333 MeV as it decays. These gamma-ray lines have long been important targets for gamma-ray astronomy, and have been detected by the gamma-ray observatory INTEGRAL.  The signal traces the Galactic plane, showing that 60Fe synthesis is ongoing in our Galaxy, and probing element production in massive stars.
