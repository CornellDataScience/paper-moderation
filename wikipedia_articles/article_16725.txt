The Metropolitan Archdiocese of Valladolid (Latin: Archidioecesis Metropolitae Vallisoletanus) is a Latin Church diocese of the Catholic Church in Spain, elevated from the rank of diocese in 1857.
The seat of the archbishop is the Cathedral of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción. Valladolid also houses the National Sanctuary of the Gran Promesa.


== History ==
It was erected as the Diocese of Valladolid on 25 December 1595, by the bull Pro excellenti of Pope Clement VIII, from the territory of the Diocese of Palencia. The creation of the diocese put an end to the centuries-old conflict between the Abbot of Valladolid and the Bishop of Palencia.
The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption was consecrated in 1668. Following the Concordat of 1851 between Spain and the Holy See, the diocese was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan Archdiocese by Pope Pius IX on July 4, 1857, with the suffragan sees of Ávila, Ciudad Rodrigo, Salamanca, Segovia, and Zamora. The diocesan seminary was founded in 1855. In 1955 the territory of the diocese was considerably enlarged.
