Abe played in all three of their games: quarter-finals against Liga MX side C.D. Guadalajara in which he scored Antlers' third goal, semi-finals against La Liga side Real Madrid where Antlers lost 3–1, and the third place play-off against Argentina's River Plate.

=== Barcelona B ===
In July 2019, he transferred to Barcelona B on a four-year contract, for a reported transfer fee of €1.1 million. Abe said that it was a "difficult decision to leave the team mid-season" but that he believes "the various challenges...are absolutely necessary for [his] growth." Barcelona's club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said that he hoped Abe would become a leading player in La Liga. Abe played a total of 3,899 minutes for Kashima Antlers across two and a half seasons.
Abe scored his first goal for the reserves in a 3–3 draw against UE Cornellà on 17 November 2019. He followed this up with a header in the next match on 23 November, a 1–1 draw away versus Lleida Esportiu. He scored his first brace in a 3–1 win versus CF La Nucía on 15 December 2019.
On 2 February 2020, Abe ruptured a tendon in his right hamstring against AE Prat. He underwent a successful surgery which rendered him on the sidelines for an estimated five months, putting him in doubt for the 2020 Summer Olympics. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the competition to be delayed by a year.


=== Urawa Red Diamonds ===
In July 2023, Abe signed for J1 League club Urawa Red Diamonds following the expiration of his contract at Barcelona B.
