=== Early career ===
Born in West Hampstead, Mapes played for both Tottenham Hotspur and Cardiff City at youth level, before beginning his senior career at Harrow Borough in 2001. Following this, he had a trial spell at Greenock Morton in 2002, during which he made 2 appearances, before spells at non-league sides Edgware Town, Wealdstone and Berkhamsted Town.

=== Crawley Town ===
In the summer of 2004, he joined Conference Premier side Crawley Town. He started in Crawley's first game of the season, and remained a regular player early in the season. He requested a transfer away from Crawley due to a lack of regular football in February 2005, with Mapes saying, "I am 22 and I need to be playing regular football" and that "if I can't get it at Crawley then I will have to go somewhere else." In March 2005, he joined Canvey Island on loan, before being recalled in April 2005. Mapes was released by Crawley Town at the end of the 2004–05 season after making 36 appearances in all competitions for the club.

In August 2008, he left Hayes & Yeading United, rejoining former club Hendon a few days later, and would go on to make 16 league appearances, scoring twice during this spell.
