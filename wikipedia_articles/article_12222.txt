The Pennsylvania Academy of Music (PAM) was a private music school located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States. The academy provided music instruction to students with skill levels ranging from elementary to advanced.


== History ==
The Pennsylvania Academy of Music was a 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded in 1989.
The building PAM occupied on Prince Street in downtown Lancaster is now owned by Millersville University and operates as the Ware Center.


== Education ==
The Pennsylvania Academy of Music was one of twelve pre-collegiate autonomous schools accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music, and was a member of the National Guild of the Community Schools of the Arts. It was one of the only schools in the United States that offers a pre-collegiate program in chamber music.
In 2009, the school entered into partnerships with the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing and Lancaster Mennonite School in Lancaster.  An exchange program is offered through the China Conservatory, and a high school diploma program focused in music is offered through Lancaster Mennonite High School.


== Bankruptcy ==
On May 27, 2010, PAM filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Under new administration, the Bankruptcy Court supported the re-opening the school on September 1, 2010, at Liberty Place. PAM continued to work with the Court as they tried to transition out of bankruptcy and make progress toward operating as a sustainable institution. On Wednesday, March 30, 2011, PAM chairman Dr. Thomas Godfrey announced the board of directors' decision to close the academy.
