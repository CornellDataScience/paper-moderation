Regarding the song's meaning, Metallica vocalist and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield said:

"We could be a much more efficient race if we just allow computers to help us. And yeah, they are helping us, but how far does that go? All of that craziness. So 'Spit Out the Bone' is that your bones aren't needed. They break."
Hetfield states the phrase "Spit Out the Bone" was taken from British punk rock band Charged GBH's song "Passenger on the Menu" from their 1982 album City Baby Attacked by Rats.
On the writing of the song, drummer Lars Ulrich said:

" '[Spit Out the Bone]' was just an adventure, man. I have versions of that song that are two to three minutes longer. We just kept going and going and going. That was also the first song where we went, 'Wait a minute, is there too much of a good thing here?' And then we started peeling it back. It was one of those where you just keep going to different universes and different modes and areas because it was super fun."
Robert Trujillo, Metallica's bassist, singled "Spit Out the Bone" as the song from Hardwired... to Self-Destruct that he looked most forward to performing. Metallica's lead guitarist, Kirk Hammett, called "Spit Out the Bone" the "Mount Everest" of the new album, alluding to its complexity and speed. In 2024, Slayer guitarist Kerry King praised "Spit Out The Bone" as a "killer fucking song."
