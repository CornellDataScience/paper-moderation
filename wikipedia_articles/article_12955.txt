Following this he began working in a grocery store as a salesman and bookkeeper. At age 22 he took a job as bookkeeper and cashier at a Boston drygoods store. While working there he met Alexander Lindsay and John Curr who were to become his partners. The three formed a partnership called Sibley, Lindsay & Curr and opened a small store in Rochester called "The Boston Store" (no relation to the chain of the same name owned by The Bon-Ton). This was later renamed "Sibley, Lindsay & Curr Company." Rufus Sibley was president of the company from 1868 until his retirement in 1924. He died in Rochester on May 12, 1928, and is buried there in Mount Hope Cemetery.

On November 21, 1885, Sibley married Elizabeth Conkey of Rochester; the couple had two children: John R. Sibley and Elizabeth Sibley. Mrs. Elizabeth Sibley died on August 26, 1918. 
In addition to his business interests Rufus Sibley was involved in a number of social and charitable interests. He was an avid breeder of Jersey Cattle, which he raised at his "Moose Hill Farm" in Spencer, Massachusetts. He was president of the American Jersey Cattle Club. He was active in the Episcopal Church, and was deputy six times at the Church's General Convention. He was a member of the Genesee Valley Club, the Country Club of Rochester, and the Rochester Art Club.
He served on the Executive Committee and was treasurer and president of the Board of Trustees of the University of Rochester. He was an honorary trustee of Hahnemann Hospital in Rochester, which later became the Genesee Hospital, and of the Rochester School for the Deaf.
