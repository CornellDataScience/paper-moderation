AofA, the International Meeting on Probabilistic, Combinatorial and Asymptotic Methods for the Analysis of Algorithms is an academic meeting that has been held regularly since 1993 in the field of computer science, focusing on mathematical methods from analytic combinatorics and probability for the study of properties of algorithms and large combinatorial structures. In early years, different formal names were used, but the meeting and associated community of researchers has always been known as AofA.


== Structure ==
The tradition is a weeklong meeting, alternating between invited workshops and open refereed conferences with contributed papers chosen by a program committee. The meetings feature invited presentations from senior researchers, about half from within the community and half from related research areas. Since 2014, the inaugural lecture at each conference has been delivered by the winner of the Flajolet Lecture Prize.


== Publishing ==
The proceedings of the conferences are now published by the Schloss Dagstuhl Leibniz Center for Informatics in the open access series Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics. The proceedings are freely available from the conference website and also from DROPS, the Dagstuhl Research Online Publication Server. The proceedings of prior editions have been published in several venues, and special issues of several journals have been devoted to papers from AofA conferences.


== Related meetings ==
From 2002 to 2008, the community organized a second meeting each even-numbered year, the Colloquium on Mathematics and Computer Science (MathInfo).  Due to overlap among participants and content, the community decided to merge the two meetings to the present format.  From 2003 to 2019, the AofA community also organized the one-day ANALCO meetings at the SODA conference.
The community has also organized symposia and special journal issues to celebrate Donald Knuth’s 1,000,0002 birthday, to celebrate Philippe Flajolet’s 60th birthday, to honor the memory of Phillipe Flajolet, and to celebrate Don Knuth’s 80th birthday.
AofA conferences are indexed by several bibliographic databases, including the DBLP, Google Scholar and The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies.
