=== High school ===
While running for San Ramon Valley High School, Bauhs improved every year. As he improved, he had the smaller Division I schools recruiting him in his junior year. He signed with Chico State, but at the end of his senior season, after he finished second at the CIF California State Meet in the 3200 meters, there were much bigger schools such as Oregon that were interested.


=== Collegiate ===
Bauhs decided to stay at Chico, and there he became one of the most successful Division 2 collegiate athletes in history. He amassed eight All-Americans honors. He also won three national titles.
During the 2007 track season, Bauhs beat Nicodemus Naimadu of Abilene Christian to win the 10k title. Naimadu was previously undefeated. Later on, Bauhs broke the four-minute-mile barrier, and American Age Group Records in the half-marathon. He also broke the NCAA Division II American records in the 5k and 10k. During his time at Chico, Bauhs ran under coach Gary Towne.
