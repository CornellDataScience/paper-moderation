The Parties is an American psych rock group based in San Francisco, California, United States.
The Parties' brand of powerpop harkens back to the classic era of melodic songwriting popularized by such bands as The Byrds, The Beatles, The Zombies, The Who and The Beach Boys, as well as bands involved in the 1980s Paisley Underground scene and the 1990s shoegaze phenomenon. The Parties have received accolades from such national publications as Uncut magazine, AllMusic and Amplifier Magazine. They have played in the International Pop Overthrow Festival, New York's CMJ and Austin's SXSW, and have shared the stage with The Shore, Sky Parade, The New Fidelity, The Waking Hours, Prabir and The Substitutes, The High Dials, and The Parson Redheads.


== History ==
The Parties were formed in 2004 by Red Planet alumnus Jeremy Powers and Richmond, Virginia songwriter and drummer John L. Morgan IV, who had a joint love for all things Lennon-McCartney. The two soon hooked up with bassist Rex Padayhag, who grew up in the Philippines playing with various bands on the Manila psychedelic pop circuit, and Oakland guitarist Sarah Melfeld.


== Three Ring Circus ==
Three Ring Circus Records saw the band in Sacramento multiple times and asked to put out the EP (in digital format only) that the boys had already recorded themselves and that they had been selling at shows. They agreed to this but wanted more exposure and press. Failing to get that, the band sent a letter to Rainbow Quartz Records along with a demo, and the band had a new deal.

=== Cryin' Shame EP ===
The Cryin' Shame EP was released in 2009.

The EP was released in November, 2009 by Rainbow Quartz, and showcased everyone's songwriting and singing.

=== Coast Garde ===
Coast Garde was the band's second CD with Rainbow Quartz and first with the new line-up with drummer Rob Uytingco. The release was followed by multiple shows, but reviews were mixed, and Rex Padayhag, who had been the glue in the band as a lead and harmony singer while playing bass, organ, and piano, ultimately decided to leave.
