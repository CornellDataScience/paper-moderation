D'Agosto's big break came when he was cast as the ethical committee chairman Larry Fouch in the dark teenage comedy Election (1999), while he was still a senior at Creighton Prep. The film was written and directed by Alexander Payne, another alumnus of Creighton Prep. D'Agosto starred in the film Psycho Beach Party (2000) while still in college. In 2002, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a full-time acting career.
He landed guest appearances on primetime television series such as Boston Public, ER, Six Feet Under, Cold Case, House, Supernatural, and Without a Trace. He appeared in three episodes of The Office. He also played West Rosen on the series Heroes.
