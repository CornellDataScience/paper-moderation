The 2000 season was the Jacksonville Jaguars' 6th in the National Football League and their sixth under head coach Tom Coughlin.
The Jaguars in 1999 had obtained an NFL-best record of 14â€“2 and thrashed the Miami Dolphins in their divisional-round game. However, they were helped to this by an extremely easy regular-season schedule. In 2000, the Jaguars were severely hit by the loss of safety Carnell Lake for the entire season to foot surgery, and by an ultimately career-ending knee injury to right tackle Leon Searcy. Further offensive line injuries, notably to left tackle Zach Wiegert and center John Wade, crippled the Jaguars all season, with the result that after a fair start the Jaguars fell in Week 4 to five consecutive losses and were out of the running for a postseason berth by December, and thus knocking them out of the playoffs for the first time since 1995 when the franchise was first established. Ultimately the team's tally of wins was halved from 1999. At the close of the season, the Jaguars also had problems with being $31 million over the salary cap.
