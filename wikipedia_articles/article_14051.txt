Bishop Ryder Memorial Church, Birmingham, was a parish church in the Church of England in Birmingham from 1838 to 1960.


== History ==
Built on Gem Street in Gosta Green in Birmingham, it was a red brick and stone church designed by Thomas Rickman and Richard Charles Hussey in the Gothic style. It was built to commemorate Henry Ryder, Bishop of Lichfield and was consecrated in 1838. A parish was created out of St Martin in the Bull Ring in 1841.
The chancel was rebuilt in 1894 by J. A. Chatwin funded by J.C. Holder in memory of his father, Henry Holder. In 1925 the parish of St Mary's Church, Whittall Street, Birmingham was united with Bishop Ryder, and in 1939 part of the parish and the benefice of St Bartholomew’s Church, Birmingham, were united.
The church was demolished in 1960. Gem Street also no longer exists, but the church was located in the middle of the modern Aston University campus.

This was replaced in 1882 when a new organ by J.C. Banfield was opened on 25 November at a cost of £350. It was renovated in 1939 by Walter James Bird. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.
