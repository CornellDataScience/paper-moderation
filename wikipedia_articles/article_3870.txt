== Service ==

The 10th New York Volunteer Infantry, the National Zouaves or McChesney's Zouaves, was recruited in New York city and Brooklyn and mustered into federal service, April 27, 30, May 2, and 7, 1861, for a two-year enlistment. From Sandy Hook, where it was encamped, the regiment embarked for Fortress Monroe on June 5, and was ordered to join the reserve during the battle of Big Bethel.
Headquarters were established at Camp Hamilton, near Fortress Monroe, and here the regiment was stationed until the opening of the campaign on the Peninsula the following year. In May 1862, the regiment moved to Norfolk and Portsmouth and on June 7, was attached to the 3d brigade, 2nd division, V Corps, which it joined at Bottom's bridge on the Chickahominy. It was active in the Seven Days' battles, encamped at Harrison's Landing until late in August, when it returned to Newport News, whence it was ordered to Manassas and fought bravely in the Second Bull Run, losing 115 men in killed, wounded and missing.
At South Mountain and Antietam, it was held in reserve; was in action at Shepherdstown, after which it was assigned to the 3d brigade, 3d division, II Corps, with which it fought at Fredericksburg, where almost one-half of the members of the regiment who went into action were killed, wounded or missing.
A portion of the winter was spent in the performance of guard duty at headquarters and the original two years members not reenlisted were mustered out at New York on May 7, 1863.  The remainder of the regiment was consolidated into a battalion of four companies to which were later added two companies of new recruits and the veterans of the 8th N. Y. artillery. The battalion was made provost guard of the 3d division, II Corps and in March, 1864, was attached to the 3d brigade, 2nd division, II Corps. It was active at the Wilderness, where the loss was 95 members, at Spottsylvania, Laurel Hill, the North Anna river, Totopotomy, and Cold Harbor.
It then served during the long siege of Petersburg, being engaged in the early assaults on the works there, at the Weldon Railroad, Deep Bottom, Strawberry Plains, Reams' Station, the Boydton Plank Road, Hatcher's Run, White Oak Road, and in the final assault on the fortifications, April 2, 1865. In the pursuit which followed the evacuation, the 10th was in line with its brigade and performed guard duty near Richmond until the welcome orders to return home. The regiment was mustered out at Munson's Hill, VA., June 30, 1865.
