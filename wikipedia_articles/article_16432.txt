The Škoda Enyaq iV is a battery electric compact crossover SUV manufactured by Škoda Auto. It was introduced in September 2020 in Prague, while mass production commenced in November 2020. It utilizes the Volkswagen Group MEB platform, with the Volkswagen ID.4 being a sister model.


== Name ==
The name is derived from the Irish name Enya, which originates from the Gaelic word ‘eithne’, meaning ‘essence, spirit or principle’. The Enyaq is the first model of a new naming convention within the Škoda's range where electric models' names will start with ‘E’.


== Overview ==

The production model is called Enyaq iV and was revealed on 1 September 2020. It is assembled at the Škoda plant in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic for the European market. The serial production of the car for the European market in the Czech Republic commenced on 25 November 2020. The first cars have been delivered to customers in the Scandinavian region in late April 2021, and in Western and Central Europe in May 2021.
The Enyaq iV will be available either as rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, with three different battery capacities and five performance versions. The base model will have a 55 kWh battery pack and a 109 kW (148 PS; 146 bhp) electric motor mounted on the rear axle. The most powerful variant will be the RS, with two motors having a combined power of 225 kW (306 PS; 302 bhp).
The Škoda Enyaq has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.257.
The boot holds 585 litres, but there is no frunk (storage under the bonnet) unlike in some electric vehicles.
The Enyaq iV also has a Sportline variant, with a different interior and exterior styling and extended standard features.
On 17 March 2023, Škoda announced that an Enyaq Laurin & Klement would be launched. The Skoda Enyaq Laurin & Klement 85 and 85x joins the lineup of electric vehicles on VW's MEB platform, equipped with the latest-generation APP550 electric motor. This advanced motor offers enhanced performance and improved efficiency compared to its predecessor (150 kW). Initially introduced on the Volkswagen ID.7, the APP550 drive unit delivers 210 kW (290 PS; 280 bhp) of power and 550 N⋅m (406 lb⋅ft) of torque. It is available in both rear-wheel and four-wheel-drive configurations for both the SUV and Coupe versions of the Enyaq. With this upgraded drivetrain, the Enyaq L&K variant boasts impressive acceleration, achieving 0 to 100 km/h in approximately 6.6 to 6.7 seconds, coming close to the sporty Enyaq RS version which achieves it in 6.5 seconds.


=== Enyaq Coupé ===

The Enyaq Coupé was officially presented on January 31, 2022, in Prague. Production started at the Mladá Boleslav plant in February 2022, with an initial production target of 120 units per day. The coupé doesn't offer an entry-level version with the smaller 55kWh battery available on the regular Enyaq, but a sporty RS version completes the range.
The coupe version is 4 mm (0.16 in) shorter in length and 6 mm (0.24 in) taller. 


=== Enyaq RS iV & Enyaq Coupe RS iV ===
The Enyaq Coupe RS iV (vRS in the UK) is fitted with an 77 kWh (280 MJ) or 82 kWh (300 MJ) net battery pack which will grant the model a WLTP driving range of 309 miles (497 km). Being equipped with twin motors – one on either axle – will provide all-wheel drive and a combined power output of 299 PS (220 kW; 295 bhp) and maximum torque of 460 N⋅m (339 lb⋅ft). This will make the RS variant capable of accelerating from 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) in 6.5 seconds and a top speed of 111 mph (179 km/h). In 2022, the starting price for the Enyaq Coupé iV vRS in the UK, was £51,885.
In October 2022, Škoda launched the Enyaq RS iV alongside the already available Enyaq Coupe RS iV.

== Safety assist ==
The safety assist feature is taken into account in the 2021 EuroNCAP rating:

The ENYAQ iV has a speed assistance system as standard. This uses a camera and digital mapping to determine the local speed limit and the driver can choose to allow the system to adjust the speed automatically. A seatbelt reminder is standard for all seating positions. A fatigue-detection system monitors driver alertness but this is available as an option only and was not included in the assessment. Lane assistance warns the driver if the car is drifting out of lane and gently corrects the vehicle path. The system also intervenes more aggressively in some more critical situations. The AEB system performed well in tests of its response to other vehicles, with collisions avoided or mitigated in almost all scenarios.
