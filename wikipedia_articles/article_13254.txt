Moscow is a town in Somerset County, Maine, United States. The population was 475 at the 2020 census.


== History ==
Moscow Air Force Station, a radar installation comprising numerous steel antenna towers in three linear arrays on 1,494 acres about five miles northeast of the town center, was erected in the late 1980s and decommissioned in 2002. The site was put up for online auction in September 2011 through the U.S. General Services Administration. In July 2010 a wind farm was proposed as a possible use for the land, and the town began setting zoning regulations for wind turbine placement in December 2010. By October 2011, the radar antenna arrays had been dismantled and removed from the deactivated station, but microwave towers and various buildings remained. As of November 2011, the land was still up for auction with two bidders active. Because the site has been federally owned and tax-exempt, the town has been denied property tax revenue for decades.
