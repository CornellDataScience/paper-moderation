Júlia Bartel Holgado (born 18 May 2004) is a Spanish footballer who plays as a midfielder for Women's Super League club Chelsea and represents Spain national under-23 team.


== Club career ==
Bartel played for amateur clubs such as UE Castellbisbal and Sant Cugat FC as a junior before joining Espanyol's youth team. In 2019 she chose to sign with Barcelona when she was 15 years old.
After two years playing for youth and reserve teams of the club, she made her debut for the first team on 27 June 2021 against Eibar (replacing Vicky Losada who was playing her final game for the club); at 17 years and one month old, Bartel became the fourth-youngest player to have ever played for the main team. On 16 April 2022, in her third game and first start, Bartel made an assist against Valencia for a goal scored by Aitana Bonmatí.
She played exclusively for the B-team in the 2022–23 season, something which continued in the first half of 2023–24, though she made her UEFA Women's Champions League debut on 13 December 2023 as Barcelona defeated FC Rosengård 6–0 in Sweden.
On 27 June 2024, Bartel announced she was leaving Barcelona; it had previously been reported that Women's Super League champions Chelsea would be signing her. On 3 July, Bartel signed a three-year contract with Chelsea, with the option to extend for an additional year.


== International career ==
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic delaying major youth national tournaments in 2020, Bartel has amassed extensive experience playing for many junior levels of Spain's national team.  She scored an impressive goal against Portugal on 9 April 2022, and was one of the key proponents for Spain to reach the final round of 2022 UEFA Championship, having appeared in all six games played by Spain throughout the qualification phase.
