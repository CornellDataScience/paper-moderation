== History ==


=== 1992–1997: Formation ===
Bachelor Girl formed in December 1992 when songwriter and record producer, James Roche, met vocalist Tania Doko. Roche had previously worked, on keyboards or producing, with Tommy Emmanuel, John Farnham and Jack Jones (aka Irwin Thomas). Doko was a classically trained university student. Roche was crafting a demonstration tape of a song he had written for an Australian girl group, Girlfriend, and when the original singer cancelled, he recruited Doko. They began writing songs and recording other demos together. In December 1997, Bachelor Girl signed with Gotham Records, distributed by BMG, after being rejected by Sony.


=== 1998–2001: Waiting for the Day ===
Bachelor Girl's debut single, "Buses and Trains", was released on 18 June 1998. The song peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart and No. 6 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. In 1999, it appeared in the top 30 on the Swedish Singles Chart and reached the top 100 in the UK. Their second single, "Treat Me Good", was issued in November 1998 and reached the top 40 in Australia and New Zealand. The related album, Waiting for the Day, was released in November and peaked at No. 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In May 1999, their third single, "Lucky Me" reached the top 50 in Australia and New Zealand. It reached the top 20 on the Finnish Singles Chart. In August, the album was issued internationally as Breaking Through from Down Under on Arista Records.


=== 2002–2004: Dysfunctional and split ===
In July 2002, Bachelor Girl released "I'm Just A Girl" as the lead single from their forthcoming second studio album. The song reached the Australian top 30. Their second album, Dysfunctional, was released in August and peaked in the top 30. "Drowning Not Waving" was released in October 2002 as the second and final single from the album.
The band recorded their third studio album in 2003-2004 but was never released as the duo amicably split in 2004.


=== 2004–2017: Hiatus, Loved & Lost: The Best of Bachelor Girl and Beautifully Wrong – The Lost Songs ===
In April 2011, a compilation album, Loved & Lost: The Best of Bachelor Girl, was released by Sony Music Australia. It featured four tracks abandoned from the third studio album. Doko stated in interviews that the band did not feel there was enough material from their two albums to fill a greatest hits album, and they decided to use cuts from the unreleased third studio album. In May and June, Bachelor Girl performed three gigs to promote the album. In August 2011, the previously unreleased third album was released digitally, titled Beautifully Wrong – The Lost Songs.
In 2012, Doko moved to Sweden where she worked as a singer/songwriter and vocal coach. Roche worked with a number of Australian musicians, including producing Anthony Callea's number one album, Backbone in 2016.


=== 2017–present: Reformation, "Speak" and "Calling Out Your Name" ===
In mid-2017, Roche completed a three-week trip to Stockholm, Sweden, where he met up with Doko. The duo wrote and recorded with various Swedish writers and producers. Roche said, "I had a fantastic time; the context there of musical creation and endeavour is inspiring and energising. I've returned with a collection of songs I am so excited about - I can't wait to complete the production on them!". "Speak" was released on 18 June 2018, exactly 20 years since the release of "Buses and Trains".
In February 2023, Bachelor Girl released "Calling Out Your Name".
