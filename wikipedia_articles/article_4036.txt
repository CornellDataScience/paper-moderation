== Biography ==
Chilton was born in London on 16 July 1932, to working-class parents (his father was a musical hall comedian) and was evacuated to Northamptonshire, where he began playing the cornet at the age of 12. He switched to trumpet at 17 and after doing national service in the RAF (1950–1952) he formed his own jazz band, playing at Butlins.
He worked in Bruce Turner's Jump Band from 1958 to 1963. A film of their exploits called Living Jazz (1961) was made by director Jack Gold. Chilton later appeared in Alex Welsh's Big Band.
He later worked with Wally Fawkes, also known as the cartoonist "Trog", and in January 1974 formed John Chilton's Feetwarmers, who began accompanying British jazz singer and writer George Melly. Together they made records and toured the world for nearly 30 years.
Chilton won a Grammy Award for Best Album Notes on Bunny Berigan (1983) and was nominated in the same category in 2000 for The Complete Lester Young Studio Sessions on Verve. In the same year he won the British Jazz Award for Writer of the Year. He wrote Who's Who of Jazz.
