Nineteen full expansions for the MMORPG EverQuest II have been released, as well as three Adventure Packs.
With EverQuest II, Sony Online Entertainment introduced the concept of Adventure Packs. Adventure Packs are meant to be smaller "mini-expansions" to the game, adding a plot line with several zones, new creatures and items to the game via digital download with a smaller fee. As time went on, however, the development team has decided to release free zones and content instead of including them in  Adventure Packs. Some recent releases include a new starting city, Neriak, with a new starting race, Arasai; and new high level dungeons The Throne of New Tunaria and the Estate of Unrest.
Until 2011, expansions were available in both DVD and digital formats, but can now be downloaded through a digital service. The digital versions often come with a bonus features such as a creature that the player can put in their in-game house. Expansions generally introduce many new zones with many plot lines, new features, many new creatures and items, new cities, and often come with a boost in the level cap or a new player race. While it may be easier to download the expansions digitally, traditional retail offers more content.


== Expansion packs ==


=== Desert of Flames ===

Desert of Flames is the first expansion for EverQuest II. It featured a new land mass to explore, PvP arenas, a level increase from 50 to 60, a new climb ability and new items and monsters. The major quest line for the expansion is commonly known as "The Peacock Line" - the series of 17 or so quests culminates with a raid requiring the player to group up with his guildmates to slay an entity known as "The Godking".
Players can choose from a selection of rewards to be used in the weapon slot depending on their class, for example a mage would receive an item named "Wand of Second life" which can also be changed at will into a two-handed weapon - "Staff of Second life". This quest takes place throughout the Desert of Ro from the sinking sands to the living tombs and eventually the Silent City.
New zones include the Sinking Sands, Pillars of Flame, Clefts of Rujark and the dervish city of Maj'Dul. Also many instances such as Poets Palace and Shimmering Citadel are available with Desert of Flames.
Desert of Flames holds a 79% rating on GameRankings.


=== Kingdom of Sky ===

Kingdom of Sky featured a new region to explore, located high above the skies of Norrath, known as the Overrealm. It included a new level cap of 70 for adventurers and artisans, new items and quests, new monsters to fight, alternate ways of advancing the player's character (achievement points) and the ability to increase a guild to level 50.
Purchase of the expansion granted each character in any account that bought the expansion an Aviak hatchling. If the expansion was bought in a brick and mortar store, the account was also granted one Carnivorous plant. The Carnivorous Plant acts as a house pet which can be fed items from the world, and depending on what is fed to it, will yield a useful item.
The Overrealm is composed of floating islands which originate from the Plane of Sky. Transportation to the Overrealm works like in The Shadows of Luclin; when a player wishes to go there, he or she obtains a teleportation shard from the overseer of a wizard spire on the ground. The overseer NPC then grants to the player character a teleportation shard which flags the player as one wanting to go to the Overrealm. Every five minutes, the spires activate, sending player characters to the Overrealm. If a player originates in Antonica or the Commonlands, he or she will be sent to the Tenebrous Tangle. If a player originates in the Thundering Steppes or Nektulos Forest, then he or she is sent to the Barren Sky. If the player originates in the Enchanted Lands or the Feerrott, he or she is sent to the Bonemire.
As with both the original game and the first expansion, a new epic quest line is included called the "Claymore" line. The start of this quest line can be completed solo in the outdoor areas, but it will soon require a group and many segments require large investments of time "camping" where the NPCs will spawn and gain quest updates. The last parts of this quest must be completed within a raid (a group of 7+ players), the first being in an area known as "Ascent of the Awakened" in which the players must have two groups (12 players). The final part takes place in Deathtoll, a zone intended for four groups (24 players), and requires an epic access quest in itself to enter. In the end players choose from an archetype specific reward (in some cases there are multiple choices).
Once a player has installed this expansion pack and reaches adventuring level 10, a character is granted achievement experience through discovering new areas, finding precious treasure and status items, killing monsters with specific names, completing select quests, and completing certain collections of items.
Kingdom of Sky holds a 78% rating on GameRankings.

It also introduced a new starting city, the tree city of Kelethin, along with new overland, dungeon, instance and raid zones. There are zones for all levels of characters in this expansion.
The expansion raised the achievement point cap to 100 and the guild level to 60. The expansion also included 6 new Heritage quests and new races to combat like the clockworks, kobolds and bugbears.
The boxed retail edition of Echoes of Faydwer includes the base game plus the first two expansions: Desert of Flames and Kingdom of Sky.
Echoes of Faydwer holds a 84% rating on GameRankings.

Two months leading to the release of the expansion, Daybreak Games launched an "Against the Elements" event in EverQuest II where players could take on quests revolving around rampaging elemental creatures. In their review of the expansion, MMORPG.com gave the game a 7.5 out of 10 rating. Writer Paul Eno commented that while it had a good amount of new content and a "fun and adventurous" story, he found that the new additions to the Ascension class system introduced in Kunark Ascending only added to the already high number of abilities characters had accumulated over the past several years and may put off new players. Combat was also seen as slow and "borders on monotony", which would be best experienced with a group rather than playing solo.


=== Blood of Luclin ===
