Soul Searchin' is the 16th studio album by Australian singer-songwriter, Jimmy Barnes. The album is Barnes' fourth album of soul and R&B classics following Soul Deep (1991), Soul Deeper... Songs from the Deep South (2000), and The Rhythm and the Blues (2009). The album was announced on 8 May 2016, alongside a one-hour documentary that aired on the Nine Network in June and a national tour that commenced in August. The album was released on 3 June 2016.
The Soul Searchin' documentary followed Barnes to America's south on a discovery of lost soul gems and the musicians who made them and visit the places that inspired them.
Barnes said, "The idea was to find more obscure soul songs that people may not have heard – the diamonds in the rough. I was just looking and looking for songs that for one reason or another were skipped over or they were too hard for radio or the singer was cross-eyed – for whatever reason, these songs were missed. I can't wait to get to sing these songs again when I take them on tour. It will be wild."


== Reviews ==
Jeff Apter of Rolling Stone Australia gave the album 3 out of 4 saying; "Barnesy keeps his angry bird squawk in check for much of the album; his voice has rarely sounded better, or more controlled."
Collin Morris from Stuff NZ gave the album 4 out of 5 saying; "Here we have Barnes searching and finding many less-known gems and imbuing them with a real sense of what soul is about."
