He was a contemporary of the Beatles, and sang with several of their rival groups, including The Searchers from 1960 to 1961, and The Remo Four from 1962 to 1963. He began singing at the age of 12 and in 1958 entered Hughie Green's "Opportunity Knocks" contest at Liverpool's Adelphi Hotel. He was spotted by the Searchers who asked him to join them and their first gig together was at St Luke's Hall Crosby Merseyside.
