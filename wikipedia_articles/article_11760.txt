The same year he was awarded the Edvard Prize 2011, from TONO, for the album Transmission – Rievdadus in open class under Ultima Oslo Contemporary Music Festival. The Jury Rationale states  "soundscape of natural sounds, voices, breathing and occasional heavy rhythms fuse into exciting music. It is unpredictable, Johan Sara Jr invites us on a journey, and we want to follow. From the minimalist to the great epic, all rooted in something we can all recognize ourselves in – namely, our roots."
Sara Jr. has also written music for radio and theater, most recently for the Hålogaland Teater (Idag og i morgen, 2005).
