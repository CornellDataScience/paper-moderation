==== Hamilton ====
Stetson first coached the Hamilton Continentals men's football team from 1982–1984. In 1983, he hired Sean McDonnell to be one of his assistant coaches. In 1984, they went 6–1–1. This was Hamilton's first winning record since 1967.


==== Boston University ====
Stetson's performance at Hamilton led to a head coaching position at Boston University, a Division I school. He took over from Rick Taylor, who had moved up to become the school's athletic director. However, he struggled in his time there, with a record of 3–8 in 1985 and 4–7 in 1986. Two games before the 1987 season was finished, he was dismissed as the team was at 3–6. Boston finished the season 3–8.


==== Hartwick ====
After his job at Boston ended, Stetson became a health-insurance salesman. When he saw in the newspapers that Hartwick College was going to revive its football program, he applied for the job in July 1991 and got accepted. He coached the Hawks until 2001, and Hartwick enjoyed eight winning seasons out of his last nine at the school with three postseason appearances. When he left the school in 2002, Mark Carr took over. In his time there, he had a record of 58–38–1, setting the program record for most career wins. Carr would break that record in 2015.


==== New Hampshire ====
Stetson then joined the coaching staff of Sean McDonnell, his former assistant coach now head coach at the University of New Hampshire. The Wildcats were 3–8 in his first year, but in 2004 UNH was 10–3 and reached the quarterfinals of the NCAA Division I-AA championships. In 2005, he helped guide the Wildcats to an 11–2 record and the team's second straight Atlantic 10 North Division title. UNH was awarded the No. 1 seed in the Division I-AA championships and advanced to the quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.

In 2005, Stetson returned to coaching the Hamilton men's football team. He took over from Pete Alvanos, whose teams went 5–35 in five seasons. In 2011, Stetson guided the football team to their highest win total in 15 years. The following year, he stepped down as Hamilton's men's football head coach. He was replaced by Andrew Cohen.
