Clapp practised the Law in Abingdon, Virginia, from 1839 to 1841. He moved his practise to Holly Springs, Mississippi in 1841. He was also the owner of large Southern plantations with African slaves in Mississippi and Arkansas.
Clapp was a Whig until 1850, when he joined the States' Rights Party. From 1856 to 1858, he served as a judge in the Mississippi House of Representatives, representing Marshall County, Mississippi. During the 1860 presidential campaign, he was an elector for John C. Breckinridge's campaign.
At the outset of the Civil War, Clapp attended the Mississippi Secession Convention in favor of the Confederate States of America. He represented the state of Mississippi in the First Confederate Congress from 1862 to 1864.
To assist the Confederate States Army, Clapp was asked by Christopher Memminger, the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury, to oversee cotton production in Mississippi as well as parts of Alabama and Louisiana. Clapp would ensure that cotton be turned into Confederate uniforms and sent to Richmond, Virginia, where General Richard Taylor distributed them. Clapp served in this capacity until Union General Edward Canby forced him to hand over the cotton in New Orleans, Louisiana.
