The Ministry of Justice, Islamic Affairs, Public Administration and Human Rights handles any legal reforms that might improve the justice system of Comoros. The Union government forces include the Army of National Development and the gendarmerie. When the latter force serves as the judicial police, it reports to the Minister of Justice. Although National Commission for Preventing and Fighting Corruption (CNPLC) exists to prevent corruption, the Ministry of Justice seldom prosecutes corruption cases.
