Lower Sabie is one of Kruger National Park's Main rest camps and is situated on the southern bank of the Sabie River, in the southeastern section of the park. It is connected to the main Skukuza camp by the H4-1 tarred road (43 km (27 miles) apart), which is often considered to be the busiest road in the park.


== History ==
When the Sabie Game Reserve was first proclaimed in 1898, the area around where Lower Sabie now lies was undeveloped. The initial road to the area was a two-track gravel road running up from Crocodile Bridge and continuing to Skukuza, built in 1926 and 1927 after the park was re-established as the Kruger National Park. The Gomondwane Road (H4-2) and the Mativuhlungu Loop (S82) roughly follow this route today. In 1930, the quarters of ranger Tom Duke were converted into a five-bedroom wood-and-steel guest house, made available to tourists. Between 1928 and 1931, the Sabie River Road (H4-1) was built between Skukuza and the site of what is now Lower Sabie. This guest house was a financial failure and was demolished in 1932. A set of 3 six-bedroom units was built to provide replace the guest house and provide accommodation in this region of the park. In 1935 a portion of a £50,000 grant was used to expand Lower Sabie to accommodate 200 visitors, which included retrofitting the old huts to be made mosquito-proof. The first camp supervisor was appointed in 1936.
