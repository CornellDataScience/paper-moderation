== Great War Monument ==

Leeds is home to a Great War (World War I) monument that was constructed by the American War Mothers.  The six-foot-tall granite pedestal bears a bronze tablet that lists seventy-six men and two Red Cross nurses who participated in the conflict.  The call to build the monument went out in the April 15, 1920 issue of the Leeds News.  The November 18, 1920 issue of the Leeds News listed the names of the men and women who were to be placed on the monument to ensure that no names had been missed.  The August 4, 1921 issue of the Leeds News announced that on August 7, 1921 the monument would be given its official dedication at 3 o'clock by the Great Northern right of way near the depot.  It was written that "...this little spot has been seeded down and well cared for this summer and makes a pretty setting for the monument."  The monument currently resides in Firemen's Memorial Park.
The steel helmet and service coat of Leeds service member John A. Montgomery is currently located at the National WW1 Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. Montgomery was assigned to the "...9th Company, 2nd Motor Mechanics Regiment, 2nd Battalion Air Service Mechanics. The 2nd Battalion was attached to the French Tank Corps 4 May 1918 to 13 December 1918 and employed in the repair of French Renault and Schneider tanks. On 5 December 1918, French General Estienne gave the 2nd Battalion Air Service Mechanics permission to wear the insignia of the French Tank Corps." The helmet and service coat both bear the insignia of the French Tank Corps.
