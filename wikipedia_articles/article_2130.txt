The Edinburgh Sevens is played annually as part of the IRB Sevens World Series for international rugby sevens (seven a side version of rugby union). The 2007 competition took place on 2 and 3 June, and was held at Murrayfield. It was the last leg of the 2006–07 IRB Sevens World Series.
New Zealand won the tournament after defeating Samoa, 34–5, in the final. Fiji were upset by Wales, 21–14, in their quarter-final. A Fijian victory would have guaranteed them the overall 2006–07 Series crown, however, as a result of their loss and New Zealand's tournament victory, New Zealand won the overall series.
