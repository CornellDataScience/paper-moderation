== Plot ==

The story takes place in Puebla and follows the lives of the prestigious Murillo family, consisting of Adriana (Ariadne Díaz), Magdalena (Ana Isabel Torre) and Rebeca (Michelle Renaud), who are orphans.
Adriana is married to Alonso Gaxiola (Horacio Pancheri), owner of a Talavera factory, and her two sisters live with them. Their marriage seems perfect, since they don't realize that Rebeca is a capricious and twisted woman who knows how to pass in front of everyone like a true angel; only Magdalena suspects her sister's intentions.
Rebeca has always been secretly in love with Alonso and that is why she envies Adriana, but that feeling turns into hatred when Adriana becomes pregnant. Meanwhile, Magdalena faces tragedy when her fiancé vanishes on their wedding day, leading her to seek solace in a convent. Shortly after Magdalena goes to the capital, Alonso travels abroad to close a deal and export his products. During this time, Adriana suffers an accident, leaving only her baby alive. Alonso finds comfort in his daughter, Lucía, as Rebeca takes advantage of the situation.

24 years later, Alonso (René Strickler) and Rebeca (Claudia Ramírez) are now married. She has become a mother to Lucía (Esmeralda Pimentel) and is the best wife in the world. The couple has a second daughter, Nora (Ximena Romo), who is 22 years old; she is frivolous, capricious and manipulative, just like her mother.
Rebeca is full of frustrations, stemming from her realization that she will never have Alonso's complete love. Seeking consolation in extramarital affairs only adds to her loneliness. After humiliating her lover in turn, he commits suicide and she underestimates the determination of his family, especially his brother, Marcelo (Erick Elías), to uncover the truth. 
Marcelo quickly discovers the secret behind his brother's death within the Gaxiola Murillo family in Puebla. Seeking revenge, he skillfully interacts with them and falls in love with Lucía, who initially rejects and then accepts him. The intrigues, problems and misunderstandings persist. Tragedies are commonplace in this family, where hidden secrets resurface. Lucía seems lifeless, devoid of happiness. Only she can create her own joy.
