The Kilombero Plain lies to the north and west, and separate the Mahenge Mountains from the Udzungwa Mountains. Selous Game Reserve lies to the east. The Mbarika Mountains lie to the south and southwest.

== Ecology ==
The Mahenge Mountains are covered with evergreen forest, miombo woodland, grassland, and heathland. Forests extend from 460â€“1040 meters elevation, and vary in composition and species type with elevation and rainfall. The lower elevations of the mountains and surrounding plains are covered in deciduous miombo forests and woodlands.
An analysis of satellite images taken between 1999 and 2003 found 19 km2 of the mountains were still covered in evergreen forest.
Water is generally scarce due to the limestone plateau, but despite this the area gives its name to the Mahenge Toad (Mertensophryne loveridgei). The rare tree Dombeya amaniensis is also found in this region.
The Mahenge Scarp Catchment Forest Reserve, established in 1954, is 3.87 km2 in area and begins 8 km west of Mahenge town. This forest has been heavily encroached upon for illegal logging.
Sali Forest Reserve, established in 1954, preserves 1890 ha between 1050 and 1500 meters elevation. The forest reserve includes montane and submontane evergreen forests, along with wetlands, dry grasslands, and rocky outcrops. Mselezi forest reserve, also established in 1954, preserves 2245 ha between 500 and 900 meters elevation, and includes riverine lowland forest and semi-evergreen lowland forest.
