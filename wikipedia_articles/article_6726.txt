Red Hot + Riot (a.k.a.  Red Hot + Riot: The Music and Spirit of Fela Kuti) is the fourteenth in a series of music compilation projects produced by Paul Heck and John Carlin of the Red Hot Organization and Grammy-winning music producer Andres Levin (Music Has No Enemies) to be used as a fundraising tool for AIDS awareness efforts. The album, which takes inspiration from the late Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, was released by MCA on October 15, 2002 and featured more than three dozen artists on a score of tracks.
It is the fifth overall album in the series to focus chiefly on the work of a single composer or musician, following tributes honoring the works of Cole Porter (Red Hot + Blue), Antônio Carlos Jobim (Red Hot + Rio), George Gershwin (Red Hot + Rhapsody: The Gershwin Groove) and Duke Ellington (Red Hot + Indigo).
