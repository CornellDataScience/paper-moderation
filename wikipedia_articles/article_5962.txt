In an Interview with Billboard talking about the film's music, Disney Channel's VP of music and soundtracks, Steven Vincent, said that the first step in making the sequel's music was "developing a [musical] palette that builds on what we had and what kids loved about the first one". "It all starts with the scene and what energy fits that idea" Vincent added.
Talking about the film's original song, "It's Going Down", songwriter Antonina Armato stated that "The [song] was never in the script...The scene was supposed to be all dialogue, but [director] Kenny Ortega and Steven Vincent had this ambitious idea to create a big musical moment that had influences from Hamilton, hip-hop and West Side Story, using counter melodies and chants. Luckily, we came through for them".
