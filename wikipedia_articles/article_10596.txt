== History ==
The town of Rutherfordton was founded in 1787 to serve as the new seat of Rutherford County, taking over from Gilbert Town. Its foundation was planned by a committee appointed by the General Assembly of North Carolina. The committee purchased 50 acres of land on Cleghorn Creek from landowner James Adair. The plots included a hill safe from flooding, making it a perfect site for building the town courthouse. By 1791, the main streets of Rutherfordton had been laid out on a grid plan. Next was the construction of the U.S. Post Office in 1798, and the establishment of the Rutherfordton Academy in 1806.
Rutherfordton was at the center of the flourishing North Carolina gold industry between 1790 and 1840. During that period, 70% of the American gold supply came from western North Carolina. German-born goldsmith Christopher Bechtler minted the first U.S. gold dollars in Rutherfordton.
