In 1994, Diehl founded the Media Trust, a communications charity that connects the media and communications industry with charities, communities and young people in need of vital communications training, mentoring and resources.

In 2000, Diehl founded the Community Channel as a subsidiary company of The Media Trust. The Community Channel was the UK's first dedicated television channel for social action, charity and community stories, inspiring viewers to change their lives and engage with their communities. The channel became an independent charitable Community Benefit Society in 2016 after a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise funds through selling community shares. Community Channel relaunched as Together TV in 2018.

An INSEAD Entrepreneur in Residence since 2006, and founding Advisory Board member of INSEAD’s ground-breaking Social Entrepreneurship Programme (in Fontainebleau and Singapore), Diehl founded the Social Founder Network with a vision to connect founders of charities and social enterprises in person and online, and to provide support and profile to social founders in order to grow their skills and impact.
