Darrell Wayne Bevell (born January 6, 1970) is an American football coach who is the passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as offensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings from 2006 to 2010, the Seattle Seahawks from 2011 to 2017, the Detroit Lions in 2019 and for the first 11 games of the 2020 season before being named the interim head coach for the remainder of the Lions season, and the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2021. Bevell played college football for the University of Wisconsin, where he was a four-year starting quarterback.


== Playing career ==
After playing at Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, Bevell redshirted as a freshman quarterback at Northern Arizona University.  At the time, Brad Childress was NAU's offensive coordinator.  Bevell then embarked on a two-year Latter-day Saint mission to Cleveland, Ohio.  When he returned from his missionary service, Childress had joined the staff of Barry Alvarez at Wisconsin. Bevell was offered scholarships from NAU and Utah, but he decided to join Childress at Wisconsin.
Bevell guided the 1993 Wisconsin Badgers football team to a winning season culminating in a Rose Bowl victory over UCLA. That win represented the Badgers first Rose Bowl appearance since 1963 and first ever Rose Bowl win. In that game, Bevell had a 4th quarter scramble for 21 yards for a touchdown that sealed the Badger victory. They defeated the Duke Blue Devils 34–20 in the 1995 Hall of Fame Bowl, giving Wisconsin back-to-back bowl wins for the first time ever.  Bevell finished his college career with 19 school records, including most passing yards in a single game (423) and in a career (7,686).

==== Seattle Seahawks ====
In 2013, the Seahawks finished the season with a 13–3 record and eventually defeated the Denver Broncos by a score of 43–8 in Super Bowl XLVIII. Bevell's rushing offense was 4th in the league with 2,188 yards and averaged 136.8 yards per game. Overall in total offense, Bevell's team finished 18th in the league, producing 339.0 yards per game.
In 2014, the Seahawks finished the season at 12–4 and attempted to repeat as Super Bowl champions. They came short in Super Bowl XLIX, which they lost to the New England Patriots after passing on 2nd and goal from the 1-yard line with 26 seconds left. Trailing 28–24, Russell Wilson targeted wide receiver Ricardo Lockette, but New England's Malcolm Butler made a game-saving interception with 20 seconds left on the clock. The play call was widely criticized.  "I can't believe the call," NBC color commentator Cris Collinsworth said after the play was run. "You have Marshawn Lynch. You have a guy who's been borderline unstoppable. ... If I lose this Super Bowl because Marshawn Lynch can't get into the end zone, so be it. So be it. I can't believe the call".  Sports Illustrated writer Peter King called the play one of the worst calls in Super Bowl history, and so did retired NFL hall of famer Deion Sanders.  Retired running back Emmitt Smith, the NFL's all-time leading rusher, went even further, calling it the worst play call in the history of football. Bevell acknowledged making the call, but also remarked that Lockette could have been more aggressive on the play. Wilson said the play was a "good call", and lamented throwing the interception and "not making that play." Carroll, though, said the last play was "all my fault", and called Bevell "crucially important to our future." The head coach added that Seattle would have run the ball on a subsequent play. "We don't ever call a play thinking we might throw an interception."
Bevell was dismissed from the Seahawks in January 2018.


==== Detroit Lions ====
On January 16, 2019, Bevell was hired by the Detroit Lions to be their offensive coordinator, replacing Jim Bob Cooter. On November 28, 2020, Bevell assumed the title of interim head coach following the firing of head coach Matt Patricia. On December 6, 2020, Bevell won his head coaching debut against the Chicago Bears by a score of 34–30. He missed the team's week 16 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers due to COVID-19 protocols.


==== Jacksonville Jaguars ====
On January 21, 2021, Bevell was hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars as their offensive coordinator under head coach Urban Meyer.
