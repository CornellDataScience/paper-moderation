The pedal circle of the a triangle 
  
    
      
        A
        B
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle ABC}
  
 and a point 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
 in the plane is a special circle determined by those two entities. More specifically for the three perpendiculars through the point 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
 onto the three (extended) triangle sides 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
        ,
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,b,c}
  
 you get three points of intersection 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            a
          
        
        ,
        
          P
          
            b
          
        
        ,
        
          P
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{a},P_{b},P_{c}}
  
 and the circle defined by those three points is the pedal circle. By definition the pedal circle is the circumcircle of the pedal triangle.
For radius 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  
 of the pedal circle the following formula holds with 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  
 being the radius and 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
    {\displaystyle O}
  
 being the center of the circumcircle:

  
    
      
        r
        =
        
          
            
              
                |
              
              P
              A
              
                |
              
              ⋅
              
                |
              
              P
              B
              
                |
              
              ⋅
              
                |
              
              P
              C
              
                |
              
            
            
              2
              ⋅
              (
              
                R
                
                  2
                
              
              −
              
                |
              
              P
              O
              
                
                  |
                
                
                  2
                
              
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r={\frac {|PA|\cdot |PB|\cdot |PC|}{2\cdot (R^{2}-|PO|^{2})}}}
  

Note that the denominator in the formula turns 0 if the point 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
 lies on the circumcircle. In this case the three points  
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            a
          
        
        ,
        
          P
          
            b
          
        
        ,
        
          P
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{a},P_{b},P_{c}}
  
 determine a degenerated circle with an infinite radius, that is a line. This is the Simson line. If 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
 is the incenter of the triangle then the pedal circle is the incircle of the triangle and if 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
 is the orthocenter of the triangle the pedal circle is the nine-point circle.
If 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
 does not lie on the circumcircle then its isogonal conjugate 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
  
 yields the same pedal circle, that is the six points  
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            a
          
        
        ,
        
          P
          
            b
          
        
        ,
        
          P
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{a},P_{b},P_{c}}
  
 and  
  
    
      
        
          Q
          
            a
          
        
        ,
        
          Q
          
            b
          
        
        ,
        
          Q
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q_{a},Q_{b},Q_{c}}
  
 lie on the same circle. Moreover, the midpoint of the line segment 
  
    
      
        P
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle PQ}
  
 is the center of that pedal circle.
Griffiths' theorem states that all the pedal circles for a points located on a line through the center of the triangle's circumcircle share a common (fixed) point.
Consider four points with no three of them being on a common line. Then you can build four different subsets of three points. Take the points of such a subset as the vertices of a triangle 
  
    
      
        A
        B
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle ABC}
  
 and the fourth point as the point 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
, then they define a pedal circle. The four pedal circles you get this way intersect in a common point.
