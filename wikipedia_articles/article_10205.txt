Anna Ingrid Caroline Schlyter, (born 9 October 1961) is a Swedish artist focusing on sculpture and installations. She is best known for her furniture sculptures that have been exhibited in numerous countries.


== Early years and education ==

Caroline Schlyter was educated at Konstfack, Department of Fine Art and at Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm. In 1988, at the beginning of her studies, Schlyter created a rolled steel prototype of a chair that she named Lilla h (known as Little h). It was first exhibited at The House of Culture, Stockholm in 1989. The chair was shown as an installation where it was covered with 7 m (23 ft) of red velvet from the wall down over the chair and out onto the floor. That same year, Schlyter entered the international art/design scene when participating in an international furniture design competition in Asahikawa, Japan, where she received an Award Winning Entry for her chair Little h, now executed in wood, moulded from one single piece of birch plywood. "My aim was to create a clean, unbroken line and avoid joints and connecting details...", she said about her work.
Schlyter's design caught the eye of magazine editors and Little h was featured on the cover of several international magazines. Three years later, in 1992, Schlyter was awarded the Utmärkt Svensk Form ("Excellent Swedish Design") award for Little h. The jury's motivation: "Nearest a sitsculpture, which independently and skillfully plays on the modern, nordic bent-wood art. The sovereign curvature gives the impression of stretching the wood's possibilities to the utmost."


== Career and exhibitions ==

The chair Little h was soon after accompanied by other furniture pieces, designed in 1990, with similar one-piece moulded plywood constructions; The Lover – an armchair, The Aunt – a dressing table, Tripp, Trapp and Trull – tables, Fido – a tea-trolley, Little m – a child's chair, which all became The h-family. Leo Gullbring wrote, "Caroline Schlyter's distinctly personal and original designs challenge Swedish furniture traditions."  A major exhibition of her work entitled Familjen h-son, produced by the Swedish Exhibition Agency was first held at the Lönnströms Konstmuseum, Finland, and later travelled around Swedish museums. An accompanying booklet, was published in conjunction with the exhibition.
Caroline Schlyter's h-family has been exhibited at galleries and museums from Europe to Japan to the United States, including:
