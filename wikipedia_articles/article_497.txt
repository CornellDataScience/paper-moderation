30:30 Hindsight is the fifteenth studio album by Jimmy Barnes. The album celebrates 30 years since his chart-topping debut solo album, Bodyswerve in September 1984. It was released in August 2014 and debuted at number 1 in Australia, giving Barnes his tenth solo number 1 album.
30:30 Hindsight was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards; however, it lost to Blackbird by Dan Sultan.


== Promotion ==
Barnes performed "I'd Die to Be with You Tonight" live with Diesel on The X Factor on 25 August 2014.
Barnes said of the album: "We've actually kicked some new life into the songs, I think when people hear this new record, they will get a sense that these are very modern takes on these songs. They sound fresh and they sound new and they sound alive."


== Reception ==
Paul Stewart of the Daily Express wrote, "This is definitely a toe-tapping modern rock album with great ebb and flow and is certainly well worth a listen." Dan Lander of Rolling Stone wrote, "Barnes' voice has lost none of its bite, and he genuinely sounds like he’s ecstatic to be putting fresh life into this collection of old favorites."
