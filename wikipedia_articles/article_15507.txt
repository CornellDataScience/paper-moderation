A First Open or FO, is a type of railway carriage used by British Rail and subsequent operators since privatisation. They were first produced as British Railways Mark 1, and subsequently Mark 2, Mark 3, and Mark 4 variants were produced. This type of carriage is an "open coach" because of the arrangement of the seats inside – other types of carriage may be corridor based variants (FK) or have a brake compartment (BFO or BFK).


== Mark 1 ==
First Open carriages were introduced from 1951.  The first three, for the London Midland Region, were the only Mk1 FO with no centre door, seating 42 in a 2+1 format. The second batch (3003–19), built from 1954, had a centre door in the centre seating bay, splitting the middle window into two thin panes. Carriages from 3020 had a separate centre vestibule with doors and reduced-width bays, still seating 42 in 2+1 format. BR1 type bogies were fitted as standard except on 3076–3080, a test batch built with Commonwealth bogies to improve ride quality. The ride quality of the BR1 bogie became poor after some use and, in 1961, changes were made.  3101–3151 were built with Commonwealth type bogies which became standard for a time, with the weight increasing by 5 tons. BR1 and Commonwealth bogies usually run at a maximum of 90 mph (140 km/h). Later, B4 bogies were fitted to further improve ride quality with a maximum of 100 mph (160 km/h). These carriages were fitted with Pullman gangways on standard 64 ft (20 m) frames and fitted with buck-eye couplers as standard. Buck-eye couplers can be dropped and buffers extended to allow use of screw coupling fitted locomotives. Vacuum brakes and steam heating were fitted as standard.  A number of Mk1 FO were later fitted with air brakes in the late 1960s and 1970s, some retaining vacuum brakes and being dual braked.

=== Livery ===
The livery initially for Mk1 coaches for British Railways in 1951 was crimson lake and cream with black and gold lining, all new Mk1 FO coaches were delivered in this livery up until 1956. In 1956 the standard livery changed to maroon with black and gold lining except for the Southern Region stock which adopted an unlined dark malachite green. The Western Region on the other hand adopted chocolate and cream to sufficient stock to operate its named trains like the Cornish Riviera Express and Torbay Express being two examples. The Southern Region introduced the yellow UIC cantrail stripe denoting first class in 1960 for boat train coaches. Yellow UIC cantrail stripe was later introduced on other regions from 1963. In 1965 Rail Blue was introduced as trailed on XP64 stock the year before and lasted for another 20 years.
