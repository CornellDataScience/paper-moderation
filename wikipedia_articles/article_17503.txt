== History ==
Prior to the establishment of the regional high school, students from Branchville, Frankford Township and Lafayette Township had attended Newton High School as part of sending/receiving relationships, while those from Sussex and Wantage Township had attended Sussex High School.
Created in 1963 as a district, the school opened in September 1966.
Starting in September 2014, high school students from Montague Township School District began attending High Point Regional High School, as part of a sending/receiving relationship under which incoming ninth graders began attending the High Point district while existing students attended Port Jervis High School in Port Jervis, New York until they graduated.
The Montague district began seeking to annul the relationship with High Point Regional and resume sending students to Port Jervis. The Montague district chose to switch back to Port Jervis because Port Jervis offered a lower tuition than High Point; High Point charged $16,368 per student to Montague. All six members of the Montague district voted, in October 2019, to switch back to Port Jervis. The High Point district sought to block this request on the grounds it and its students would be financially impacted. The Montague district stated that the districts signed an agreement in 2018 that would allow Montague to leave at will. By December 2020, the districts were in a legal dispute. The High Point agreement is scheduled to end in 2024.
