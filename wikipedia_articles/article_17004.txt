PT Surya Citra Televisi (SCTV) is an Indonesian free-to-air television broadcaster. It was launched on 24 August 1990 in Surabaya, East Java as Surabaya Central Televisi, broadcasting to the city and its surrounding area. At first, the programming was similar to that of RCTI, broadcasting foreign shows and some of RCTI news programs until they could produce their own. On 30 January 1993, SCTV obtained a national license and eventually moved its operations to Jakarta, changing its name to Surya Citra Televisi and marking the end of 3 year affiliation with RCTI. Its main offices are located in Central Jakarta, with studios in West Jakarta. It is owned by Surya Citra Media, a publicly listed subsidiary of the technology company Emtek.


== History ==

In 1991, SCTV (Surya Citra Televisi) faced public backlash from the Muslim community in Surabaya, Indonesia. The criticism stemmed from two particular programs that were deemed inappropriate for airing during Ramadan, a holy month of fasting and spiritual reflection for Muslims. One of the controversial shows was the popular American television series Wonder Woman, which had become well-known for its focus on the physical strength and beauty of its female lead, portrayed by Lynda Carter. According to local newspapers, Wonder Woman was criticized for "unduly focusing on the physical attributes of women." This was seen as insensitive, given the cultural and religious expectations of modesty during Ramadan. Additionally, an episode of Wok with Yan, a cooking show hosted by Stephen Yan, caused further outrage when it featured the preparation of a pork dish. Since Islam prohibits the consumption of pork, the airing of such content during Ramadan sparked significant discontent among viewers.
In response to the public outcry, SCTV took immediate action by removing Wonder Woman from its programming schedule until the end of Ramadan. The station also issued a formal apology for the airing of the Wok with Yan episode. As a result of this controversy, Mohamoad Noer, the station manager at the time, demanded that SCTV review its programming policies to ensure cultural and religious sensitivities were respected. This incident was one of the early examples of Indonesian television networks grappling with the challenges of balancing popular international content with local religious and cultural norms.
SCTV, which was broadcasting its signal to remote villages such as those in Banyuwangi, was significantly impacted by the criticism. Western television series, which were gaining popularity at the time, had to be carefully curated to avoid similar controversies. The channel's need to adapt was indicative of the broader tension between global media content and local cultural values, especially in regions with strong religious traditions like Indonesia.
By 1997, SCTV recognized the need to modernize its image and cater to a broader audience base. On 1 June 1997, the network underwent a major rebranding effort aimed at offering "more tantalizing all-age programmes." This shift reflected the growing competition in Indonesia's television industry, with networks seeking to attract viewers of all demographics. As part of this revamp, the slogan "Ngetop!"—meaning "popular" or "trendy" in Indonesian slang—was introduced. This new image was designed to resonate with a younger audience and reinforce SCTV's status as a leading entertainment channel.
SCTV's programming during this time became more diverse, with a focus on both locally produced shows and imported content that appealed to a wider range of viewers. This transformation marked a turning point in the channel’s history, helping it solidify its position in the competitive Indonesian media landscape. By 2005, to strengthen its position, SCTV overhauled its logo and changed the tagline to "Satu untuk semua", that means "one for all".
On 18 February 2011, a significant corporate development occurred when the commissioners of Indosiar and SCTV, two of Indonesia’s largest television networks, agreed to merge. This decision was a strategic move by their parent companies, Surya Citra Media (SCM) and Indosiar Karya Media, to consolidate their operations and resources. However, because both Indosiar and SCTV were publicly traded companies, the merger was subject to approval by the Indonesian government and regulatory bodies. The merger was seen as a way for both networks to enhance their market share and improve their financial performance in a rapidly evolving media industry.
Despite initial progress, the merger faced several legal obstacles, particularly regarding tax issues. The complexity of merging two major entities with significant financial stakes resulted in delays and lawsuits. However, in 2014, SCM successfully won a lawsuit related to the merger, clearing one of the major hurdles. The merger eventually moved forward, allowing SCM to streamline its operations and position itself as a dominant player in Indonesian television broadcasting.
These developments in the early 2010s marked a new era for Indonesian television, where consolidation became a key strategy for networks aiming to survive in an increasingly competitive market, particularly with the rise of digital platforms and changing viewer habits.
