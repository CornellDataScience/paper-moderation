The 2012–13 AHL season was the 77th season of the American Hockey League. The regular season began on October 12, 2012 and ended on April 21, 2013. The 2013 Calder Cup playoffs followed the conclusion of the regular season. The Calder Cup was won by the Grand Rapids Griffins for their first Calder Cup in franchise history.


== Regular season ==
On June 28, the Board of Governors approved a minor realignment for the league for the 2012–13 season. The only changes were made in the Western Conference, as three teams swapped divisions for this season: Abbotsford moves to the North Division, Grand Rapids moves to the Midwest Division and Charlotte moves to the newly renamed South Division (formerly West Division). The Eastern Conference remains the same as the previous season. Among the rule changes for this season, the league has adopted video-review for goals, which has been in use in the NHL for years.
Because of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, all NHL players who were still eligible to play in the AHL without clearing waivers were assigned to their AHL teams for the duration of the lockout. The lockout also forced the cancellation of one of the two AHL Outdoor Classics for 2012; as a result, there was only one Outdoor Classic in 2013. The Hershey Bears hosted the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins at Hersheypark Stadium on January 20. The Penguins won the game 2–1 in overtime before a crowd of 17,653 spectators.

=== Relocations ===
As a result of the aforementioned lockout, the Rochester Americans moved a portion of its home schedule to the First Niagara Center in Buffalo, New York to fill the void of its parent club, the Buffalo Sabres, during the lockout (both teams are owned by Terrence Pegula). The team's name and branding remain unchanged.

== Milestones ==
Abbotsford Heat The Marlies, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs, were tied against the Abbotsford Heat when first Steve McCarthy scored a short-handed goal and then Ben Street scored from the faceoff circle.  The two goals in three seconds tied a professional hockey record. Greg Wyshynski of Yahoo's Puck Daddy blog reported that the ECHL, formerly the East Coast Hockey League, had two goals scored in the same span during a 1993 game. However, the comparable record in the NHL is four seconds. Before Thursday, the fastest two goals had been scored in the AHL was five seconds.  The Heat is an affiliate of the NHL's Calgary Flames, and the team went on to win the game, 3-0 on November 1, 2012.
Abbotsford Heat goaltender Barry Brust set a record for longest shutout streak by not allowing any goals for 268 minutes and 17 seconds. The previous record was 249:51, set by Johnny Bower with the Cleveland Barons in 1957.
