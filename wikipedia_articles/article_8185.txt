Surendran had a brief stint as a teacher of English Literature at Calicut University in Kerala before moving to Mumbai in 1986 to work as a journalist, in the footsteps of his maternal uncle, the late C.P. Ramachandran.
Surendran began his career in print media as a journalist with leading English newspapers including The Times of India, Times Sunday Review and Bombay Times. He was a resident editor of The Times of India in Pune for three years from 2003 to 2006. He was the editor of Open Magazine in New Delhi from 2009 to 2012.

Stark and often caustic, his poems reflect his preoccupation with love, death and loneliness.

                          Home, I tell the man turning away in the mirror,
                          My captive. Let him go?
                          Cut my wrist and set off a little sunset.
                          Let him go.
