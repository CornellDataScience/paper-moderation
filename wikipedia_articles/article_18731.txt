== Plot ==


=== Opening ===
In a flashback to 1992, Chuck McGill has not yet experienced the "symptoms" of his psychosomatic electromagnetic hypersensitivity, and he easily changes a light bulb in his dining room chandelier. Jimmy McGill visits Chuck's house shortly after moving to Albuquerque, where he meets Chuck's wife, Rebecca Bois. During dinner, Rebecca is charmed by Jimmy's personality and charisma, which makes Chuck obviously uncomfortable.


=== Main story ===
Jimmy meets Kim Wexler in the HHM document review room, where she is relegated to entry-level work, and proposes that she sue HHM for discrimination and creating a hostile work environment. Kim rejects this idea, suggesting it would be career suicide because no one would ever hire her again. She tells Jimmy to worry about his own job while she worries about hers. Throughout his day, Jimmy is accompanied by junior associate Erin Brill, who claims to want to help Jimmy fit in better at D&M, though Jimmy realizes Clifford Main directed her to "babysit" him in the wake of the controversy over his TV ad.
Kim decides that bringing a major new client to HHM is her best course of action for escaping document review, so she spends her free time calling contacts from law school, law firms, and local businesses. Kim capitalizes on one of these relationships to land Mesa Verde Bank as a client, meaning the potential of millions of dollars in revenue for HHM. Howard Hamlin is happy to have the new client and acknowledges Kim's contribution, but keeps her working in document review.
Chuck promises to work on Kim's transfer out of document review and tells her a story about when Jimmy and Chuck's late father ran a store in Cicero, Illinois. According to Chuck, Jimmy embezzled money, which eventually led to the store's failure. As a result, Chuck is always skeptical of Jimmy's schemes and plans.
Mike Ehrmantraut is approached by Hector Salamanca, the leader of the Salamanca drug cartel and Tuco Salamanca's uncle. Hector has no issue with Tuco spending time in prison as a learning experience, but objects to the length of the sentence he will receive for assault with a deadly weapon. He offers Mike $5,000 to tell police the gun at the scene of the fight between Tuco and Mike was Mike's, which will result in a reduction to Tuco's sentence.


== Production ==
During the opening scene, Chuck and Rebecca discuss creating a signal based on an ear-tugging move made famous by Carol Burnett. Burnett herself would later join the series for the role of Marion during the show's final season.
