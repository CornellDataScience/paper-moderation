Loxwood Football Club is a football club based in Loxwood, West Sussex, England. Nicknamed "The Magpies" and affiliated to the Surrey County FA, they are currently members of the Southern Combination Premier Division and play at the Recreation Ground.


== History ==
The club was originally established in 1920. As Loxwood United they won the West Sussex League's Tony Kopp Cup in 1976–77. As Loxwood, they won the cup again in 1987–88 and were Division Two North champions the following season. Although the club subsequently folded, they reformed in 1997 and rejoined the West Sussex League, entering Division Five West. The club won the division in 1998–99 and were promoted to Division Four Central, which they won the following season. After being promoted from Division Three in 2000–01, the club were Division Two North champions in 2001–02.
Loxwood won the league's Centenary Cup in 2003–04 and retained it the following season, also winning the Malcolm Simmonds Memorial Cup. In 2006 they moved up to Division Three of the Sussex County League. They won Division Three in 2007–08, earning promotion to Division Two. In 2011–12 the club finished fifth and were set to be promoted due to third-place Dorking Wanderers failing ground grading requirements; however, the decision was overturned by the Football Association and Dorking were promoted. A third-place finish in Division Two in 2013–14 saw Loxwood promoted to Division One. In 2015 the league was renamed the Southern Combination, with Division One becoming the Premier Division.
