Inna is the recipient of five Balkan Music Awards, one European Border Breakers Award, three MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Romanian Act and fourteen Romanian Music Awards. Inna's debut studio album Hot, including her breakthrough single of the same name, was released in August 2009 and won the Romanian Music Award for Best Album.
