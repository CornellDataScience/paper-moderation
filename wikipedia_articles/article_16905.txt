== Biography ==
Baccouche studied in France during the 1950s. At the same time, he continued his political activities in the student union of the General Union of Tunisian Students. At the time, he was arrested in France, which was noted by Habib Bourguiba, who welcomed him in person after his release. During the 1960s, he was appointed governor and secretary of the coordination committee of Bizerte, which made him an ex-officio member of the central committee of the Destiny Socialist Party (PSD) after the Congress of Destiny held in Bizerte in 1964 and then he becomes successively governor of Sfax and Gabes. He was also mayor of Hammam Sousse from 1960 to 1964.
Having been dismissed as Governor in the case of Ahmed Ben Salah, he was finally acquitted by the High Court in charge of this case. He later became CEO of the National Fisheries Office and then adviser to the cabinet of Prime Minister Hédi Nouira. Fallen in disgrace after the Congress of Progress and Fidelity of 1979, he is sent as consul general in Lyon. From 1981 to 1982, Baccouche was ambassador to Bern and the Holy See (Vatican) before becoming ambassador to Algeria and director of the PSD. In 1987, he was appointed Minister of Social Affairs.
On 7 November 1987, he replaced Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who had just deposed President Bourguiba, as Prime Minister and Secretary General of the PSD. He is considered as the theorist of this "medical coup". On 27 September 1989, Hamed Karoui replaced him.
Baccouche was appointed by President Ben Ali as a member of the Chamber of Advisers when it was created in 2005. He was also a member of the central committee of the ruling Democratic Constitutional Rally, until the dissolution of this body on 20 January 2011, in the context of the Tunisian revolution.
He died on 21 January 2020, six days after his 90th birthday.
