== 2022 election results and lawsuit ==
The 2022 general election for the Illinois House of Representatives was held on November 8, 2022. Due to redistricting, Mazzochi ran for re-election in the 45th district. Her Democratic opponent in this election was Jenn Ladisch Douglass.
Mazzochi subsequently lost the election by 364 votes. After it became clear that she was facing electoral defeat, Mazzochi filed a lawsuit against incumbent DuPage County Clerk Jean Kaczmarek, who was also facing reelection in 2022. In the suit, Mazzochi accused the DuPage County Clerk of improperly verifying mail-in ballot signatures. Despite initially being granted a restraining order against Kaczmarek prohibiting the clerk "from using any signature on a Vote by Mail application in connection with validating signatures on the Vote by Mail ballot," the county's election results were certified on November 29, 2022. As of April 2023, Mazzochi has not publicly conceded the election or admitted defeat.
