=== Professional career ===
A shooting guard since his amateur days with RFM-Swift Corporation of the Philippine Basketball League, Agustin saw limited minutes during his rookie season with the grandslam-winning San Miguel Beermen in 1989, playing backup to his more illustrious teammates Samboy Lim and Elmer Reyes. However, beginning the 1990 season, he became a regular part of the Beermen's backcourt rotation with the departure of Reyes to expansion team Pop-Cola (RFM) and constant injuries to Lim and Hector Calma. 
Agustin won Most Improved Player in 1991 and Most Valuable Player the following year. He led the Beermen to three more titles in the early â€˜90s, including All-Filipino championships in 1992 and 1994, this time as a starter and a star. His time with the Beermen ended when he was traded to the Pop Cola Panthers for Nelson Asaytono.
Agustin was picked by Yeng Guiao to play for the Batang Red Bull Energizers during the 2000 expansion draft. He helped them win the 2001 Commissioner's Cup. In Game 6 of the finals, he made two clutch free throws that sealed the championship. He retired from the PBA after that. For a time, he played semi-professional basketball as an import in Brunei.


=== National team career ===
Agustin represented the Philippine national basketball team at the 1994 Asian Games.


=== Coaching career ===
He is the former head coach of the San Sebastian Golden Stags men's basketball team in the NCAA, having taken over from Jorge Gallent in 2009, and winning a championship in the same year.

During the 2011 PBA Governors' Cup, Agustin steered the team (then known as the Petron Blaze Boosters) to the championship, defeating the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters in seven games. He became the 9th coach in PBA history to win a title in his first year as head coach.
On July 25, 2013, San Miguel Corporation, owner of Petron Blaze Boosters and Barangay Ginebra San Miguel, announced the appointment of Agustin as interim coach of Barangay Ginebra San Miguel for the 2013 PBA Governor's Cup.
On January 5, 2015, Barangay Ginebra team manager Alfrancis Chua announced during the team's practice the reappointment of Agustin as head coach of the team.

Following his termination, he returned to San Miguel Beermen as an assistant coach.
