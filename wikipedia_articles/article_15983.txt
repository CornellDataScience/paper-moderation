In 2003, Lee married a college classmate, but got divorced after 5 months of marriage. It was reported that the reason for divorce was familial conflict, financial disputes, and differences in personality. However, it is said that the two did not register their marriage, so there were no issues to their family register.
In May 2010, he married a former news anchor and English interpreter, Lee Yoon-jin, 14 years his junior. Shortly after the May wedding ceremony, they announced that they were expecting their first child. Their daughter, Lee So-eul, was born on March 1, 2011.

On March 16, 2024, after 14 years of marriage, Lee's agency Y1 Entertainment confirmed reports of him and his wife's separation and that the couple were in the process of negotiating their divorce. They are currently involved in a divorce dispute, with his wife taking to social media to accuse the actor of being unfaithful and uncooperative with divorce proceedings. She also alleged that he is preventing her from seeing their son. Their son currently resides with Lee in Seoul, while their daughter resides with his wife in Bali. Through a statement released by his agency, Lee denied his estranged wife's claims.
