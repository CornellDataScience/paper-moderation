Her grandfather, David Wong was born in New Zealand to immigrants from Guangzhou. He became close friends with Roger Bailey, who would later go on to play 30 times for the New Zealand national rugby league team between 1961 and 1970.

Following primary school she attended Blockhouse Bay Intermediate.

She first came to notice in Sevens rugby when she played for the Auckland Under-18 Secondary Girls team in 2012, which led to her being selected in that same year for the Counties Manukau women's sevens team.
Initially she wasn’t considered for the New Zealand sevens team as the coach considered her to be too small.

She made her test debut for New Zealand as halfback when she came off the bench in the second half of their game at Orangetheory Stadium in Christchurch against Australia on 20 August 2022 when they won.
