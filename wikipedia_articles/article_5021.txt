== Background ==
On April 16, 2021, Wilson released her multi-track single "My Jesus" as the lead single to her upcoming studio album. She shared the story behind the song, saying: A few years ago, I went through a season of tragedy. My older brother, Jacob, who was my best friend and someone I looked up to in every way, lost his life in a car accident at the age of 23. That night I heard God's voice so clear and He spoke to me for the first time. He said, "Anne, are you going to trust me or not?" I answered, "Jesus, I trust you." In an instant, Jesus lifted the heavy weight off and told me that He would give me everything I need to get through this. Jesus began to show me that He was a personal God. When people hear to this song, I want them to feel that Jesus is personal; and while our stories may look different, the same Jesus that I call "My Jesus" can be your Jesus too.
