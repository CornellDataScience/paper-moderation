=== Site history, 1500–1795 ===
The entire eastern side of Naboløs (now Naboløs 1–5) was formerly made up of one large property. On 11 October 1504, it belonged to royal guard Peder Kempe. His widow Karina kept the property until her death after 24 July 1542. The property was then passed to their son Roidker Kempe. In 1558, it was acquired by mayor Anders Knudsen Skriver. His widow Sidsel Poulsdatter kept the property after his death in 1579. After her own death in 1611, it passed to their son Christoffer Andersen (died 22 November 1617), a barkeeper and councilman, who was married to Anne Marcusdatter Hess. After her death it was sold to the Crowbn (19 September 1626. On 15 October 1636, it was ceded to Wiwiche Kruse. In April 1648, he transferred it to the son Ulrich Christian Gyldenløve til Ulrichsholm. On 16 December 1649, he ceded the property to Johan Stenkull. By Raadstuedom of 12 December 1670, the property was ceded to Clavs Condevin. After his death, it passed to his heir Hans Johansen. On 30 January 1676, he presented it to councilman and co-owner Bartholomeus Jensen. On 15 March 1677, Bartholomeus Jensen ceded the property to etatsråd Jørgen Elers and his wife Margrete Vandal. Elers is remembered for founding Elers' Kollegium in Store Kannikestræde. Their property was listed in Copenhagen's first cadastre of 1689 as No. 19 in Strand Quarter. After his death on 17 September 1700, it passed to the University of Copenhagen. On 18 June 1707, it was sold to merchant Hans Jørgen Høserich. He owned the property until at least 1728.

The property was again listed as No. 19 in the new cadastre of 1756. It was at that time owned by post inspector Peter Bech.
The property was later acquired by wallpaper manufacturer and royal agent Abraham Moses Henriques (1721–1802). In October 1770, one of the apartments was let out to treasurer at Kurantbanken Rasmus Møller. The annual rent was 210 Danish rigsdaler plus a minor contribution to the annual property taxes. Møller and his family lived in the building until the autumn of 1775. They moved after buying a property in Laksegade. Møller was later convicted of embezzlement against the bank.
Abraham Moses Henriques' property was home to 25 residents in five households at the 1787 census. The owner resided in the building with his third wife Sara, their eight-year-old daughter, seven children from his second marriage (aged 13 to 21) and two maids.

Maria Cathrine Tykøv, widow of a gunmaker at the Royal Arsenal, resided in the building with her two daughters (aged 11 and 12).


=== Hans Ondrup and the new building ===
The property was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795, together with most of the other buildings in the area. The fire site was acquired by master builder Hans Christian Ondrup (1751-1814). He divided it into three separate properties. The corner building was as No. 16A constructed by him in 1796–97. It was followed by No. 19B (now Naboløs 3 in 1798 and finally No. 19C at the corner with Læderstræde in 1798-99.
