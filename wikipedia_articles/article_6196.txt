A leap year starting on Friday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Friday 1 January and ends on Saturday 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are CB. The most recent year of such kind was 2016 and the next one will be 2044 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise, 2000 and 2028 in the obsolete Julian calendar.
Any leap year that starts on Friday has only one Friday the 13th: the only one in this leap year occurs in May. 
In this type of year, all dates (except 29 February) fall on their respective weekdays the maximal 58 times in the 400 year Gregorian calendar cycle. Leap years starting on Sunday share this characteristic.

=== Gregorian Calendar ===
Leap years that begin on Friday, along with those starting on Sunday, occur most frequently: 15 of the 97 (≈ 15.46%) total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Thus, their overall occurrence is 3.75% (15 out of 400).
For this kind of year, the ISO week 10 (which begins March 7) and all subsequent ISO weeks occur later than in all other leap years.


=== Julian Calendar ===
Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Friday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e. in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year's position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1).
