The X164 GL-Class is a full-sized luxury crossover SUV produced by Mercedes-Benz, from 2006 to 2012.


== Development and launch ==
The X164 GL-Class debuted at the 2006 North American International Auto Show, and deliveries commenced on September in Europe. Around US$600,000,000 was invested in the Mercedes Alabama plant in preparation for the production of vehicles including the X164 GL-Class.
Unlike most three-row luxury SUVs at the time, the GL-Class is based on an elongated and widened version of the M-Class platform, instead of the body-on-frame construction found on vehicles such as the Lexus LX and Cadillac Escalade. The Guardian said in their review of the GL that "even in places where SUVs are rife, it appears comically out of scale" and described the suspension as "caramel-smooth at pace, but bouncy as a Kiddie Castle on speed bumps" before going on to say "the chrome Mercedes badge on the GL's grille is frying pan-sized and, cutely, right at the height where the head would generally be on a standing four-year-old". GL 500 models are badged as GL 550 in the United States.


== Equipment ==
All models feature leather electric seats, an automatic climate control system, 19-inch alloy wheels, 4MATIC all-wheel drive, air suspension (adjustable by up to 307 mm), and a 7-speed 7G-Tronic automatic transmission. GL-Class models are also optionally available with a tyre pressure monitoring system, DAB digital radio, reversing camera, and rear seat infotainment screens. Grand Edition models were also offered from 2011, and feature a redesigned front bumper, taller grille with three slats, 20-inch AMG alloy wheels, bi-xenon headlamps, and a two-tone interior.
