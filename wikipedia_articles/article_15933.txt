The 2020 Arizona Wildcats football team represented the University of Arizona in the 2020 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Arizona was led by third-year head coach Kevin Sumlin, in the Wildcats' 121st season. The Wildcats played in the South Division (11th season) of the Pac-12 Conference, and played their home games at Arizona Stadium in Tucson, Arizona (93rd season).
On August 11, the Pac-12 Conference initially canceled all fall sports competitions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 24, the conference announced that a six-game conference-only season would begin on November 6, with the Pac-12 Championship Game to be played December 18. Teams not selected for the championship game would be seeded to play a seventh game.
On December 12, 2020, Sumlin was fired after three seasons following a 70–7 loss to ASU in the Territorial Cup on December 11, 2020. He finished at Arizona with an overall record of 9–20 and 6–17 against the Pac-12. On December 23, 2020, the University of Arizona hired Jedd Fisch as the 32nd head coach.
