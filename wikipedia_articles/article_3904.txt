"(Feels Like) Heaven" is a song by Scottish new wave band Fiction Factory, which was released in 1983 as the second single from their debut studio album Throw the Warped Wheel Out (1984). The track was a hit in Switzerland, reaching #2 on the singles chart. In the UK, it peaked at #6. Other chart positions include #10 in Germany, #12 in The Netherlands, #14 in Sweden and #20 in Austria. The song is a regular feature on 1980s and new wave compilation albums.
Fiction Factory had no other notable successes beyond "(Feels Like) Heaven", marking the band as a one-hit wonder.
The song was written by Kevin Patterson and Eddie Jordan shortly after they had formed Fiction Factory with Chic Medley. The lyric has been described by the band as "an anti-love song", while recognising that it has come to have a different meaning for different people.
The song was referenced in Ariel Pink's 2017 song "Feels Like Heaven".


== Critical reception ==
On its release, Ian Birch of Smash Hits wrote, "Imagine a smattering of H2O, China Crisis and The Lotus Eaters with a clean-cut production. One to watch in '84." Tony Jasper of Music Week noted the song "has a fetching feel with a good blend of vocals and backing track". Frank Edmonds of the Bury Free Press gave the song an 8 out of 10 rating and described it as a "truly impressive and pleasing little number, with a relaxed, catchy melody". In the US, David Okamoto of The Tampa Tribune described it as "the song Spandau Ballet would kill for" and "one of the prettiest singles of the year".
