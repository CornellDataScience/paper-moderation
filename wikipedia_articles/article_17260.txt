== History ==

The first non-Native American settlers in Rochester were a group of five farming families, who all hailed from the town of Rochester, Vermont after which they gave their new settlement its name. These were "Yankee" settlers, which is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the colonial era. Correspondingly they were members of the Congregationalist Church and were staunch abolitionists. When they arrived in what is now Rochester there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. They laid out post routes, built roads, constructed farms and government buildings all within the first few months of settling in what is now Rochester.  Due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had become Baptists or converted to either Presbyterianism or Methodism before coming to what is now Walworth County, Wisconsin. 
Rochester holds one of the oldest continuously run Memorial Day observances in the nation, having held its first in 1867.
The Village was incorporated in 1912. The Village and Town of Rochester consolidated in 2008.
