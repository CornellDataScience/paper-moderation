== History ==
New Eltham station was opened as Pope Street Station in April 1878, twelve years after the opening of the Dartford Loop Line.  The station was renamed New Eltham in 1886 although Pope Street was retained as a suffix until 1927.  It had a goods yard on the up side which closed in 1963 and eventually became a car park, and a signal box just beyond the western end of the down platform.  In 1955 the platforms were extended to take ten carriage trains. In the same year the signal box was taken out of use and demolished.  The up side booking office was rebuilt in 1988.


== Location ==
The station is located in New Eltham in a shallow cutting near the crossroads of Footscray Road and Avery Hill Road.
