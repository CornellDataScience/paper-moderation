Us Moderates (Italian: Noi moderati, NM) is a centrist political party in Italy, led by Maurizio Lupi.
The party has had several associated members and regional partners. Most of NM's members and electes are former members of Forza Italia.


== History ==
Us Moderates was launched as an electoral joint list within the centre-right coalition in the 2022 Italian general election, which obtained 0.9% of the vote, seven deputies and two senators. NM was originally composed of four founding members: Us with Italy (NcI), Italy in the Centre (IaC), the Union of the Centre (UdC) and Coraggio Italia (CI). After the election, NM formed parliamentary groups both in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate (Civics of Italy), thanks to the influx of some elects from the Brothers of Italy and the alliance with the Associative Movement of Italians Abroad (MAIE).
In May 2023 NM evolved into a unitary party, causing the splits of CI and the UdC. Maurizio Lupi, leader of NcI, became NM's leader and president, while Giovanni Toti, leader of IaC, has served as president of the party's national council since the party's first congress, held in October 2023. In January 2024, Italy of Values (IdV), formerly aligned with the centre-left, joined and its leader Ignazio Messina became NM's spokesperson. In February 2024 UdC leader Lorenzo Cesa aligned his party with the League and subsequently left NM's group in the Chamber.
In the 2024 European Parliament election NM ran with Forza Italia (FI), obtaining 9.6% of the vote.
In September 2024 Mara Carfagna, Mariastella Gelmini and Giusy Versace, all three former FI members who had joined Action in 2022, formed an association named "Popular Centre". In October they officially joined NM, as well as its parliamentary groups in the Chamber and the Senate.
In November 2024 NM changed its symbol, adding to its name also "Populars for Europe", and it was announced that the party is seeking to join the European People's Party in the coming months.
