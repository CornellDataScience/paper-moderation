== Etymology ==
The village is most likely named after their leading industry, the mining of iron ore as ruda means "ore". Kalmerana or kameralnym, means "intimate/cozy", commonly translated to "chamber" and likely derives from how the village is situated among the forests in a very peaceful place far from civilization.


== History ==


=== 14th century ===
In 1372, Paszko Tresta of Brzany, Gedcycze allowed the brothers Błażej and Filip from Tworkowa to establish the village of Ruda Kameralna south of Filipowice in the woods on the Świdnik Swamp.
Iron ore deposits were found in the area and exploited on a large scale in the Middle Ages. The ore was melted in cooking mugs and inverted in nearby Paleśnica. Salmon from the nearby stream was smoked and chopped and the water was used in the hammer mill to refine the iron they mined.


=== 17th century ===
In 1655, Sweden invaded Poland in the Deluge and Ruda Kameralna remained under Swedish rule until 1660 after the Polish King John II Casimir renounced his claim to the Swedish crown.


=== 18th century ===
In 1772, the village came under Austria-Hungarian rule and was considered part of historic Galicia. Although a village comprised completely of Poles, it was to remain part of Austria until the end of World War I. By 1795 Poland was no longer an independent Polish state and was partitioned between Brandenburg-Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy and Russia.


=== 20th century ===
In the aftermath of World War I, the Polish people rose up in the Greater Poland Uprising on December 27, 1918. The fighting continued until June 28, 1919, when the Treaty of Versailles was signed and the village became part of the new Republic of Poland with the rest of West Galicia.
In 1939, Germany and the USSR invaded Poland and the country was again partitioned between the two nations. The town of Ruda Kameralna became part of Germany with its residents deprived of their voting rights and banned from non-Nazi political parties. They would remain under Germany rule until the end of World War II in 1945 when Poland once again was its own independent nation.
In 1971 a fire burned down the brick and mortar St. Mary Trinity Chapel. It was rebuilt the same year.


=== 21st century ===
On July 23, 2001, there was flooding after torrential rains. The Rudzanka, a stream running through the village, turned into a great mass of brownish water that destroyed roads, houses, and farm buildings and forced the evacuation of the population.
