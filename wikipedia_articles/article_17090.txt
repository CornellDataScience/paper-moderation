The 1991 Seattle Seahawks season was the team's 16th season with the National Football League (NFL). The 1991 season was the last season for head coach Chuck Knox, who left to become head coach of the Los Angeles Rams while president and general manager Tom Flores replaced him.
The Seahawks defense, led by future hall of Famer Cortez Kennedy, finished 8th on the season in both yards and scoring. This season was the last time a team played the same team in back to back games until the 2021 season when the Cleveland Browns played the Baltimore Ravens back to back, with a bye week in between.
