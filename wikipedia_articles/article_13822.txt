"SOS" is the first posthumous single by Swedish DJ Avicii, featuring co-productions from Albin Nedler and Kristoffer Fogelmark, and vocals by American singer Aloe Blacc. It was released on 10 April 2019 as the lead single of Avicii's posthumous third studio album, Tim (2019). The single is also his second number-one (and his first posthumously charted single to reach number-one), as well as Blacc's first, on Billboard's Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, in its 1 June 2019 issue.
The song was produced by Albin Nedler, Kristoffer Fogelmark, and Avicii. It features an interpolation of "No Scrubs" by TLC, written by Tameka Cottle, Kandi Burruss, and Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs.
The song was released alongside a video featuring comments on the Avicii Memory Board, as well as a behind-the-scenes video that was released two hours prior. It debuted at number one on the singles chart in Sweden on two days of sales.


== Background ==
The song was completed by a team of writers and producers following Avicii's death in April 2018. It was said to be "75–80% done" at the time of his death.
Co-producers Kristoffer Fogelmark and Albin Nedler confirmed that after Avicii's death, they received the MIDI file for the song that he had produced, and said that all the sounds and notes in the song were from Avicii himself without any additional production. The only additional production done on the track was for Aloe Blacc's vocals.
Though Avicii had suggested Aloe Blacc as a potential singer for the song, Blacc recorded his vocals after Avicii's death.
