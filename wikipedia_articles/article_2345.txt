== Reception ==
Mark Schwed, in his article published in the Winston-Salem Journal, said he liked it. He noted that the director "does a beautiful job of capturing the feeling of the people the place and the time as it was framed in the novel by Ernest J Gaines."
Ron Weiskind in his review published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette thought it was stirring and thoughtful. He wrote that "the film's laconic pace seems oddly casual and desultory at first. But "Gathering" slowly peels away at scabs of anger and hurt and prejudice to reveal the effects racism has had on its characters and, by extension, on the rest of us." Of the cast he said "this gathering of old men is filled with talent."
