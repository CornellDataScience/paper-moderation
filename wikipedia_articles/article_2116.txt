High Peak is a local government district with borough status in Derbyshire, England, covering a high moorland plateau in the Dark Peak area of the Peak District National Park. The district stretches from Holme Moss in the north to Sterndale Moor in the south, and from Hague Bar in the west to Bamford in the east. The population of the borough taken at the 2011 Census was 90,892. The borough is unusual in having two administrative centres for its council, High Peak Borough Council; the offices are in Buxton and Glossop. Other towns include Chapel-en-le-Frith, Hadfield, New Mills and Whaley Bridge. 
High Peak was the name of a hundred of the ancient county of Derbyshire covering roughly the same area as the current district. It may have derived its name from the ancient Forest of High Peak, a royal hunting reserve administered by William Peverel, a favourite of William I, who was based at Peak Castle. High Peak contains much of the Peak District National Park. The district contains the highest point in Derbyshire, Kinder Scout, which stands at 636m (2,087 ft) above sea level. Its settlements act as commuter centres for people who work in the surrounding counties and other parts of Derbyshire, owing to its proximity to Cheshire, Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, Staffordshire and West Yorkshire.


== Creation ==
The borough was formed on 1 April 1974, covering the area of six former districts, which were abolished:

Buxton Municipal Borough
Chapel-en-le-Frith Rural District
Glossop Municipal Borough
New Mills Urban District
Tintwistle Rural District (which had been in the administrative county of Cheshire)
Whaley Bridge Urban District


== Neighbouring districts ==
The borough adjoins the metropolitan boroughs of Sheffield and Barnsley in South Yorkshire, Kirklees in West Yorkshire, the districts of Derbyshire Dales, Cheshire East and Staffordshire Moorlands, and the Stockport, Tameside and Oldham metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester. The Metropolitan Borough of Oldham is only bordered by high moorland near Black Hill and is not accessible by road.
