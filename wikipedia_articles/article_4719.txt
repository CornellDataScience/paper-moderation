The lottery determined the team that will obtain the first pick in the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their cumulative final rankings in the previous season with heavier weight from the results of the Philippine Cup.

Lottery teams—green: 67% chance; blue: 33% chance
The lottery was held on July 1, 2014, before the start of the Game 1 of the 2014 PBA Governors' Cup Finals at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. The GlobalPort Batang Pier won the rights to the first overall selection against the Meralco Bolts. Due to a previous transaction, the draft rights of Meralco belongs to the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters from the Ronjay Buenafe trade on August 28, 2012.


=== Controversy ===
The matter on how the draft lottery is conducted became the subject of criticism from the fans and from Rain or Shine coach Yeng Guiao for lacking credibility and transparency. The league used three balls (two represents GlobalPort and one for Meralco) and were placed in a white box. Commissioner Chito Salud placed the balls inside the white box and drew the winner of the draft, without removing his hand first after placing the balls in the box. A formal request by Rain or Shine for a re-draw was sent to the league's board of governors. On July 4, Commissioner Salud apologized on the crudeness of the draft lottery procedures; however, he insisted that it was an honest mistake on their part by not checking out the minor details of the lottery and its proceedings.
During an emergency meeting of the Board of Governors, it was decided that no re-draw will be held after Rain or Shine and the board accepted the public apology of Commissioner Salud. The league's board and management committee will review the procedures of the lottery draw to prevent the issues raised to happen again. Since then, the league no longer holds a draft lottery. The team with the worst rankings in the previous season is now directly given the first overall pick.
