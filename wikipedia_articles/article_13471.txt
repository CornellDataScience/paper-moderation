== History ==
The Red Bluff Irrigation System was constructed in 1896 by Marcus H. Townsend, W. T. Burford, and T. A. Hill to draw rice farmers to the region. By 1901, several local farmers were cultivating rice. Ed R. Frnka moved the first building on the townsite in 1901 as well; Townsend offered Frnka the property for his building. In memory of Townsend's friend and Houston lawyer Hiram Morgan Garwood, the community was renamed Garwood. The first chapel and post office in the village were founded in 1901. An extra structure was relocated to Garwood in 1902 and put to use as a hotel. Garwood participated in a land advertising scam in 1906. Agents would give photos of crops, such as orange groves, to their victims that had been taken somewhere else but were purportedly from Colorado County. Unseen, the land was purchased, and most purchasers departed upon seeing Garwood and the surrounding acreage. 1909–1912 saw Garwood publish two newspapers. In 1910, there was a bank there, and 500 people were living in Garwood. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway served the town, which had 750 persons by 1915. The majority of the establishments on the east side of the main street were destroyed by fire in 1922. After these were restored, the town expanded gradually. Garwood recorded twelve establishments and a 975-person population estimate in 1990 and 2000, with 37 businesses. It stayed at 975 in 2010 then went down to 510 in 2020.
