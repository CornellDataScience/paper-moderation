== History ==


=== Establishment and Development ===
This public university in the Uva Province of Sri Lanka was founded on 1 July 2005, to address the educational needs of the region. The campus occupies 35 acres of land, with the original plan covering 59 acres due to the challenging mountainous terrain. The Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) oversaw the design and development of the campus with cabinet approval in October 2004.
The inception of UWU was the result of collaborative efforts, including an influential report by Professor H.P.M. Gunasena and a concept paper drafted by a Coordinating Committee led by Mr. Chandra Embuldeniya. The University Grants Commission (UGC) endorsed this innovative model for university establishment, and Mr. Embuldeniya was appointed Vice Chancellor in July 2005.
Core facilities, including lecture halls and computer labs, were operational by December 2006, marking the completion of various blocks and the Administration Block, despite facing obstacles like legal issues and relocation delays.
President Chandrika Kumaratunga formally recognized the university's establishment in 2007, and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa officially inaugurated the campus on 5 August 2009.


=== Achievements and Growth ===
UWU is the 14th National University in the Sri Lankan State University system and is known as the nation's first all-entrepreneurial institution.
