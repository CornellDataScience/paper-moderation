=== College ===
Hyman originally committed to play ice hockey for Princeton University during the 2010–11 season. However, he decommitted after Princeton Tigers head coach Guy Gadowsky left the school to start the Division I hockey program at Pennsylvania State University. Following Gadowsky to Penn State was not an option, as the program did not have a varsity team at the time. In May 2011, Hyman was offered an athletic scholarship and committed to play for the University of Michigan for the 2011–12 season.
During his freshman season for the Michigan Wolverines, Hyman recorded 2 goals and 7 assists in 41 games.

Hyman was selected as the 2014 Bates/Deskins Award Winner, an honour bestowed upon the University of Michigan's Top Junior Student Athlete.

In his senior season, Hyman was named alternate captain. He was Michigan's leading scorer, and the Big Ten Scoring Champion, setting a new record with 54 points, scoring 22 goals and 32 assists in only 37 games. Hyman became the first Michigan player to record 20 goals in a season since Louie Caporusso, and the first player to record 50 points or more since Carl Hagelin during the 2009–10 season. Hyman led the team with 17 multiple-point games, including six games with three or more points. On October 24, 2014, Hyman recorded a career-high five points, and his first career hat-trick against the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
In December 2014, Hyman was named to the 50th Great Lakes Invitational Tournament team, where he scored both game-winning goals against Michigan Technological University and Michigan State University to help lead Michigan to its 16th Tournament Title.
Following an outstanding senior season with the Wolverines, Hyman was named to the 2014–15 All-Big Ten First Team, and named an AHCA First Team All-American. Hyman was also named a top-ten finalist for the Hobey Baker Award. He was also selected as the SB Nation College Hockey Big Ten Media Most Valuable Player.
On March 27, 2015, Hyman received the 2015 All-American Athlete Award by The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NCSA) and EAS Sports Nutrition. The award recognized Hyman's athletic accomplishments and his dedication to strength and conditioning.

On June 11, 2015, Hyman was named to the 2015 Capital One Academic All-America Division I Men's At-Large team, as selected by CoSIDA. Hyman was the second ice hockey player at Michigan to be named an Academic All-America honoree, following Jeff Jillson in 2001, and the first to be named First Team Academic All American.
On June 22, 2015, the University of Michigan Athletic Department named Hyman the 2014–15 Michigan Athlete of the Year. Hyman was the third ice hockey player to receive the honour, following Brendan Morrison in 1997 and Kevin Porter in 2008.


=== Professional ===
Hyman was drafted 123rd overall by the Florida Panthers in the 2010 NHL entry draft. At the conclusion of his college career, the Panthers offered Hyman an NHL contract, but Hyman announced his intent not to sign with the Panthers, and opted for free agency.


==== Toronto Maple Leafs (2015–2021) ====
On June 19, 2015, Hyman's playing rights were acquired by the Toronto Maple Leafs from the Florida Panthers in exchange for centre Greg McKegg and a conditional draft pick (conditions not met), ahead of his planned July 1, 2015, free agency. On June 23, Hyman signed a two-year, entry-level contract with Toronto.

Hyman made his professional debut for the Maple Leafs' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, on October 9, 2015, where he recorded his first professional point, an assist on a Byron Froese goal in the second period. On November 7, Hyman recorded his first professional goal, a short-handed goal against Matt O'Connor of the Binghamton Senators.
On February 29, 2016, Hyman was recalled by the Toronto Maple Leafs. Prior to being recalled, he recorded 13 goals and 20 assists in 54 games for the Marlies that season and led the AHL in short-handed goals. He made his NHL debut in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning later that night, recording 15:58 of ice time, 22 shifts, two shots and one hit. He scored his first career NHL goal one week later on March 7 against Chad Johnson of the Buffalo Sabres.
On March 31, 2016, Hyman was loaned to the Marlies in preparation for the AHL Calder Cup playoffs. Considered favourites to win the Calder Cup championship, the team was eliminated in the third round. Hyman contributed 6 points in the team's 15-game run. Hyman played every game despite suffering an injury (broken nose) in a game against the Hershey Bears.
On October 11, 2016, Hyman earned a permanent spot on the big club, and he was included on the 2016–17 regular season 100th Anniversary Centennial team opening day roster for the Toronto Maple Leafs. He dressed for the season opener on October 12, against the Ottawa Senators, on a line with fellow rookies Auston Matthews and William Nylander. In the first period of play, Hyman assisted on Auston Matthews' first-ever NHL goal.

During the 2016–17 NHL season a number of Toronto Maple Leafs team records were either tied or broken by Hyman. On February 6, 2017, Hyman scored his third short-handed goal of the season, surpassing the previous Maple Leafs record for number of short-handed goals scored by a rookie which had been held by Gus Mortson since 1946–47. At six games with an assist, Hyman also tied for the most consecutive games with an assist by a rookie with Dan Daoust, Bob Nevin, and Frank Nigro. On March 28, 2017, when playing the Florida Panthers, Hyman set the Toronto Maple Leafs record for most short-handed goals in a single season by a rookie with four.
On March 15, 2016, Hyman scored his first multi-point game. On October 7, 2017, he recorded another multi-point game with two points in an eventual 8–5 victory over the New York Rangers.
On July 5, 2017, Hyman signed a four-year, $9 million contract extension with the Maple Leafs.
Hyman skated on the Maple Leafs' top line during the 2017–18 season. He recorded career-highs in goals, and assist and points. On December 29, 2017, Hyman scored his fifth career shorthanded goal. The goal is the third-most by a Maple Leafs' player during their first three NHL season, behind only Rick Vaive (seven) and Lanny McDonald (six). The Maple Leafs qualified for the postseason for a second straight year, falling in the first round in seven games to the Boston Bruins.
Hyman missed the beginning of the 2019–20 season after recovering from Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery. He made his season debut on November 13 in a 5–4 loss to the New York Islanders. Hyman finished the season scoring 21 goals and 37 points in just 51 games.
Hyman was named an Alternate Captain for the Toronto Maple Leafs prior to the start of the 2020–21 season.


==== Edmonton Oilers (2021–present) ====
Following the end of his RFA contract, Hyman initially hoped to remain in Toronto with the Maple Leafs. However, after preliminary negotiations it became clear that the team's salary cap considerations put a deal out of reach. Following that, he entered into negotiations with the Edmonton Oilers. On July 28, 2021, Hyman signed a seven-year, $38.5 million contract with the Oilers. Hyman cited the opportunity to play with stars like Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl as one of the biggest draws of the team on signing.

Making his debut with the Oilers in the October 15 season opener against the Vancouver Canucks, Hyman scored a power play goal. Hyman scored 11 goals and 8 assists in his first 26 games, before missing three games after a minor shoulder injury resulting from an altercation with Carolina Hurricanes defenceman Brady Skjei. One of the games he missed was against the Leafs, to his disappointment, before the league itself took a pause as a result of the Omicron variant. After an excellent start to the season for the Oilers, they began suffering a marked decline in results, culminating in a 2–11–2 stretch of games in December and January. By early February they had dropped out of a playoff spot. Amidst extensive media discussion of the Oilers' lack of depth scoring and questionable goaltending, general manager Ken Holland fired coach Dave Tippett and replaced him with Jay Woodcroft, previously the coach of the Oilers AHL affiliate Bakersfield Condors. Woodcroft's early experimentation with the lineup included playing Hyman more on the top lines with McDavid and Draisaitl. The Oilers recovered their form under Woodcroft, finishing the season in second place in the Pacific Division to qualify for the playoffs after posting the third-best points percentage in the league after the coaching change with a 26–9–3 record. Hyman had a career best regular season with 27 goals and 27 assists. The Oilers faced the Los Angeles Kings in the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs, winning the series in seven games and allowing Hyman to advance to the second round for the first time in his career. The Oilers drew the Calgary Flames in the second round, the first playoff "Battle of Alberta" in 31 years. Hyman had an outstanding series, scoring 6 goals and 8 points in 5 games, setting a franchise record being the only Oiler to score a goal in every game of a playoff series. The Oilers advanced to the Western Conference Final, meeting the top-seeded Colorado Avalanche, where the Oilers were swept. Hyman had the best playoff run of his career, scoring 11 goals and 16 points in 16 games. In the 2022–23 season he achieved a career high 83 points, and in 2023–24 he scored a career-high 54 goals (which was third best in the NHL).


== International play ==

In 2010, as a 17-year-old underage player, Hyman served as assistant captain and represented Canada in the U20 Three Nations tournament in Norrtälje, Sweden. He was named game MVP against Finland, after scoring two goals in the game. He finished the tournament with three goals and one assist in four games.
Hyman represented Canada East at the 2010 World Junior A Challenge. He was named MVP of the game against Russia. He was one of the tournament's leading scorers recording two goals and three assists in five games, and won a silver medal.
In July 2013, Hyman served as an alternate captain representing Canada at the 2013 Maccabiah Games held in Israel, where he recorded three goals and three assists in two games and won a gold medal.
