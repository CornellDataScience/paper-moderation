== History ==

The hospital, which replaced the Women's Hospital in Catharine Street, the Liverpool Maternity Hospital, and Mill Road Maternity Hospital (formerly Mill Road Infirmary) in a single new building in Crown Street, was designed by the Percy Thomas Partnership and was constructed in red brick with white cladding and light blue metal roofs. It was officially opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in November 1995. A sculpture entitled Mother and Child was erected outside the main entrance to the hospital in 1999 by Terry McDonald.
Liverpool Women's Hospital was investigated in 2018 as part of the investigation into the Countess of Chester Hospital baby murders, as perpetrator Lucy Letby had previously worked there. Following Letby's conviction in 2023, the police announced they would be investigating her activity at Liverpool Women's hospital as part of an overall investigation into Letby's entire career.

On 14 November 2021, police were called at approximately 11:00 a.m. UTC following reports of a car explosion. The building went into lockdown and was cordoned off by the police; a man died and another was injured. Counter-terrorism police lead the investigation. The dead man was the passenger in the taxi and that the injured man was the driver.


== Hospitals merged into Liverpool Women's Hospital ==
Mill Road Hospital was erected by the West Derby Union Board of Guardians as a workhouse infirmary to care for the sick poor. It was re-named Mill Road Infirmary by 1891, and a new nurses home was built. It stayed as a general hospital until after the Second World War when it became a maternity hospital called Mill Road Maternity Hospital. This largely closed in 1993, and in 1995 it was one of the hospitals which merged to form Liverpool Women's Hospital.

Senior nursing staff of Mill Road infirmary included three women who had trained at The London Hospital under Matron Eva Luckes.
