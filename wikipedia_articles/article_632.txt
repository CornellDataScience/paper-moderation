Arnold Böcklin is a typeface for display use that was designed in 1904 by Schriftgiesserei Otto Weisert foundry. It was named in memory of Arnold Böcklin, a Swiss symbolist painter who died in 1901.
Probably the best-known Art Nouveau typeface, the font had a renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the general Art Nouveau revival in popular design. Its influence can be seen in the work of illustrators such as Roger Dean and the Stuckist artist Paul Harvey. Its also popularly seen on Donovan's 1960's album cover.


== Design characteristics ==
Arnold Böcklin features a traditional serif structure with high contrast between thick and thin strokes, giving it a timeless aesthetic suitable for both display and text settings. The typeface incorporates soft curves and sharp angles, creating a harmonious balance that enhances readability. Its proportions are carefully crafted to evoke a sense of stability and refinement, making it popular for a variety of print and digital applications.

Arnold Böcklin is commonly used in editorial design, branding, and advertising. Its versatility allows it to function effectively in both large display settings, such as headlines and posters, and smaller text sizes, including body copy and captions. The typeface has been embraced by various industries, including publishing, fashion, and corporate branding.
