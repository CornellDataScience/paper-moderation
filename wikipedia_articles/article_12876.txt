Ortiz decided to take a break from the Cuban national team after the Olympics, but when she tried to return to the team she received a two years penalty from the Cuban authorities. After the Olympic disappointment, she dedicated herself to modeling in Italy.


=== 2010 ===
Even when she received offers from Italian volleyball clubs, her agent Alexei Kunyshev recommended the Russian league to her. After the two-year break from volleyball, Ortiz travelled in June 2010 to Russia to the Siberian city of Omsk, training during the Omichka Omsk club's vacation time in order to get in shape before August, when the contracts were going to be held. She was introduced to the press as an Omichka club member for the 2010/10 season in an open training session on 19 August 2010. She played the second round of the 2010/11 GM Capital Challenge Cup, with Omichka winning in December the home match to the Azerbaijani club Lokomotiv Baku, 3-2. However, they lost the away match 0-3 and the golden set, ending their European Cups participation. She led her club with 18 points in the lost 0-3 to Dinamo Moscow, with her first match in Siberian severe weather at under 30 degrees below zero. Because of the weather the club's doctor asked her not to play, and Ortiz was sidelined for the last 2010 match against Dinamo Krasnodar due to acute respiratory distress syndrome, but she opted to stay with the team in the warm up zone and cheer during the match.


=== 2011 ===
After Ortiz played nine matches with the Omsk club, averaging 4.31 points per set and ranking seventh in the Russian Superliga, she moved in February to the Azerbaijani club Igtisadchi Baku. She ended the season by winning the Azerbaijan Super League bronze medal.
She signed with the Russian club Dinamo Moscow for the 2011/12 season. She expressed that she was honored to play with this club and had many goals, including winning the CEV Champions League. However, due to low performance, the club's administration decided to hire Angelina Grün in her place to stay on court along with Eva Yaneva because of the local league restrictions. Ortiz agreed to continue playing in the 2011–12 CEV Champions League, and also helped them to win the 2011 Russian Cup.


=== 2012 ===
Ortiz played the CEV Champions League and contributed with her club to win their pool first place in the preliminary round. They reached the CEV Champions League Knockout stage, where they lost 2-3 to the Italian club MC-Carnaghi Villa Cortese in Italy, and 0-3 in Moscow, to end her club's European Championship and her time with the Moscow club. The club tried to help Ortiz to find a new club for the rest of the season.
She later signed for the Turkish club Sarıyer Belediyesi for the 2012/13 season. The contract was questioned within the Sarıyer Municipal Assembly, when a local lawmaker asked for clarification about the Ortiz contract worth US$1.5 million and the Brazilian Olympic player Raquel Silva US$1.25 million at the time. He showed in the assembly and published in the municipality website pictures of Ortiz in a bikini. He asked if they had come to Turkey for modelling, and questioned where the funding came from. The club president said that she had signed for US$100,000 just to play volleyball, and that the funding would be contributed by the club sponsors on a monthly basis for 10 months, starting in September 2012.
Ortiz won the first International Bosphorus Volleyball Tournament organized for her club as a warm up before the season's start. She started the season as her club's scoring leader, but decreased her performance because she was injured.


=== 2013-2015 ===
She claimed that she really enjoyed playing with Sarıyer, focused on reaching a league's top six ranking to qualify for the European Cups. She said that she looked forward playing with them the next season. However, she announced her retirement after that season, due to suffering a knee injury. She cited family reasons for making a pause in her career in July 2013, but nonetheless, she supported her former teammates in the Sarıyer's opening ceremony of the 2013-2014 season.
She unsuccessfully tried a return in October, with Sarıyer releasing the Ukrainian Mariia Voitenko, club's previous signing, to make room for her. Instead, she dedicated herself to modeling again.
She tried to return for the 2014/15 season with Sarıyer, signing after having spent one year out, and the medical check was approved, but the Brazilian Ana Paula Lopes Ferreira was transferred in her place when she suffered from injuries to her knee cartilage.
