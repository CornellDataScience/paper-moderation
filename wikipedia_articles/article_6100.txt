=== Federal judicial service ===
On April 29, 2022, U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper recommended Sundeep Addy, Gordon Gallagher and Crews for two vacancies on the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. On February 22, 2023, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate Crews to serve as a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. 
On February 27, 2023, his nomination was sent to the Senate. President Biden nominated Crews to a seat being vacated by Judge Raymond P. Moore, who subsequently assumed senior status on June 20, 2023. Crews was the third magistrate judge to be nominated for a district court vacancy in Colorado. 
On March 22, 2023, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his confirmation hearing, he was unable to answer a question by Senator John Kennedy, in which the senator asked him to define a Brady motion, which is a tenet of criminal law.
On May 11, 2023, his nomination was reported out of committee by a party line 11–10 vote. On January 10, 2024, the United States Senate invoked cloture on his nomination by a 51–47 vote, with Senator Kyrsten Sinema voting against the motion to invoke cloture on his nomination.
