== Sport administration career ==
In 1983, McCullough was the inaugural Chairperson of the North Queensland Sports Foundation.  He held this position until 1986. From 1989 to 1999, he was President of  Wheelchair Sports Australia (now Australian Athletes with a Disability). In 1994, he was appointed President of the Australian Paralympic Federation. He took over the Federation at a time when it had limited funds and near bankruptcy. McCullough put in place a marketing and fundraising strategy that aimed to raise $1.5 million for the team to compete at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games. An outcome of this approach was the Motor Accident Authority of New South Wales providing $100,000 and employment for 10 athletes in the promotion of disabilities through motor vehicle accidents.  Whilst President, he negotiated an agreement with the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee so that the Federation received $5.5 million for marketing rights over the four years leading to the 2000 Sydney Paralympics. These financial arrangements coupled with the Australian Governments Paralympic Preparation Program led to the Australian team finishing 2nd on the medal tally at the 1996 Atlanta Games. McCullogh was replaced as President in 1997 by Marie Little. He was a Director of the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (1997–2000).
McCullough’s contribution to international sport included his roles as President of the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (1996–2001), International Paralympic Committee Executive (1996–2002), and representative of the Paralympics in the IOC Evaluation Commission for the 2008 Bidding Cities (2001). In 2001, he was unsuccessful in his bid to become President of the International Paralympic Committee.
