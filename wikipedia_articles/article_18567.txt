A penumbral lunar eclipse will occur at the Moon’s ascending node of orbit on Monday, April 3, 2034, with an umbral magnitude of −0.2263. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow, causing the Moon to be darkened. A penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when part or all of the Moon's near side passes into the Earth's penumbra. Unlike a solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth. Occurring about 2.2 days before apogee (on April 5, 2034, at 23:45 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter will be smaller.


== Visibility ==
The eclipse will be completely visible over east Africa, eastern Europe, Asia, and western Australia, seen rising over west Africa, western Europe, and eastern South America and setting over eastern Australia and northeast Asia.


== Eclipse details ==
Shown below is a table displaying details about this particular solar eclipse. It describes various parameters pertaining to this eclipse.


== Eclipse season ==

This eclipse is part of an eclipse season, a period, roughly every six months, when eclipses occur. Only two (or occasionally three) eclipse seasons occur each year, and each season lasts about 35 days and repeats just short of six months (173 days) later; thus two full eclipse seasons always occur each year. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. In the sequence below, each eclipse is separated by a fortnight.
