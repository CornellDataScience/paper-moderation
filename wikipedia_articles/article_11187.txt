Comrock is the name of a record label created in Mexico in the 1980s that was dedicated to promoting rock bands. It was coordinated by Ricardo Ochoa, guitar player of Kenny y los Eléctricos, and brought a wide audience to many Mexican bands. Five finalist bands were selected to obtain a recording contract for an LP. Two songs from each of these finalist bands were included on the compilation disk.
The name of the label came from a fusion of the words "compañía" (company) and "rock", and meant "the rock company".
The groups were:

Ritmo Peligroso
Kenny y los Eléctricos
Mask
Los Clips
Punto y Aparte
Luzbel
El Tri
