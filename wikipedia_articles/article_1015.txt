The Corrimal Cougars are an Australian rugby league football team based in Corrimal, a northern suburb of the city of Wollongong. The club are a part of Country Rugby League and has competed in the Illawarra Rugby League premiership since 1912.


== History, Colours and Emblem ==
The Corrimal Cougars were established in 1912 with the help from local miners. Traditionally the club has a working class history that has overcome many obstacles to provide an opportunity for local children and adults to enjoy Rugby League.
The Corrimal team is represented by a Cougar, and their emblem displays this creature in front of a red background in the shape of football. The name "Cougars" was chosen following a competition involving local school children.  Robyn Fletcher of East Corrimal Public School was the winner.  Underneath the name is the inscription "Est. 1912". Their colours are Green and Red. 
The Cougars play out of Ziems Park, Corrimal.


== Ziems Park ==
Ziems park was officially opened as the home ground of the Corrimal Cougars Rugby League Club on Saturday 14 April 1934. With Corrimal defeating Thirroul 5–0 for the Grant Gup, the Grant Cup was donated by Corrimal Hotel publican John Grant for the occasion.
The Ziems family originally owned the land and used it as an abattoir for their local butcher shop but in the early 1930 Arthur Ziems, spoke to members of his family about donating the land to the rugby league club. The family agreed on condition that the club fence off the land to be used for rugby league.
In 1970 the ground underwent major improvements including the banks around the main oval with the help of the South Bulli Mine's community relation project to become regarded as one of the best grounds in the Illawarra district.


== Premierships ==
The Corrimal Cougars have won two First Grade Premierships (1948, 1974)
