== History ==
Under the establishment of the National School Establishment Law, the university was formed in 1949 by the merger of the Tokyo Fine Arts School (東京美術学校, Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō) and the Tokyo Music School  (東京音楽学校, Tōkyō Ongaku Gakkō), both founded in 1887. The former Tokyo Fine Arts School was then restructured as the Faculty of Fine Arts under the university.
Originally male-only, the school began to admit women in 1946. The graduate school opened in 1963, and began offering doctoral degrees in 1977. The doctoral degree in fine art practice initiated in the 1980s was one of the earliest programs to do so globally. After the abolition of the National School Establishment Law and the formation of the National University Corporations on April 1, 2004, the school became known as the Kokuritsu Daigaku Hōjin Tōkyō Geijutsu Daigaku (国立大学法人東京藝術大学). On April 1, 2008, the university changed its English name from "Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music" to "Tokyo University of the Arts".
The school has had student exchanges with some of the nation's most highly regarded art and music institutions the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and the University of applied Arts, Vienna (Austria), the École des Beaux-Arts (France), School of the Art Institute of Chicago (USA), the Royal Academy of Music (UK), the University of Sydney and Queensland College of Art, Griffith University (Australia), the Korea National University of Arts, and the China Central Academy of Fine Arts.
