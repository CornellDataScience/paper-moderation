Joe Manganiello was originally cast as Rip Taggart but left the series in April 2016 "due to a 'manageable' preexisting health issue". About a week after Manganiello's departure, Walton Goggins was cast as his replacement. All of the already done shoots with Manganiello's character, nearly two full episodes, had to be re-shot. Also Christopher Backus had been cast, but left the project to be on the series Roadies before the series started shooting.
Season two, which consists of 10 episodes, was produced by a new production company, Six 2 North Productions Inc. Kimberly Peirce and Colin Bucksey are directors, with George Perkins the executive producer. Season two began filming on July 17, 2017, in Metro Vancouver, around Pemberton, and throughout British Columbia, and completed filming on November 23, 2017.
