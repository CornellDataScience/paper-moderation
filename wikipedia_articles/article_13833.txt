== Critical reception ==

Future received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 15 reviews. Riley Wallace of Exclaim! wrote, "With exciting production that features his usual cast of ATL tastemakers who are (in some cases) paired with surprising co-producers like Jake One and !llmind, Future has crafted an opus full of bangers. So, while he doesn't break much new creative ground, there's a lot to love about Future." Jordan Sargent of Spin dubbed it "a clear return to form". Colin Groundwater for Pretty Much Amazing stated that "Future is too persistent. In striving for consistency, he sacrifices discretion and intention. One wishes he would take a break—God knows he's earned it. Some time might allow for a stronger sense of intention."
Writing for The Observer, Alex Macpherson concluded, "...[and] as a body of work, this album is neither an elevation over nor an advancement of his stream of recent material. At this point, merely shoring up his personal brand with scattered highlights means that Future is stuck in a holding pattern." Chase McMullen, an author for The 405, said, "In a genre that's hard on longevity, and an era with an even shorter attention span, Future has refused to lose, time and again. He certainly doesn't end here. Yet, after a year of baited breathing, we seem to have arrived at an in-between. There's still plenty of fun to be had in the waiting room, but let's hope he has more in store for the next appointment." Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork, noted the album for being "...an ambitious Future exhibition" with "a pretty interesting array of textures, sonically."
