== History ==

By 1911, what is now PA 513 was a paved road between present-day US 13 and PA 132 while the remainder was unpaved. PA 513 was designated in 1928 to run from US 13 in Cornwells Heights north to PA 101 (Durham Road) near South Langhorne, following its present alignment to Hulmeville and continuing northeast on Trenton Road to PA 101. By this time, the entire route was paved. By 1947, PA 513 was realigned at Hulmeville to head north to US 1 (now US 1 Bus.) and PA 413 in Penndel, replacing a portion of PA 113.
