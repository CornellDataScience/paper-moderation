The Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro (Serbian: Ратно Ваздухопловство Србије и Црне Горе, РВСиЦГ, romanized: Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo Srbije i Crne Gore, lit. 'War Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro', RVSiCG), also known as the Air Force of Yugoslavia (JRV; Serbian: Југословенско Ратно Ваздухопловство, romanized: Jugoslovensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo, lit. 'Yugoslav War Air Force') from 1992 to 2003, was the air force of the former Serbia and Montenegro. It had around 300 fighter aircraft, ground attack aircraft, and other aircraft. The air force, in 1998, had about 16,000 personnel. The air force was disbanded when Montenegro voted to secede from the ex-FRY in 2006. The bulk of it was inherited by the Serbian Air Force and Air Defence.

=== Operation Allied Force ===
Around 50 Yugoslav aircraft were lost during the Kosovo War when NATO aircraft attacked FRY forces in 1999. Six MiG-29s were destroyed in dogfights against F-15s, F-16s, and F-18s. Other MiG-29s were destroyed on the ground when NATO forces attacked the FRY's Batajnica Airfield.


==== Casualties ====
The commander-in-chief of the Air Force said that Air Force and Air Defense had 40 killed and 110 wounded personnel in combat.
Air Force and Air Defense used innovative tactics to counter technologically more advanced and numerically superior opponents.
AF & AD C-in-C Lieutenant General Spasoje Smiljanić was promoted to the rank of Colonel General and awarded Medal of War Flag - First Degree.
Deputy of C-in-C Supreme Command Headquarters for the AF Colonel General Ljubiša Veličković was awarded the Medal of War Flag - First Degree. General Veličković was killed in combat.


===== Air combat =====

The first Yugoslav planes in the air were the Knights of the 127th LAE (127th Fighter Squadron) with their MiG-29s (they were the only unit operating them). Based on publicly released data one could conclude that three MiGs were scrambled from Batajnica Air Base with Lieutenant Colonel Ljubiša Kulačin, Major Nebojša Nikolić and Major Milorad Milutinović in the cockpits and two (Lieutenant Colonel Dragan Ilić, Major Iljo Arizanov) from Niš Airport. Since Germany had the same type of MiG-29 for a decade, NATO was expected to be successful in jamming radar and communication with GC center. Bearing that in mind and the fact that great numbers of enemy aircraft were in the air backed by four AWACS planes, Yugoslav pilots applied new tactics. They abandoned the usual leader-wingman formations and used fast solo dashes near ground to stay out of sight and then, when close enough to fire their R-73s (AA-11 Archer air-to-air missiles), engage in a vertical climb trying to get a firing solution with their KOLS laser - IR rangefinder/homing system.
The following pilots were awarded Bravery Medals and promoted to higher ranks:

Major Nebojsa Nikolić
Major Slobodan Perić (killed in car accident 30 May 2010)
Major Predrag Milutinović
Major Iljo Arizanov
Captain, 1st class Zoran Radosavljević, killed in combat
Other pilots that flew combat missions (based on data gathered so far):

Colonel General Ljubiša Veličković
Colonel Milenko Pavlovic, commander of 204. Fighter Aviation Regiment, killed in combat
Lieutenant Colonel Ljubiša Kulačin
Lieutenant Colonel Dragan Ilić
Major Abdul Emeti
Major Bora Zoraja
Major Dragan Milenković
