Jack Welpott (April 27, 1923 – November 24, 2007) was an American photographer.


== Biography ==
He was born in Kansas City on April 27, 1923, grew up in southern Indiana, and was educated at primary and secondary schools in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. He served in World War II, and returned to the Hoosier state to attend Indiana University. In 1949, he earned his BS in Economics from the Indiana University, Bloomington. Unsure of his direction, he enrolled in a photography class and met the legendary photography instructor Henry Holmes Smith. Under his tutelage, Welpott became enthralled with black-and-white photography as a fine art form.
He studied painting under Leon Golub and Harry Engle, and design with George Rickey, receiving   his MS in Visual Communication in 1955, followed by an  MFA in 1959.


== Career ==
He  began his long teaching career at San Francisco State College as he pursued the career of a professional photographer. In 1973 he was the recipient of the Medal of Arles, France; later that same year he received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts; and, in 1983, a Polaroid grant in association with the Museum of Photographic Arts, San Diego.
