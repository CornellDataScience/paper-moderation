Amid an otherwise undistinguished decade, the Missouri Tigers baseball team won the Big 12 Conference tournament in 2012. The team moved from the Big 12 Conference to the Eastern division of the Southeastern Conference in 2013. The Tigers struggled the first two seasons after the change of Conference, then improved to a limited extent. As of 2018 their best performance during the decade in a Conference league was in 2015 (won 15 out of 30, 50.0%) and their best overall performance was in 2018 (won 25 out of 37, 67.6%). Tim Jamieson retired as head coach in 2016 after 22 years, to be replaced by Steve Bieser.
