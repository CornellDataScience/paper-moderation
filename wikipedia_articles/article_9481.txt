Idol 2009 was the sixth season of the Swedish idol series and was broadcast by TV 4. The jury, identical to the previous year, consisted of Anders Bagge, Laila Bagge and Andreas Carlsson. Peter Jihde, the show's host, was also a continuation of the previous year's cast. The audition cities visited during the spring of 2009 were Gothenburg, Gävle, Malmö, Stockholm and Umeå, respectively. Around 11,000 people applied for Idol 2009, establishing a new Swedish record.
During auditions in Stockholm on 25 April, Idol 2008 winner Kevin Borg performed for the candidates, as well as Johan Palm who finished fourth in Idol 2008. In Gothenburg, Erik Segerstedt from Idol 2006 performed; and in Malmö, Sibel from Idol 2005. In Gävle, Idol 2008 runner-up Alice Svensson sang to the applicants; and in Umeå, Daniel Lindström from Idol 2004.
After the final of Idol 2008, the Idol producers said in a video on TV4's website that "Idol 2009 will be bigger than ever!" at the same time confirming that Idol would come back again during 2009. On 18 March TV4 published times and places for the year's audition tour. The programme started broadcasting on 8 September 2009.
After each show a program called "Idol: Eftersnack" was to be sent on TV400. As with the previous year, Katrin Zytomierska and Peter Jihde were the hosts.
On 15 October 2009, it was announced that the participant Erika Selin sang the demo for the song "Run", which would participate in Sweden's national selection "Melodifestivalen 2010" for Eurovision Song Contest 2010. A possible involvement in the festival, however, did not interfere with her participation in Idol.
In 2010, Clara was recruited to a newly started project with Jonas Berggren and Ulf Ekberg from Ace of Base. Clara was to share lead vocals with Julia Williamson. The first single from their album was released in September 2010.


== Changes/news ==
Quarterfinals and semifinals of Idol 2009 were to be broadcast from Malmö and Gothenburg, while the grand finale was to be aired from Ericsson Globe in Stockholm.
Anders Bagge was out on his own audition tour to find ten new talents, who didn't apply "the usual way" for Idol.
The vignette that appeared in the beginning and end of each Idol episode and also before and after each advertising break was updated. Between 2005 and 2008, it was a rapper who told who sponsored the program.
The two participants in the weekly finals which received the fewest votes were made to sing their songs again. Their previous votes were removed and a new round of voting decided who would leave.
