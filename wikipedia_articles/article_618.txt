The site now occupied by the city had a history of native Indian attacks. One of them took place on June 14, 1870. The Indians entered by the source of the  Quequén Salado (the river from which originates the Indio Rico creek) surprising the military forces. Many occupants were killed and their homes burned down. The development of a general industrial factory by John P. Alchurrut at the end of the 19th century was one of the first attempts populate the site. On December 7, 1929 the LDS Railways opened Indio Rico station for cargo, passengers and livestock.
