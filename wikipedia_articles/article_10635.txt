Smith is a Christian. Smith has said, “[Faith is] the foundation of everything I do, and I am so thankful for the way I was raised because I lean on the things I learned as a kid today as a grown man. ... I am a man of faith, and I am a man of God and I truly believe that everything is ordained for a purpose.”
