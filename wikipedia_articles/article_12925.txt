We vs. Death was a Dutch instrumental post-rock band, founded in 2000.


== History ==
 
In the second half of 2000 a couple of like-minded musicians find each other at Utrecht University in Netherlands and decide to start a band. The band's name was initially Dylman's Disco Method, but after a while was changed to We vs. Death. Almost right away they chose to make instrumental post-rock.
We vs. Death played large venues such as Paradiso, 013, Vera and Tivoli as well as small-scale venues and squats like the ACU and the OCCII. Outside The Netherlands, they played venues in Belgium, England, Canada, France, Russia, Poland, Denmark, Germany and Japan.

In 2003 the band released a split-CD with the Belgian post-rock band Tom Sweetlove. Each band contributed four songs for this release, titled "The Message Is", that was released on the Dutch Zabel Muziek-label and the Belgian Matamore-label.
