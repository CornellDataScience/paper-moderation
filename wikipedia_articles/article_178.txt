== Economy ==
The Missouri Meerschaum company, founded in 1869 is the first and oldest manufacturer of corn-cob pipes. With the introduction of the railroad in the late 1800s, Union saw an increase in population which in turn, increased the need for job opportunities. In 1907, The National Cob Pipe Works was opened to help fulfill the need for jobs in the area. In less than 10 years, it became one of the largest corn cob pipe manufacturers in the world, producing at least five million cob pipes a year. By 1925, there were almost a dozen corn cob pipes spread across Franklin County. The only surviving corn cob pipe factory left is the original Missouri Meerschaum Company located in Washington, Missouri.
Presently, there are over 300 businesses in Union, including the presence of manufacturers such as the Esselte Pendaflex Corporation and Silgan Plastic Containers.
