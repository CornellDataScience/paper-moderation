== Rules and regulations ==
The tournament is divided into a group stage and a knockout stage. In the group stage, teams face each other in a double round-robin tournament (i.e. each team plays every other team twice, once at home and once away). At the end of the group stage, the top team qualifies for the final. The teams in second and third take part in a play-off match with the winners contesting the final. If a match in the knockout stage ends with a tie, a Super Over will determine the winner.
Points were awarded as follows in the group stage:

The team that achieves a run rate of 1.25 times that of the opposition shall be rewarded one bonus point.
A team's run rate will be calculated by reference to the runs scored in an innings divided by the number of overs faced.
Points are deducted for slow over rate at 1 point per over not completed within the allotted 90 minutes.
In the event of teams finishing on equal points, the right to play in the semi-finals will be determined in the following order of priority:

The team with the most wins;
If still equal, the team with the most wins over the other team(s) who are equal on points and have the same number of wins;
If still equal, the team with the highest number of bonus points;
If still equal, the team with the highest net run rate;
The team with the higher runs to wickets ratio throughout the series.
