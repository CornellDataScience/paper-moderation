Charles Leslie Barrett (26 June 1879 – 16 January 1959) was an Australian naturalist, journalist, author and ornithologist.
Born in Hawthorn, Victoria, he was a foundation member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1901 and editor of its journal the Emu, 1910–1916. He also wrote for Walkabout. In 1953 he was awarded the Australian Natural History Medallion.
Charles Barrett also served in the AIF during the Great War.  He embarked from Melbourne in May 1917 as a member of a contingent of reinforcements for the Camel Field Ambulance Unit, and served in Egypt and Palestine.  His 1942 book, "On the Wallaby. Quest and adventure in many lands" contains an account and photographs of this mission.
His son Don moved to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, where he served as a member of the Legislative Council and House of Assembly.
