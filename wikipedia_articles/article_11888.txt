== History ==


=== Membership history ===

Historically, the percentage of Utahns who are Latter-day Saints was constantly increasing and went from six-tenths in 1920 to three-fourths in 1990, however, since then the proportion has decreased even though the number of church members has grown nominally. Much of this is due to the rise of secularism in the state, despite rapid population growth. In 2008, the US Census Bureau determined Utah to be the fastest growing state in the country in terms of population growth.
