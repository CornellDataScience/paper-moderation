== History ==
The Alhambra School District, which operated K-8 schools, and Alhambra Union High School District unified in 2004 to create the Alhambra Unified School District.


== Board of education ==
Alhambra Unified School District Board of Education members are represented by a geographical district composed of five members. The elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of even-numbered years at the same time the Alhambra City Council holds its elections.


== School Uniform ==
Students in grades Kindergarten through 8 are required to wear school uniforms [1].
The policy, which applied to the Alhambra School District, began in September 1996. The policy remained after the consolidation of ASD and AHSD, with the policy applying to all Kindergarten through 8th-grade students.
About every one to three years, the school board gives out surveys for the parents to fill out, asking for the opinion of whether or not the students should wear uniform. The school district asks for the students to wear uniform, but has made the exception of letting students include any color jacket or socks. Uniform colors include navy blue and white.
Students from some Elementary Schools may also apply for clothing permits to be dismissed from wearing school uniforms. The only exception for clothing while on a permit are garments that are explicit or have inappropriate content.
