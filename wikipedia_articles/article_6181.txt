As of 2024, 214,158 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 2000 from the Seongnam Bundang constituency.


== History ==
Since its creation in 2000, Seongnam Bundang A has been considered a conservative stronghold as it has consistently voted for conservative party candidates except for in the 2016 South Korean legislative election. 
Ko Heung-gil of the conservative Grand National Party was the first member to represent the constituency in the National Assembly. He won re-election in 2004 and 2008, but stood down in 2012 to serve as the Minister for Special Affairs under President Lee Myung-bak. He was succeeded by Lee Jong-hoon of the conservative Saenuri Party. Lee, a member of the pro-Yoo Seong-min faction of the Saenuri Party, was not nominated as the party's candidate for Seongnam Bundang A in  2016, Kwon Hyouk-se, a pro-Park Geun-hye candidate was nominated instead. Kwon lost to the liberal Democratic Party's Kim Byoung-gwan, marking the first time a candidate from a liberal party won in Seongnam Bundang A. However, Kim barely lost his bid for re-election in 2020 to Kim Eun-hye of the conservative United Future Party, with only 1,128 votes separating the two candidates. Kim Eun-hye resigned as the constituency's member of the National Assembly on April 28, 2022 to run as the People Power Party candidate for Governor of Gyeonggi Province in the 2022 South Korean local elections. A by-election was held in June 2022 between Kim Byoung-gwan of the Democratic Party and two-time presidential candidate Ahn Cheol-soo of the People Power Party. Ahn won the election in a landslide, securing 62.5% of the vote.
