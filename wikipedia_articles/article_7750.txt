Christine Klein is a German physician who is a professor of neurology and neurogenetics at the University of Lübeck. Her research considers the molecular genetics of movement disorders. She is a Fellow of the European Academy of Neurology, former President of the German Neurological Society and incoming President of the European Section of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.


== Early life and education ==
Klein studied medicine at the University of Hamburg. She completed internships in Stockholm, Wollongong and Vitebsk. In 1997, she moved to Boston, where she was a fellow in neurogenetics with Xandra O. Breakefield. She completed her final year studies at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology. She finished her training in neurology at the University of Lübeck, and spent several summers working with Anthony E. Lang in Toronto.


== Research and career ==
In 2005, Klein was made the Lichtenberg Professor in the University of Lübeck Department of Neurology. Her research considers the molecular genetics of movement disorders. She has extensively studied the genetics of Parkinson's disease, and has identified several genetic risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing Parkinson's. She was made Schilling Professor of Clinical and Molecular Neurogenetics in 2013, and appointed Director of the Institute of Neurogenetics.
In 2019, Klein became President of the German Neurological Society. She was the first women to chair the 10,000+ member society.


== Awards and honours ==
2014 BioMedTech Prize
2019 C. David Marsden Lecture Award
2019 Cotzias Award of the Spanish Society of Neurology
2021 Elected to the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina
