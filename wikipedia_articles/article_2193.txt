Montserrat Teixidor i Bigas (born February 25, 1958) is a Spanish-American academic who is a professor of mathematics at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. She specializes in algebraic geometry, especially Moduli of Vector Bundles on curves.


== Education ==
Teixidor i Bigas was born in Barcelona in 1958. She earned a bachelor's degree and PhD from the University of Barcelona, where she wrote her dissertation, "Geometry of linear systems on algebraic curves", under the supervision of Gerard Eryk Welters.


== Career ==
She worked in the department of pure mathematics at the University of Liverpool, where she wrote "The divisor of curves with a vanishing theta-null", for Compositio Mathematica in 1988.
In 1997, she proved Lange's conjecture for the generic curve, with Barbara Russo, which states that "If

She took up an appointment as an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Tufts University, and has been on the faculty of Tufts since 1989. She has been a reviewer for several journals, including the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, the Duke Mathematical Journal, and the journal of algebraic geometry. She has held visiting positions at Brown University and the University of Cambridge. She was also a co-organizer of the Clay Institute's workgroup on Vector Bundles on Curves.
In 2004, she spent a year at Radcliffe College as a Vera M. Schuyler Fellow, devoting her time to study of "the interplay between the geometry of curves and the equations defining them."
