Emile Boeswillwald born in Strasbourg on 2 February 1815.

In 1864 land was purchased beside the Villa Eugénie in Biarritz on which to erect a chapel designed by Boeswillwald.
The chapel, dedicated to Our Lady of Guadeloupe, was consecrated in September 1865. It incorporated an eclectic mix of Roman and Byzantine art with Hispano-Moorish elements from Seville and Granada. It was painted by Alexandre-Dominique Denuelle and Louis Steinheil.
Boeswillwald produced a series of watercolor drawings of the soldiers of the First Empire in the years 1890–1891.
The painter Léon Bonnat represented his friend in 1890.
Emile Boeswillwald died in Paris on 20 March 1896.
