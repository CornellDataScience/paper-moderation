Most of his over 300 scientific publications have focused on the health effects of income inequality and poverty, the quality of life of communities and individuals, and the impact of government decisions on Canadians' health and well-being. More recently, he has written on the need for a socialist future as capitalism is not only creating numerous health problems but seems incapable  of solving them. Over the course of his career he has published 16 books, 67 book chapters, and 160 refereed journal articles. Raphael has recently published on the affinities between the social determinants of health and the social determinants of oral health, health discourses among disease associations, and concepts of legitimacy and competency of governing authorities in liberal welfare states. He also has had articles published concerning health inequalities in the Republic of Rwanda and the Nordic nations. He previously published two articles on the health of Nordic nations in the Scandinavian Journal of Public Health.
