Antonio Morrison (born December 6, 1994) is an American former professional football linebacker. He played college football for Florida, and was selected by the Indianapolis Colts in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL draft.


== Early life ==
Morrison lived in Bellwood, Illinois, and Romeoville, Illinois, before settling in Bolingbrook, Illinois, where he attended Bolingbrook High School. He was a three-year varsity starter for the football team. As a senior linebacker in 2011, Morrison was named 1st Team All-State after leading Bolingbrook to an IHSA Class 8A State Championship. After the season, Morrison participated in the Semper Fidelis All-American Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona. He was named a USA Today 2nd Team All-American.

== College career ==
In July 2013, Morrison was charged with interfering with a police animal after barking at a police dog. The charge was dropped after it was determined that Morrison acted without malice. He was suspended for 2 games for the incident by Florida head coach Will Muschamp.
On January 3, 2015, Morrsion played in the 2015 Birmingham Bowl, but left the Gators 28–20 victory over East Carolina in the second quarter after he suffered a knee injury while making a tackle. While covering a screen pass to an East Carolina running back, Morrison and a teammate playing defensive lineman both converged the East Carolina player to make the tackle. Morrison's teammate accidentally collided with his planted left leg. He immediately crumbled to the ground, clutching his left leg and began screaming in pain uncontrollably. The following day, Morrison was diagnosed with torn ligaments and a torn ACL in his left knee. His injury was described as devastating and Morrison was told he may never normally walk again, let alone return to football. The injury, dramatically changed Morrison's initial plan to forgo his senior season and enter the 2015 NFL draft. He had two surgeries on January 9, 2014 and February 23, 2015. Morrison was given a ten-month timetable to fully recovery, but managed to return in six months and was given the permission to return to football the following month in August.
In four seasons with the Florida Gators, Morrison compiled 315 total tackles, 21 tackles-for-loss, 4.5 sacks, 1 interception, and 3 forced fumbles.
