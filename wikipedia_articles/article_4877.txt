It was built from 1953 to 1955 after a design by Erich Boltenstern at the Schottenring. The tower is 73 m (240 ft) tall, with 12,000 m2 (130,000 sq ft) of office space, and is the second highest building within the Vienna Ringstraße, after the Stephansdom. It is a venue for architecture exhibitions, and is known for being turned into a piece of art annually, wrapped in cloth designed by notable artists including Robert Hammerstiel, Xenia Hausner, Arnulf Rainer and Mihael Milunović.


== History ==
The Ringturm tower was built from 1953 to 1955 after a design by Erich Boltenstern at the Schottenring, part of the Vienna Ringstraße. The tower of 73 m (240 ft) was an innovative project when Vienna was reconstructed after World War II. The building was erected on a property that held the only building of the Schottenring demolished in the war. At 23 floors, it is the second highest building within the Vienna Ringstraße, after the Stephansdom. The building has 12,000 m2 (130,000 sq ft) of office space, and is the headquarters of the Vienna Insurance Group. It also houses offices of the Wiener Stadtwerke. The facade and some other parts were reconstructed in 1996.


=== Name ===
The name was found by a competition. It was chosen from 6,502 suggestions, including City-Haus, Gutwill-Haus, Haus der Gegenseitigkeit, Hoch-Eck, Neues Hochhaus and Sonnblick-Haus.


=== Weather beacon ===
On top of the tower is a weather beacon (Wetterleuchtturm) 20 m (66 ft) in height. Its 117 lamps (39 white, red and green) indicate weather predictions for the following day by partly blinking and moving combinations. It is connected to the ZAMG (Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik), the centre for weather forecast on the Hohe Warte. The top has two aircraft warning lights.

Beacon indicators
red lights increasing in luminosity = rising temperature
red lights decreasing in luminosity = falling temperature
green lights increasing in luminosity = improving weather
green lights decreasing in luminosity = worsening weather
green lights with uniform luminosity = steady weather
red lights blinking = storm warning
white lights blinking = snow or black ice


=== Exhibition and events ===
Beginning in 1998, architectural exhibitions have been displayed in the entrance hall free of charge. A series Architektur im Ringturm is focused on architecture of Austria, Central Europe and Eastern Europe. Regular television series of the ORF have been produced in the building, including Lebenskünstler with Helmut Zilk and Kabarett im Turm.
