This is the list of the episodes for the American cooking television series and competition Iron Chef America, produced by Food Network. The series is based on the Japanese series Iron Chef and is a cooking competition in which a challenger chef "battles" one of the resident "Iron Chefs" by cooking five or more dishes in a one-hour time slot based around a secret ingredient or ingredients, and sometimes theme. In most episodes, three judges score the meal in three categories, with 10 points available to each judge for taste, 5 points for creativity, and 5 points for presentation, for a possible total of 60 points. Exceptions are noted for individual episodes.


== Episodes ==


=== Battle of the Masters: 2004 ===
Iron Chef America was first aired as a mini-series entitled Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters. For Battle of the Masters, two of the original Iron Chefs competed along with three Food Network personalities in various match ups with one another.


=== Season 1: 2005 ===


=== Season 2: 2005 ===


=== Season 3: 2006–2007 ===


=== Season 4: 2007 ===


=== Season 5: 2007 ===


=== Season 6: 2008 ===


=== Season 7: 2008–2009 ===


=== Season 8: 2010 ===


=== Season 9: 2010–2011 ===
A modification to the judging was made this season.  At the end of each chef's presentation, the Chairman asked each judge to sum up their impressions of the chef's dishes, although not every episode includes this segment.


=== Season 10: 2011–2012 ===


=== Season 11: 2012–2013 ===
Starting in Season 11, the first dish is due to the judges 20 minutes after the start of the battle. Additionally, a culinary curveball—an ingredient, piece of equipment, or plating device—is announced by the chairman part way through the battle. Each chef is required to integrate the item into at least one of their remaining dishes, and receives scoring from the judges based on the item's use. Up to 30 points are awarded for taste, 15 for plating, 15 for creativity, 15 for the first dish, and 15 for use of the culinary curveball, for a possible total of 90 points.


==== Iron Chef America Tournament of Champions ====
In this first ever Iron Chef vs. Iron Chef tournament, the four newest Chefs compete to take on either Iron Chef Symon or Iron Chef Morimoto, with the winners of those battles going head-to-head.  Bobby Flay served as head judge in the finale.


==== Season 11, continued ====


=== Season 12: 2013–2014 ===


=== Iron Chef Showdown ===

Iron Chef returned to Food Network on November 8, 2017 as a ten episode series called Iron Chef Showdown. Iron Chefs Bobby Flay, Jose Garces, Alex Guarnaschelli, and Michael Symon return for this series; they are joined by the newest Iron Chef, Iron Chef Gauntlet winner Stephanie Izard. Iron Chef Showdown featured several rules differences from Iron Chef America and is therefore considered a series of its own rather than the thirteenth season of Iron Chef America. Iron Chef America would return to the air six months later, in May 2018.


=== Season 13: 2018 ===
Food Network announced that Iron Chef America would return in its original format, with new episodes beginning May 20, 2018. Two format changes implemented in Iron Chef Showdown were retained: the number of judges has been reduced to two, and there is no Culinary Curveball. 
Each judge can award up to 25 points: 10 for flavor, 5 for plating, 5 for creativity, and 5 for the first dish, for a total of 50 points. Alongside the judges, the Chairman sits at judge's table during judging. This season Jet Tila serves as the floor reporter, succeeding Kevin Brauch and Jaymee Sire.


== Win–loss records ==
The winning percentage for Iron Chefs participating on Iron Chef America is an average. The win/loss data is based solely on the performance of the participant as an Iron Chef in Iron Chef America: The Series and the Battle of the Masters but does not include the results from Iron Chef Showdown.
