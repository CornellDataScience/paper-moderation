Langside railway station is a railway station that serves the Langside and Newlands area of Glasgow, Scotland. It is located on the Cathcart Circle Line. Services are provided by ScotRail on behalf of Strathclyde Partnership for Transport.


== History ==

The station was opened as part of the western extension of the Cathcart District Railway on 2 April 1894. It consists of a single island platform accessed by a subway and stairs to Langside Drive at the west end, and to Earls Park Avenue (north exit) and Tannahill Road (south exit) at the east end, with a self-service ticket machine added in spring 2007. The Cathcart Circle Line has been electrified since 1962 by British Railways.

=== 1974 to 1979 ===
Between the electrification of the WCML and the opening of the Argyle Line, trains ran Mondays to Saturdays, with two Cathcart Circle trains per hour in each direction and two Glasgow Central to Kirkhill trains per hour in each direction. Occasional peak hour trains were extended through to Motherwell via the Hamilton Circle lines.


=== 1979 to early 1990s ===
Following the opening of the Argyle line, Kirkhill services were extended through to Newton.


=== Early 1990s to present day (2016) ===
The service pattern has been revised to include Sunday trains.
The service consists of one train between Glasgow Central and Newton in each direction every hour, seven days a week and one Cathcart Circle train in each direction on Mondays to Saturdays.
There is a higher frequency of trains in the weekday morning and evening rush hour periods.
