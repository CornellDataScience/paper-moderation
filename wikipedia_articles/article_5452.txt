The Guatemala national Under-20 football team is the national under-20 age level football team of Guatemala, and represents the nation in under-20 international matches.
The team has qualified to the FIFA U-20 World Cup twice, in 2011 and 2023. It finished in the top 4 of the CONCACAF region at the 2011 CONCACAF U-20 Championship, earning the first participation in a World Cup finals tournament at any level for Guatemala.


== History ==
At the 2011 CONCACAF U-20 Championship held in Guatemala City in March and April 2011, Guatemala advanced to the second round as second of a 3-team series which included Honduras and Jamaica. Guatemala then played a direct elimination quarterfinal match against the United States, and won 2-1 which secured a place in the top four and thus participation in the 2011 U-20 World Cup. The result was considered a significant upset by the international news media as the United States was one of the strongest teams in CONCACAF.

Guatemala was drawn into Group D of the tournament along Nigeria, Croatia, and Saudi Arabia. Their debut match was a 0-5 loss against Nigeria. Following a 6-0 loss to Saudi Arabia, Guatemala defeated Croatia 1-0 to advance to the Round of 16, where they were eliminated by losing 0-1 to Portugal.
