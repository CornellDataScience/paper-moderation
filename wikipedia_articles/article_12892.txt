Alderwood Manor was a community that is now the cities of Lynnwood, Brier, and Mountlake Terrace. Alderwood Manor was a farming community where most residents raised chickens. Alderwood Manor was connected to Everett and Seattle by the interurban trolley system. Most signs of Alderwood have since disappeared but in 2004 Lynnwood's Heritage Park opened. The Heritage Park has some old buildings of the Lynnwood area, such as The Wickers Building, which served as Alderwood's main store and post office from 1919 to the 1960s. Other buildings included Car 55 of the interurban.
In 1979 Lynnwood's largest tourist attraction, the Alderwood Mall was built.
The only Alderwood Manor building still in the same place as when it was built is the old Masonic Temple. The Manor Hardware building (originally used as a schoolhouse in the early 1900s, but which had been vacant for many years) was demolished in 2015. Both locations are just off of 196th St SW in Lynnwood. Some private homes still stand in the area as well.
