== Plot ==

Nandini, a college student, is the sole niece of four brothers—Ramankutty, Achuthankutty, Shankarankutty, and Keshavankutty—who maintain a close familial bond. Nandini, without immediate family, resides in a women's hostel near her college. Despite occasional advances from peers, the four brothers, playfully nicknamed the "Hitler brothers" by youngsters, act as vigilant guardians.
Concerned for Nandini's well-being, the brothers decide to arrange her marriage to a prosperous individual. Gopan, a wealthy doctor, is chosen as the prospective groom, and Nandini agrees to the arrangement. However, despite Gopan's family expressing no expectation of dowry, it becomes evident that Gopan's interest in the marriage is tied to Nandini's properties.
Nandini owns a property leased to the Kerala Police for use as a police station. The brothers seeking to allocate it as dowry for Nandini, harshly ask the police to vacate the premises. However, head constable Bhaktha Valsalan, misunderstanding their intentions, handles the situation physically, prompting the brothers to consult an advocate, Manmadhan, and opt for legal resolution.
A new sub-inspector, Sundaran, takes charge, who resides with his father and sister opposite Nandini's hostel. Nandini and her uncles serve a legal notice to Sundaran, requesting the vacation of the police station. Meanwhile, Manmadhan, the advocate, develops a romantic interest in Nandini, who casually redirects his love letter to Sundaran's sister, Sundari, fostering a reciprocal sentiment.
Gopan invites Nandini to a hotel room, attempting to coerce her into a physical relationship. Expressing her strong disapproval, Nandini firmly communicates her reluctance to proceed with the marriage. Sundaran and a police squad inadvertently arrive at the hotel, where Sundaran, witnessing the situation, intervenes, saving Nandini and expressing his disdain for Gopan.
