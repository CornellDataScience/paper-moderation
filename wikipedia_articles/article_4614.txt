This list of Mario television episodes covers three television series based upon Nintendo's Mario series of video games. The three series were produced by DIC Entertainment: The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! (1989) is based upon Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2; The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 (1990) is based upon Super Mario Bros. 3; and Super Mario World (1991) is loosely based upon Super Mario World. All three series focus on the characters of Mario and Luigi assisting Princess Toadstool and Toad in thwarting the plots and schemes of King Koopa. Super Show would also feature additional live-action storylines following the Mario Bros. at their plumbing business in Brooklyn, and once per week would replace the usual animated Mario segment with one based on The Legend of Zelda.
Each series episodes is listed in order of airdate. The names "Princess Toadstool" and "King Koopa" are primarily used prior to the release of Super Mario 64, which define them as "Princess Peach" and "Bowser" respectively. The Koopalings are defined with different names and personalities in The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 before the American names were decided by Nintendo, and retain these for Super Mario World. By 1991, all three Super Mario animated series had broadcast a combined total of 91 episodes.
