== Cycling ==
Xorret de Catí is one of the most famous cycling climbs in the Valencia region. It is often present at Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana. It instantly become a hit with fans since its first appearance in the 1998 Vuelta a España - a stage won by climber Chava Jiménez. The climb beginning just south of Castalla is undoubtedly the star side of Xorret de Catí, with consistently steep gradients - at times in excess of 20% - testing even the strongest of climbers.


=== Monument to the cyclist ===
At the top of the climb there is a "monument to the cyclist" (es: Monumento al Ciclista del Xorret del Catí). It is a bronze statue, on a marble plinth, representing of a racing cyclist climbing the hill. 
This iconic sculpture, was  created by the Spanish sculptor Vicente Ferrero in the year 2003 as a tribute to the cyclists who were ascending Xorret de Catí as a result of the uphill finishes of La Vuelta in this challenging setting. The sculpture's weights 300 kilograms, measuring 175x55x178cm. On the plinth there is the list of winners of Vuelta a España stages on this hill, as well as winners of Vuelta a la Comunitat Valenciana Feminas stages.
In May 2023 the sculpture was stolen - not a simple task, considering its weight and size.
