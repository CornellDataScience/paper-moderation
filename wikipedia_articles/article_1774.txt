== Etymology ==
iBhayi (sometimes eBhayi) is a Xhosa word meaning "the bay". Although iBhayi is the name used for the collection of predominantly black townships north of Port Elizabeth, it is also used as a name for the city amongst Xhosa-speaking people.


== Geography ==
iBhayi is a collection of predominantly black townships situated north of the city of Port Elizabeth, similar to how Soweto, south-west of Johannesburg is also a collection of predominantly black townships.
Most of iBhayi lies east of the R75 except for its northern extensions of KwaDwesi, New KwaDwesi and Masibulele which lie west of the R75.
iBhayi is surrounded by the predominantly Coloured township of Bethelsdorp and the neighbourhood of Algoa Park in the west, Redhouse and Perseverance in the north-east, Swartkops in the east and Deal Party in the south-east.
The main roads in iBhayi are the R75 to Uitenhage and Despatch in the north and Port Elizabeth in the south and the R367/M19 to Despatch in the north and Swartkops in the south.
New Brighton has been in existence since the region was still farmland and is one of the biggest and oldest settled townships in Ibhayi, while KwaMagxaki township, which was established in 1985, is the second-highest black income suburb. KwaMagxaki is home to a diversified group of professionals, businesspeople and civil servants.
