Born on 18 March 1950, Perkins was educated at Imperial College London, graduating with a first-class Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering in 1971; he was awarded the Hinchley Memorial Medal. He then spent two years studying for a PhD at Imperial, supported by a studentship from Salters' Institute of Industrial Chemistry, before becoming a demonstrator in chemical engineering at the University of Cambridge. In 1977, his PhD was awarded, and in the same year, he returned to Imperial as a lecturer. He was promoted to a senior lectureship in 1983 and then moved to the University of Sydney in 1985, where for three years he was ICI Professor of Systems Engineering.
