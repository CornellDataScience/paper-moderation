Richard Ernest Kronauer (1925 – October 18, 2019) was the Gordon McKay Professor of Mechanical Engineering, emeritus, at Harvard University.  Though experienced with research in both fluid mechanics and applied mathematics. 
He is primarily known for his pioneering work in mathematical biology, especially his research on human circadian rhythms.  Kronauer's 1982 paper "Mathematical model of the human circadian system with two interacting oscillators" outlined a new method for understanding the biological circuits that underlie daily body cycles in variables such as blood pressure or body temperature.  Professor Kronauer's research also has direct implications for the causes and possible cures for many types of sleep disorders, and for this he received the Farrell Prize in Sleep Medicine in June 2008.
