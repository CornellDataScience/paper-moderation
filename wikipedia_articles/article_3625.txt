Raffin made his debut in the Moto2 World Championship in 2012 with GP Team Switzerland as a replacement for the injured Randy Krummenacher; in three races he had an 18th place at Sepang as best finish.
After winning the CEV Moto2 Championship in 2014, in 2015 Raffin was back to the Moto2 World Championship as a full-time rider, competing with a Kalex for the Sports-Millions–Emwe–SAG team. He failed to score championship points, as his best result was 17th place, obtained in third occasions—Indianapolis, Motegi and Phillip Island. Raffin remained with the same team for 2016. He achieved his first Grand Prix points at Jerez with a 14th place and a best result of 8th at Sachsenring.
In 2017, Raffin switched to the Garage Plus Interwetten team from his home country Switzerland. He collected 26 points and finished 20th in the standings. Raffin did not find a ride for the 2018 season, but was recalled by his former SAG team as a replacement rider for six of the final seven races after Isaac Viñales parted ways with the team prematurely. In six races, Raffin achieved 10 points and 22nd in the standings. In the same year he won the FIM CEV Moto2 European Championship.
In 2019, Raffin joined the inaugural MotoE World Cup with the German Dynavolt Intact GP team. He collected 47 points and finished the season in 8th. Raffin also had eight replacement rider entries in the Moto2 season, one with the Intact GP team and seven with RW Racing GP. Having impressed in his replacement entries with RW, Raffin was signed by the team to make his full-time return to Moto2 for 2020.
