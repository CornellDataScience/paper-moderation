QuickChek is a chain of convenience stores based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey with 153 stores in New Jersey and New York. The first store opened in Dunellen, New Jersey in 1967, and has since then grown into a chain. Several stores include pharmacies, gas stations, and liquor departments.
The size of the stores range from smaller corner-type shops to larger convenience stores. Many stores are located in urban areas, and most are open 24 hours a day. Former stores with pharmacies tended to offer a pharmacy-like selection of health products and aids. Stores have PNC Bank ATMs inside.
Initially, QuickChek stores were mini-supermarkets with mostly grocery items, snack foods, delis, candy, milk, bread, soda, medicated products, some prepackaged meats, and a small produce area. During the 1990s the stores began to offer fuel as well and gradually changed focus on snack foods, drinks, ready to eat foods, and gas stations. Still, QuickChek stores typically offer moderate amounts of basic groceries such as bread, milk, and a few grocery items, frozen dinners, as well as soft drinks, bottled water, ready to eat sandwiches, and a wide selection of snack foods. They also serve coffee, frozen beverages (Quick Freeze), and sandwiches. Some stores also serve milkshakes and frozen cappuccinos. Like most convenience stores, QuickChek sells cigarettes and other tobacco products, along with lottery tickets. Most sell fuel as well, which has become the main draw to these stores.
QuickChek also has its own assortment of baked goods, some of which are baked fresh in-store.

== Branchburg QuickChek incident ==
On January 26, 2010, a clerk at the QuickChek at 1296 Easton Turnpike in Branchburg, New Jersey, called the police about a suspicious man in the store. The clerk said she knew the man "had something on him", but was uncertain what it was. Officers arrested Lloyd Woodson, and found in his possession and in his motel room a large weapons cache that included illegal weapons and ammunition, a detailed map of Fort Drum, and a red-and-white checked headdress that police said resembled a keffiyeh worn by men from parts of the Middle East. He was charged on multiple state and federal weapons charges.  Branchburg Police Chief Brian Fitzgerald later praised QuickChek clerk Linda Yannazzno and employee Michael Murray for their alertness.
