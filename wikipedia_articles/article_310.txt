The notable Alumni of the Royal Military College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst are numerous. In particular, there are so many generals and Victoria Cross holders from the former Royal Military College, Sandhurst, that a full list would be immense.
This list contains a number of students who did not complete the course. Some of the members of foreign royal families were not commissioned into the British Army.
Despite claims to the contrary, Idi Amin and Muammar Gaddafi did not attend Sandhurst.
The Sandhurst Foundation acts as a community for the alumni of the Royal Military Academy.
