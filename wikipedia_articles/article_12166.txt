The Chapare Drug Cartel is a Bolivian criminal organization dedicated to drug trafficking and human trafficking that operates in the Chapare region. For this, several journalists have baptized this organization simply as the Chapare Cartel
During the entire presidency of Evo Morales in Bolivia and the expulsion of the DEA  from this country in 2008, drug trafficking has skyrocketed in the country. Since 2014, Bolivia is one of the principal producers of cocaine in the world. According to the UN 94% of the coca production of the country goes to illegal markets. 
The cartel currently has strong connections with the political party of the Movement for Socialism. For all these reasons, the Interamerican Institute for Democracy described the government of Evo Morales as that of a Narco-state
. This vision is shared by researcher Diego Ayo from the Vicente Pazos Kanki foundation. Currently the structure of the cartel is unknown. However, according to the Peruvian journalist Jaime Bayly, the head of the cartel would be the former president of Bolivia, Evo Morales while the coca growers unions are the main drug suppliers for the international market.
