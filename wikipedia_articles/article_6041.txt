The film was shot in France, with lead actor Eashwar, who is a non-resident Indian, facilitating the shoot. Eashwar's father had been an actor in Tamil films and he was able to discuss the script with producers Gurumurthi and director R. N. Murugesan during their visit to Paris. After the completion of the shoot, Eashwar moved to Chennai to try and pursue a career in films, but was largely unsuccessful.


== Soundtrack ==

The film score and the soundtrack were composed by Deva. The soundtrack, released in 2001, features 6 tracks with lyrics written by Palani Bharathi, P. Vijay and Kalaikumar.


== Release and reception ==
A critic from Tamil Star wrote that "though the narrative style is very amateusrish and the screenplay has scenes that are cliched and situations that seemed to be forced into the narration". Malathi Rangarajan The Hindu wrote that "In these days of using foreign locations for song sequences alone, in Love Channel they are used as a beautiful backdrop to tell the story. But will someone tell our producers that foreigners dancing for our desi numbers present a pathetic picture?"
Following the release of the film, Eashwar signed on to produce and appear in a film directed by Bharathi Ganesh, who had earlier made Kannupada Poguthaiya (1999). Titled Velayudham, the film featured Eashwar alongside Mammootty and Pratyusha but was later stalled.
