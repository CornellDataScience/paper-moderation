The following is a list of local children's television shows in the United States. These were locally produced commercial television programs intended for the child audience with unique hosts and themes. This type of programming began in the late 1940s and continued into the late 1970s; some shows continued into the 1990s. Author Tim Hollis documented about 1,400 local children's shows in a 2002 book, Hi There, Boys and Girls!
The television programs typically aired in the weekday mornings before school or afternoons after school, as well as on weekends (to a lesser degree). There were different formats. Almost all shows had a colorful host who assumed a persona, such as a cowboy/cowgirl, captain/skipper/commodore/admiral, jungle explorer, astronaut, king, princess, clown, sheriff/deputy/trooper, cop, firefighter, hobo/tramp, railroad engineer, magician, "cousin", "grandfather" or "uncle", whose role was not only to be the "DJ" for syndicated material (typically cartoons, although Westerns were more popular earlier on) but also to entertain, often with a live television studio audience of kids, during breaks.
Early program fare included cartoon favorites, such as Koko the Clown, Daffy Duck, Crusader Rabbit, Dick Tracy, Popeye, Bugs Bunny, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Mighty Mouse, Porky Pig, Deputy Dawg, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, Mel-O-Toons, Woody Woodpecker, The Funny Company, Mr. Magoo, Space Angel and Clutch Cargo, as well as movie shorts, such as Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang/The Little Rascals and The Three Stooges, as well as animated versions of Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and The Three Stooges, and live action shorts, such as Diver Dan. Some included educational segments like the portraits of wildlife in Nature's Window.

KRCG-TV/KMOS-TV/KOMU-TV: Sesame Street (Due to the lack of a PBS station in Mid-Missouri, CBS stations KRCG and KMOS began premiering PBS's Sesame Street on January 4, 1971 as a weekday morning program [9:00-10:00 AM] after a spokesman for a local group replied that KRCG was confident enough for the Citizens of Sesame Street Fund could raise money that it had notified CBS of the preemption replacement of two programs. Both stations dropped Sesame Street during the first week of March 1977 due to the station's revenue losses, and the former Sesame Street slot was replaced with The New Price Is Right that originally aired in the afternoon hours. This led to major consequences on a new station for the program in the market. In April 1977, Columbia's ABC station KCBJ immediately seek funds for Sesame Street to return in Mid-Missouri planning on airing it on weekday evenings rather than weekday mornings, but failed days after announcement due to the Missouri Department of Education reported no funds in its budget available. Then NBC station KOMU came along to seek funds as well, as the staff at KOMU paid an additional $1,825 from its general operating budget to run the program. The staff at KOMU promised to only air the show briefly in its lineup due to concerns over the same reason why KRCG pulled Sesame Street off its lineup. KOMU immediately aired Sesame Street at the same slot as KRCG/KMOS as a replacement of both Sanford & Son and Hollywood Squares for a brief time from June 20, 1977 until August 31, 1977).
