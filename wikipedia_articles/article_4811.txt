== History ==


=== Formation and early releases (2001–2006) ===
Four Year Strong was formed in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 2001 by Dan O'Connor, Alan Day, Jake Massucco and a fourth musician who played bass guitar. They all attended Doherty Memorial High School. Soon, they released a demo EP titled All The Lonely Girls. In the subsequent years, they released two more EPs; The Glory EP (2003) and a three track demo in 2004. Around this time, Joe Weiss was brought in as a replacement bassist. In 2005 the band released their first studio album, It's Our Time, digitally on Open Your Eyes Records. They went on a West Coast and Midwest tour with Maida and the Fully Down in October and November 2005. They went on a tour with Showoff in March and April 2006.
The band released another demo in 2006, which contained early versions of their songs from Rise or Die Trying. Keyboardist Josh Lyford joined in late 2006 to make the band a five-piece.


=== Rise or Die Trying, Explains It All (2006–2009) ===
The band's 2007 release Rise or Die Trying with I Surrender Records peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart in its debut week. On the back of their increasing popularity, the band was signed to Decaydance Records in February 2008.
On July 21, 2009, Four Year Strong released a covers album, titled Explains It All. The album features guest appearances from Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die, Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, and JR and Buddy of Less Than Jake. The band explained their reasoning behind the album in a MySpace blog, saying "It's what we grew up listening to. Everyone has those songs that instantly transport you back to when you were younger. Whether we were in our bedrooms playing air guitar, or riding in the car to little league practice, or it was just that song that was all over the radio during that awesome summer at the Cape. These songs have impacted us in some way and we want to share that feeling with you."


=== Enemy of the World (2010–2011) ===
The band's third full-length album, Enemy of the World, was released on March 9, 2010, with Universal Motown Records. The band released the album's first single, "It Must Really Suck to Be Four Year Strong Right Now", on December 21, 2009. The name of the song is a reference to the final sentence of a review in Alternative Press in which the magazine praised Set Your Goals' new album while remarking on the future of Four Year Strong and how their record would compare. The vinyl record was made available to pre-order on March 2, 2010. The album sold 12,400 copies in its first week, debuting at number 47 on the Billboard 200. Four Year Strong has accompanied Set Your Goals in an Asian tour, but both canceled touring in Indonesia.


=== In Some Way, Shape, or Form and hiatus (2011–2013) ===
On April 3, 2011, it was announced that Josh Lyford would be leaving the band. Initially, it was implied that Lyford had chosen to leave in order to focus on his side project, Foxfires. However, it was later confirmed by both Lyford and Alan Day that Lyford had been ejected from the band, as the musicians had elected to remove synthesizers from their sound, leaving no room for Lyford to continue. On April 13, 2011, in an interview with Alternative Press, the band revealed that they had been in the middle of recording their fourth studio album with producer David Bendeth in New Jersey's House of Loud. The band was set to return to the studio, without Josh Lyford, to finish the album in June, after they finished touring with Rise Against. Vocalist Alan Day also revealed that the new songs the band had written were very diverse, and that the new material was different from anything the band had ever written before. While touring with Rise Against, they played a newly recorded, yet unreleased, song called "Falling on You".
On August 18, 2011, the band released "Stuck in the Middle", a new song from the upcoming album. The band announced that the new album, In Some Way, Shape, or Form, would be released on November 8, 2011. On September 8, 2011, the band released another song from the album, titled "Falling on You". The first official single from the album, "Just Drive", was released on September 27, 2011.
During the Fall 2011 AP Tour, the band played another new unreleased song to be released on the upcoming album. The band dedicated it to fans who have been there "from the very beginning, and will be there till the very end"; a video of the song has been leaked on YouTube. It is called "Fairweather Fan". In an interview, it was revealed that Four Year Strong would be playing the Warped Tour 2012.
As of May 15, 2012, Four Year Strong parted ways with their label Universal Motown/Universal Republic. Regardless of the departure of the label, the band is still active as they played at the 2012 Warped Tour, and they performed with Blink-182 on their UK and Ireland tour. As of 2013, rumors have speculated if Four Year Strong had broken up. O'Connor had been married to his wife for almost two years, and Day started his side project The Here and Now, an alternative/blues group who released an EP of music that year. When interviewed by PropertyOfZack, Day mentioned that the band isn't breaking up but rather taking time off. Going further, he said, "This is the first time in five years or more that we've taken more than three weeks off on tour...We're definitely not breaking up. It seems like a lot of people are saying that, but I don't know why they're saying that. Just because we haven't come through your city three times this year doesn't mean we're broken up."


=== Signing to Pure Noise Records, Go Down in History EP and Self-titled album (2014–2016) ===
During their annual holiday show in Worcester, MA in 2013, Four Year Strong announced they were working on new material set to be released at a later date.

They kick off their Go Down in History tour on November 1, 2014, accompanied by Transit, Such Gold, and Seaway.
The band's self-titled album was released on June 2, 2015. The album was produced by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou. Vocalist/guitarist Dan O' Connor stated that the album was "one of the most raw records we've ever made, it's just us playing. No fancy computer shit. Made for singing along and head banging.".

== Musical style ==
The band's sound can be described as a blend of pop-punk and hardcore punk. The band simply developed their sound off the idea of playing 'exactly what they want to hear' or music that they would listen to, but no one else was playing at the time. The band's sound has been described as a "combination of pop-punk energy, uplifting singalong choruses, and metalcore flourishes". with "assertive and (relatively speaking) intricate guitar lines and riffs". This fusion between pop punk and metalcore has been often labeled as "easycore", a style the band is considered to have popularized alongside New Found Glory.
