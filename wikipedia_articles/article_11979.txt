Valley View Winery is a winery in the Applegate Valley AVA in Southern Oregon, United States, founded in 1972.


== History ==
The original Valley View Vineyard was started by photographer Peter Britt in 1854 and was located in the gold rush town of Jacksonville in the Rogue Valley. Britt produced wines under the Valley View label until his death in 1906.
In 1971, Frank Wisnovsky and his family purchased 76 acres (310,000 m2) in the Applegate Valley and planted 12 acres (49,000 m2) of grapes in the spring of 1972. In 1974, Valley View planted 14 acres (57,000 m2) more. The original 26 acres (110,000 m2) of vineyards consisted of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Gew√ºrztraminer. Valley View's first two vintages, which consisted of Cabernet Sauvignon, were produced by Tualatin Vineyard in the Willamette Valley. In 1980, Frank Wisnovsky died in a drowning accident at Lost Creek Lake. He is survived by wife Ann along with their daughter Joanne and their sons Robert, Mark and Michael. The winery has been operated by Ann, Mark and Michael since 1990.  Ann passed away in 2023 at 91 and is acknowledged as one of the pioneers of the Oregon wine industry. Mark and Michael became owners of Valley View in 2005. 
The winery won a Double Gold medal for the 1990 Chardonnay in the World Wine Championships in Ljubljana, Slovenia.  With the 1990 vintage, the winery began using the Anna Maria label for its best wines in honor of the founding mother Ann Wisnovsky.
Syrah, Viognier and the Spanish variety Tempranillo are currently the main focus, along with late harvest wines including a port-style wine.
