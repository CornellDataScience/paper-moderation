Haakon Arntzen leaves the Yukon Party caucus after investigations into several sexual assault cases in the 70's and the 80's began. While serving as an independent, he was found guilty. The Opposition called for his resignation, however this was rebuffed by the Government who believed he should be sentenced first.
