=== Views on Tibet ===
When discussing the Chinese Communist Party's repression against Tibet, Tang argued that it would only push more Tibetans to advocate for autonomy and even independence from the central government.
"Tibet is disappearing. The spirit which makes her beautiful and peaceful is disappearing. She is becoming us, becoming what she does not want to become. What other choice does she have when facing the anxiety of being alienated? To hold onto her tradition and culture, and revive her ancient civilization? Or to commit suicidal acts which will only add to Han nationalists’ bloody, shameful glory?"
