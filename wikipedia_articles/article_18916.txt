== Views ==


=== Kurios in the LXX ===
Pietersma has proposed that the original Septuagint did not contain the tetragrammaton, but that it has been included as a result of a Hebraized recensions, and "he argues that an analysis of the translation technique used by the LXX traducteurs when they dealt with certain instances of the Hebrew tetragram suggests that they used Kúrios to render it". Sean M. McDonough, Natalio Fernández Marcos and others have accepted Pietersma's thesis. On the other hand, Pierre-Maurice Bogaert, Martin Hengel, Emanuel Tov and others do not accept Pietersma's theory.
