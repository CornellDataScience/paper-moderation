Horizon Chase is a racing video game developed and published by Brazilian company Aquiris Game Studio. It was released on August 20, 2015, for iOS and Android platforms. It is a 3D game inspired by 2D, 16-bit titles like Top Gear. Its soundtrack has Nintendocore influences.
In 2019, an enhanced version, Horizon Chase Turbo, was released for Windows, Linux, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation Vita, the latter via a Play-Asia physical release and one of the last of such for the system. A sequel, Horizon Chase 2, launched for Apple Arcade on September 6, 2022, with releases for the Microsoft Windows and the Nintendo Switch in 2023.


== Gameplay ==
In Horizon Chase, the player has to complete races on tracks located all around the world. The player has to pickup fuel refills on the track, in order to continue playing. The player also has to collect coins, as currency, to unlock new tracks. The player can also use nitro boosts to speed up their car. Like a standard race, the player starts every race at the back, and needs to overtake opponents to win. Different weather effects and track types can affect handling and the difficulty of driving.
In the Senna Forever DLC, which also adds a first-person view, players can race Formula One cars in a campaign inspired by Ayrton Senna's career in the sport, with some Grand Prix venues being adapted to the game.


== Development ==
The game's soundtrack was composed by Barry Leitch, who was contacted due to his work on Top Gear, a racing game released in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The soundtrack of that game was popular among Brazilian fans, leading to a remix contest. The remixes were later released as part of the soundtrack and a cover of the popular Las Vegas track from Top Gear was included as an Easter Egg.
All versions of Horizon Chase except the PlayStation Vita also has an Ayrton Senna DLC, with profits being donated to the Ayrton Senna Institute.


=== Easter eggs ===
The game's composer also included a hidden marriage proposal to his longtime girlfriend in the game with the assistance of the development team, which was discovered by fans but kept secret until he was ready to share the story.
