== Mixed martial arts career ==


=== Early career ===
Cholish made his professional MMA debut in September 2007.  He lost his first fight via submission, but won his next seven fights before signing with the UFC.


=== Strikeforce ===
Cholish made his Strikeforce debut in February 2011 as part of the preliminary card for Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Silva. He defeated The Ultimate Fighter veteran Marc Stevens via submission (kneebar) in the second round. Cholish drew considerable attention from MMA news sites for the submission due to its rarity.


=== Ultimate Fighting Championship ===
Cholish made his promotional debut against Mitch Clarke on December 10, 2011, at UFC 140. He won the fight via TKO in the second round.
Cholish faced Danny Castillo on May 5, 2012, at UFC on Fox 3. He was defeated by Castillo via unanimous decision.
Cholish was expected to face Yves Edwards on December 8, 2012, at UFC on Fox 5.  However, Cholish was forced out of the bout with a groin injury and replaced by Jeremy Stephens.
Cholish next faced Gleison Tibau on May 18, 2013, at UFC on FX 8. He lost the fight via submission in the second round. After the fight Cholish retired from MMA, citing low pay as the reason for his retirement.

"I'm fortunate enough that I have a job that provides for me really well, I give a lot of these guys credit that fight at this level. I think they could be compensated much better based on the income that the UFC takes in. Fortunately, I can just walk away and I'm OK with it. By no means do I mean it disrespectfully toward any other fighters because I think they do a great job. But hopefully Zuffa and the UFC will start paying them a little better."


== Personal life ==
Cholish, a Cornell University graduate, holds a full-time job with the Marex Spectron which brokers commodities of natural gas crude oil on the institutional platform.
