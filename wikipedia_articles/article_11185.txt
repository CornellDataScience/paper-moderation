In 2014, Trumbull ran to succeed incumbent State Representative Jimmy Patronis, who was unable to seek re-election due to term limits. He faced former Bay County School Board Member Thelma Rohan, Melissa Hagan, and Tho Bishop in the Republican primary, where he campaigned on his support for making Florida "the most business-friendly place in the country," which he said was achievable with lower taxes, less government regulation, and lawsuit reform.
Trumbull won the primary with 43% of the vote to Rohan's 24%, Hagan's 23%, and Bishop's 10%, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Jamie Shepard, the Democratic nominee, and Henry Newman Lawrence, the Green Party nominee. He campaigned as a supporter of lower taxes and reduced regulation, and voiced his opposition to the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Trumbull won the general election with 69% of the vote to Shepard's 28% and Newman's 3%.
