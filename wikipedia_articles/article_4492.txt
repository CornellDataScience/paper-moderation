Live at Wolf Trap is the third live album by US rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 2004.
Wolf Trap is a National Park in Virginia, where the band performed live on July 25.
In addition to the CD, a DVD was released featuring, in addition to the CD setlist, "People Gotta Love Again", "Spirit", "Nobody", "Neal's Fandango", "Takin' It to the Streets" and "Without You", interviews, a photo gallery and other bonus features.
The album was also released as a double LP vinyl set, same tracklist as the CD version.
The album revived a handful of tracks the Doobies had not released live versions of before from Tom Johnston's original stint with the band. The set also included a cover of the rock and roll standard "Little Bitty Pretty One".
The album contains the final recordings of drummer and vocalist Keith Knudsen, who died shortly after its release.
