The International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) is an international youth labour organization, whose activities include publications, supporting member organizations and organization of meetings. Originally named the Socialist Youth International, the union was formed at the 1907 International Socialist Congress at Stuttgart as the youth wing of the Second International.
IUSY claims to have 145 member organizations, including 122 full members and 23 observer members, from 106 countries. IUSY gained prominence as an international youth non-governmental organization (NGO) with UN ECOSOC consultative status in 1993.


== History ==
From 24 to 27 August 1907, 21 youth representatives from 13 countries met in Stuttgart and found the Socialist Youth International as the youth organization of the Second International, headquartered in Vienna.
The Socialist Youth International held parallel congresses in 1910 and 1912 following the International Socialist Congress, Copenhagen 1910 and International Socialist Congress, Basel 1912.
The socialist youth organizations were confronted by the onset of World War I in 1914. The majority of the socialist parties supported their respective countries' war efforts, but the Socialist Youth International remained opposed to it. The organization moved its offices to Zurich and published its journal, Youth International, calling for peace (distributed illegally). This anti-war activism later became a core part of the organization.
The formation of the Communist International in Moscow in 1919 split the worldwide socialist movement into communist, socialist and socdem wings. An alliance between the socialist and socdem wings resulted in a return of Socialist Youth International in 1923.
After the fascist takeover of Italy, the totalitarian government barred Italian Youth from being a part of the organization. This spurred action for anti-fascist causes in the organization. After the Second World War, the organization formally rebranded to become the International Union of Socialist Youth. In the 1950s and 1960s, the group supported decolonization efforts in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s, the organization fought against human rights violations by military governments in South America. Today, the group mostly focuses on economic policy.


== Activities ==
The stated goal of the International Union of Socialist Youth is to promote anti-war activities, fight climate change, and support socialist economic policies. The organization supports the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.
