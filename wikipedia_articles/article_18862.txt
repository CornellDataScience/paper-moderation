The Calendar of the Church Year is the liturgical calendar found in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer and in Lesser Feasts and Fasts, with additions made at recent General Conventions.
The veneration of saints in the Episcopal Church (United States) is a continuation of an ancient tradition from the early Church which honors important and influential people of the Christian faith. The usage of the term saint is similar to Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions. Episcopalians believe in the communion of saints in prayer and as such the Episcopal liturgical calendar accommodates feasts for saints.


== Significance ==
The Calendar of the Church Year, as found in the authorized editions of the Book of Common Prayer and Lesser Feasts and Fasts, is the official calendar of The Episcopal Church.
There is no single calendar for the various churches which are part of  the Anglican Communion; each makes its own calendar suitable for its local situation. Calendars in different provinces of the Anglican Communion will focus on figures more important to their own provinces. As a result, The Calendar of the Church Year contains a number of figures important in the history of the church in the United States, as well as figures of regional or global significance.
Different provinces often borrow important figures from each other's calendars, as the international importance of those figures become more prominent in their own provinces. In this way the calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States has importance beyond just the immediate purpose of supporting the liturgy of the American church.
Because of its relation to the Episcopal Church of the United States, the Episcopal Church in the Philippines follows The Calendar of the Church Year rather closely.
The Calendar of the Church Year is one of the key sources of the calendar for the international daily office Oremus.


== Sources ==
The Calendar of the Church Year is found in the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, in which it was simply called "The Calendar", and in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, in which it bears its present name of "The Calendar of the Church Year".  At present, the 1979 prayer book—and, by extension, its liturgical calendar—is the only one which is authorized for use.  In some jurisdictions, the 1928 prayer book may be used with permission, along with the liturgical calendar of the 1979 prayer book.
Since 1964, the Episcopal Church has published additional books which expand the liturgical calendar.  Most of these have borne the title Lesser Feasts and Fasts, although some have borne other titles.  These books include:

Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 1964
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 1973
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 1980
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 1988
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 1994
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 1997
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 2000
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 2003
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 2006
Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints, 2010
A Great Cloud of Witnesses, 2015
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 2018
Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 2022
The additions to the liturgical calendar, as published in these books, do not remain fixed from edition to edition.  New observances are introduced for "trial use" in a newly published edition, then may be kept or removed in subsequent editions.  Those which have remained in use for two consecutive editions, and which are to be kept thereafter, become permanent additions to the liturgical calendar, and are always included in subsequent editions.
The 2018 edition of the Lesser Feasts and Fasts was formally authorized for use at the 2022 General Convention.  The 2006 edition of the Lesser Feasts and Fasts, which remains in popular use in traditional congregations, remains authorized for use as well.  "The Calendar of the Church Year" as found in the authorized editions of the Book of Common Prayer and the Lesser Feasts and Fasts are the only authorized liturgical calendars for the Episcopal Church.


== History ==


=== Early calendars ===
When the Episcopal Church separated from the Church of England, it created a new version of the Book of Common Prayer. It listed only 25 holy days assigned to a specific date, nearly all of them honoring New Testament persons or events. This was similar to the 16th century prayer books and in contrast to England's prayer book in use at the time of the American Revolution. That prayer book had 93 holy dates, including the feast of Charles I, martyr, and the feast of the Restoration of Charles II. It added a feast to honor Civil and Religious Liberty on July 4.
The calendar changed little in the 1892 revision of the Book of Common Prayer.
In the early 20th century, the Episcopal Church planned a revision to the book. The Commission of the Book of Common Prayer made official reports in 1916, 1919, and 1922 recommending the addition of 45 to 54 holy days. None of those were accepted, and the 1928 prayer book included none of the recommendations.


=== 20th-century revisions ===
Starting in 1950, the Standing Liturgical Commission released sixteen Prayer Book Studies during the process of creating what eventually became the Book of Common Prayer (1979). Two of those studies proposed new sanctoral calendars for the church.
Prayer Book Study IX was published in 1957. It proposed more than 80 new feasts to the calendar, including new major feasts for the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, Saint Mary Magdalene and Holy Cross Day.
Prayer Book Study XVI was published in 1964 as Lesser Feasts and Fasts. It was the first publication to bear that name, and also marked the first time feasts were approved for "trial use." It included more than 25 feasts that were not part of the 1957 publication. A second edition of Lesser Feasts and Fasts was published in 1973, added more than a dozen additional feasts. It was also authorized for trial use.
The first Lesser Feasts and Fasts calendar given final approval was the 1980 edition. Its calendar was published in the Book of Common Prayer's list of optional observances.
Lesser Feasts and Fasts was revised every three years when the General Convention met. Delegates to the convention submitted names to the calendar in the form of resolutions. The convention then voted to either reject a proposed feast, refer it to the Standing Commission on Liturgy to consider, add it to the calendar on a trial basis, or give it final approval. For example, the General Convention asked the committee to consider a feast for Hildegard of Bingen in 1991. It approved her feast on a trial basis in 1994 and gave it final approval in 1997.


=== 21st-century revisions ===
In 2003, the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music began extensive work on calendar revision. It was charged with increasing the cultural diversity of the church's calendar. At the time, women made up about 7% of commemorations and most dates honored white male clergy.
In 2009, the General Convention authorized a new calendar for trial use, called Holy Women, Holy Men. The book had more than 100 additional commemorations to honor a variety of historical persons such as poet Christina Rossetti, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, and the Dorchester Chaplains. It increased the percentage of women represented by only 9 percentage points and was less racially diverse than past calendars.
Holy Women, Holy Men was approved with additions for three years of trial use again in 2012, with additions. It was never given final approval.
In 2015, the commission submitted a new volume, A Great Cloud of Witnesses. It was envisioned as a replacement for Holy Women, Holy Men, and was introduced after study and collection opinion from Episcopalians online. The text of A Great Cloud of Witnesses stated that it was not intended to be a calendar of saints, but "an extended family history." The 2015 General Convention voted to make it available, but did not authorize it for trial use.
In 2018, the commission released a report saying the calendar had been thrown into a "situation of great confusion." It proposed a new calendar that updated Lesser Feasts and Fasts 2006, the last publication that had met with final authorization. It increased the percentages of women and laypersons to roughly 50%. The 2018 General Convention approved Lesser Feasts and Fasts for trial use.
The 2022, General Convention gave final authorization to the more than 90 feasts days that had been added as part of the Lesser Feasts and Fasts 2018 trial use calendar. This represented the largest number of additions to the calendar at a single general convention since 1979.
In 2024, General Convention finalized the removal of William Porcher DuBose from the calendar. It also finalized three feasts that had been under trial use since 2022.


== Fixed dates ==


=== Ranking of observances ===
The Episcopal Church's Book of Common Prayer identifies four categories of feasts: Principal Feasts, other Feasts of our Lord (including Sundays), other Major Feasts, and minor feasts. Two major fast days are also listed (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday). In addition to these categories, further distinctions are made between feasts, to determine the precedence of feasts used when more than one feast falls on the same day. In addition, Lesser Feasts and Fasts gives further rules for the relative ranking of feasts and fasts. These rules of precedence all establish a ranking, from most to least important, as follows:

Principal Feasts
The Feasts of the Holy Name, the Presentation, and Transfiguration
Sundays through the year
Ash Wednesday and Good Friday
Feasts of our Lord
Other Major Feasts
Weekdays of Lent
Minor feasts


=== Days of fasting and prayer ===
Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are appointed as major fast days with special services. "Days of special observance" or lesser fast days include all the weekdays of Lent and every Friday in the year, with the exception that fasting is never observed during the Easter or Christmas seasons, or on Feasts of our Lord. The Episcopal Church does not prescribe the specific manner of observance of these days.
Other days for prayer and optional fasting include rogation days, traditionally observed on April 25 and the three weekdays before Ascension Day, as well as the sets of Ember days four times each year.


=== Baptismal feasts ===
The Great Vigil of Easter, Pentecost, All Saints' Day, and The Baptism of our Lord, are appointed as baptismal feasts. It is preferred that baptism be reserved for those occasions.


== Calendar ==
Principal Feasts are in BOLD, ALL CAPS. Feasts of our Lord are in bold italics. Other Major Feasts and Fasts are in bold. Appropriate Collects and Prayers for use in celebrating the commemorations are in brackets.


=== Movable days ===
The following observances occur on different dates depending on the date of Easter. 

Ash Wednesday
Good Friday
EASTER DAY
ASCENSION DAY
DAY OF PENTECOST
The First Book of Common Prayer, 1549, observed on a weekday following Pentecost
TRINITY SUNDAY
Thanksgiving Day is a feast on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States which may be celebrated on another day elsewhere. In addition, every Sunday in the year is observed as a "feast of our Lord".
