It forms part of Durham University's sports facilities as well as hosting local sports clubs. The Racecourse cricket ground, which has hosted first class matches, has been used since at least 1843, and is the home ground of Durham University's cricket team. The Racecourse also contains squash, tennis and fives courts, rugby, hockey and football pitches, and boathouses.

== History ==
Before it was a racecourse, the Racecourse was known as Smelt Haugh or Smiddy Haughs and is thought to have been a smithy for the Prior of Durham. It was first recorded as being used for horse racing in 1733. At its peak, the course had a stone grandstand and attracted 80,000 spectators for a two-day event in 1873. Racing continued at the site until around 1887. From 1815 there was an annual boat procession along the River Wear at the Racecourse, celebrating Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo. In 1834 this became the Durham Regatta, the second oldest regatta in England. The Durham Miners' Gala (established 1871) has been held annually at the Racecourse since 1872.
Cricket has been played on the Racecourse since at least 1843, when Durham University played the first recorded game there. This predates Cambridge's first game at Fenner's (1848) and Oxford's first game at  The Parks (1881), making the Racecourse the oldest university cricket ground in England. In the 1840s the land was owned by the Bishop of Chester, who leased it to Durham City Cricket Club (established in 1829) in 1844. By the late 1840s, however, the lease had passed to the university. Durham City Cricket Club continued to play at The Racecourse cricket ground until 1887, when they moved "amid mutterings of discontent" to Green Lane Cricket Ground at the east end of the Racecourse. Horse racing was also stopped by the university at the same time, so from 1888 the ground was solely used by the university.

On 16–17 June 2012 the Racecourse hosted the Olympic torch as part of the London 2012 Olympic torch relay.


== Cricket ground ==

The Racecourse's most significant facility is its cricket ground, which has been used by Durham University since 1843. It has a capacity of 8,500 (2015).
The Racecourse cricket ground stands at the east end of the Racecourse. It hosted Durham County Cricket Club's first competitive match as a first-class county in 1992, against Leicestershire in the Sunday League, watched by a crowd of "somewhere close to 10,000". Between 1992 and 1994, Durham CCC played seven games there in the County Championship, seven List A games and a three-day game against Australia, which was notable for being Ian Botham's last match as a professional cricketer. Since Durham CCC moved into The Riverside Ground, which was completed in 1995, the ground has continued to host Durham University, Durham University Centre of Cricketing Excellence and Durham MCC University matches, which included 19 first-class matches against County sides as well as games in the MCC Universities Championship and BUCS Premier League. It was also used from 2000 - 2008 as the home for Durham
CCC's Academy team, which played 50 North East Premier League matches on the ground. In 2007, it also hosted a three-day match between the touring West Indies team and the MCC. and a one-day match between the MCC and the touring Bangladesh A team in 2008. It hosted two women's one-day internationals in 2002 and a Durham Women one-day match against Lancashire Women in 2014, retrospectively considered to have been List A matches.
The ground has hosted 28 first-class matches (excluding one abandoned without play) and 12 List A matches as of August 2022. It has also hosted four Second XI Championship matches as of August 2024: three for Durham County Second XI in 2006, 2007 and 2023 and one in 2011 with Marylebone Cricket Club Universities as the home team.
