Tuscola Area Airport (IATA: TZC, ICAO: KCFS, FAA LID: CFS, formerly 78D) is a public use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) southwest of the central business district of Caro, a city in Tuscola County, Michigan, United States. It is owned by the Tuscola Area Airport Authority. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017â€“2021, in which it is categorized as a local general aviation facility.
Many U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA. However, this airport is assigned CFS by the FAA but has been assigned TZC from the IATA.

Note that CFS was assigned to Coffs Harbour Airport in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Australia.


== Facilities and aircraft ==
Tuscola Area Airport covers an area of 260 acres (110 ha) at an elevation of 701 feet (214 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways: 5/23 is 4,300 by 75 feet (1,311 x 23 m) with an asphalt pavement; 12/30 is 2,300 by 110 feet (701 x 34 m) with a turf surface. The airport is not staffed regularly.
