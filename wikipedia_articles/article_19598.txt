The 2000–01 FIBA Saporta Cup was the thirty-fifth edition of FIBA's 2nd-tier level European-wide professional club basketball competition. It occurred between October 17, 2000, and April 17, 2001. The final was held at Hala Torwar, Warsaw, Poland.


== Competition system ==
24 teams (national domestic cup champions, plus the best qualified teams in the most important European national domestic leagues), entered a preliminary group stage, divided into four groups of six teams each, playing a round-robin. The final standing were based on individual wins and defeats. In case of a tie between two or more teams, after the group stage, the following criteria were used to decide the final classification: 1) number of wins in one-to-one games between the teams; 2) basket average between the teams; 3) general basket average within the group.
The top four teams from each group qualified for a 1/8 Final Playoff (X-pairings, home and away games), while the winners advanced further to 1/4 Finals and 1/2 Finals.
The Final was played at a predetermined venue.
