Maurice Slevin is a British medical oncologist specialising in the treatment of breast, ovarian and gastrointestinal cancers. He has made contributions to the field through both his clinical practise and research. He practised at St Bartholomew's Hospital and was a founding partner of Leaders in Oncology Care (LOC) on Harley Street.


== Education ==
Slevin graduated from the University of Cape Town and completed his postgraduate training at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town and St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, where he worked as head of chemotherapy for solid cancers. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.


== Career ==
His research primarily focused on clinical pharmacology, with particular emphasis on etoposide and cytosine arabinoside, as well as psychosocial oncology. He has published over 150 peer-reviewed papers in academic journals and has an h-index of 58.
He helped establish the cancer support charity Cancerbackup, which he chaired from 1985 to 2008, when it merged with Macmillan.
Slevin and his colleagues carried out a study, funded by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, which showed that cancer patients were more likely to opt for radical and intensive treatment with minimal chance of benefit than were their doctors.
Slevin gained attention for his controversial papers on the National Health Service (NHS), where he argued that reform was more crucial than increased funding. He suggested that the NHS had almost as many managers as nurses, a claim that was slammed by the NHS federation. He led a movement in 2000 demanding a wholesale overhaul of NHS treatment of the disease, along with Karol Sikora, in which they argued for faster cancer treatment timelines.
Slevin was a founder member of Doctors for Reform, a group of 1000 consultants who advocated a social insurance model of funding the NHS.
