The journal publishes research in ethical and philosophical issues emerging from the cognitive sciences, social sciences, and affective sciences, neurosciences, comparative psychology, clinical psychology, psychopathology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, educational psychology, health psychology, analytic philosophy, moral psychology, phenomenology, history of psychology, and experimental philosophy.
According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2021 impact factor of 1.573.
Since January 2021, Philosophical Psychology subscribes to the British Philosophical Association Good Practice Scheme and to the Barcelona Principles for a Globally Inclusive Philosophy, taking steps to ensure that members of underrepresented groups in academic philosophy (such as women and non-native speakers of English) are involved as journal editors, editorial board members, authors, and readers.

Philosophical Psychology has calls for papers on topics of interest to the general public that can be investigated by philosophers and psychologists, such as collective irrationalities, bias, and trustworthiness.
