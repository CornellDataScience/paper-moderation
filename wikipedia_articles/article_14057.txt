Mary Elizabeth Lynch Pillion (January 18, 1921 â€“ June 8, 1990) was an American chemist with the United States Army from the late 1940s into the 1970s.


== Early life ==
Elizabeth Lynch was from Lawrence, Massachusetts, the daughter of Michael Francis Lynch and Abigail F. Scott Lynch.


== Career ==
Pillion was a chemist at the United States Army's Quartermaster Research and Engineering Command in Natick, Massachusetts. Much of her work involved studying storage and cleaning methods for feeding and hydration systems in extreme environments. In 1962 she received the Research Directors' Award for her work on a spectrophotometric correction technique for identifying ingredients in disinfectants and other solutions.
Pillion's research was published in scholarly journals including Analytical Chemistry, Journal of Chromatographic Science, Military Medicine, and Applied Microbiology.
