When a truck collides with the car his brother Angshuman Roy and he are in, Debraj goes into a coma. Except for his family, everyone else presumes that he is killed in the accident. Years later, his son Abhiraj "Abhi" Roy is a police officer in Mumbai who fights against the mafia and is on a mission to apprehend a mafia don Guru Nayak who is involved in illegal drug trade, extortion and arms trafficking.
When he heads to Kuala Lumpur in an undercover operation, he meets Pooja, the daughter of Abhi's senior police officer, Madhusudan Bakshi and soon falls in love with her. She initially rejects his advances which makes him give up. However, he is successful in the undercover operation and arrests Nayak's brother Bunty. After returning to India, he again meets Pooja and, to his surprise, she reciprocates his feelings. In an attempt to arrest Nayak, Bunty and the police commissioner is killed and Debraj's loyal follower Shivu reveals to Abhi that Nayak, along with Debraj's rival, Apurba Ghosh, and Debraj's other followers including Jagganath and Krishnakanto Mitro were behind Debraj's accident, which makes Abhi plot to kill them all.
When Debraj comes out of the coma, the doctors who treated him advise his family that his life is at risk if he encounters or hears anything upsetting, disturbing or shocking. Abhi hides the events surrounding the accident and shifts his family to his previously abandoned mansion which is now being used for film-making. Abhi creates a dummy political set-up at this mansion. In the guise of a reality television program, Abhi tricks an aspiring but unsuccessful film actor Swarnakamal by making him believe that the television show is being sponsored by actor Mithun Chakraborty's television show, and that Mithun Chakraborty wants to offer Swarnakamal very high remuneration for his realistic performance in the show. On the other hand, an aspiring actor Premjit and Apurba Ghosh are tricked by Abhi with a real estate business deal to exploit his criminal nexus.
Abhi keeps this drama under wraps from Debraj by making him believe that Abhi is also an MLA revered by people fulfilling his father's wishes. He marries Pooja after gaining her family's consent much to Debraj's delight. Meanwhile, Abhi manages to kill Jogonnath and Apurba without the knowledge of anybody while Debraj believes that they died due to ailments. Nayak reaches Kolkata to kill Abhi and Abhi's drama is exposed before everybody except Debraj. Abhi killed Guru Nayak's gang members and others in an encounter while Nayak is later killed in a Ramlila event. Debraj too learns of Abhi's drama and is happy for the affection his son showed on him.
