J. & D. Shearer was an engineering and farm machinery manufacturer based in Mannum between 1882 and 1912, founded by John (1845–1932) and David Shearer (1850–1936), and continued separately as John Shearer & Sons of Kilkenny, South Australia, and David Shearer & Co. (later David Shearer Ltd.) of Mannum.


== History ==
John and David Shearer were two of a family of six children born to Peter Shearer (c. 1808 – 31 July 1891) and his wife Mary (c. 1814 – 28 May 1908) in Orkney. The family migrated to South Australia in the Omega, arriving in South Australia on 24 August 1852, living first at Port Adelaide, where their father pursued his trade of stonemason,  then at Clare,  where the youngest boys attended the local school.
At the age of twelve David left to work on a property at Hoyleton, and after two years enrolled with J. S. Cole's Stanley Grammar School in Watervale for a year's tuition; the fees paid for out of his savings. He then worked for two years at his brother William's blacksmith shop at Leasingham. At age 18 he went to work in W. Patterson & Co.'s foundry in Clare. When that business failed he moved to the other end of town where J. G. Ramsay of Mount Barker had a workshop.
.
John served his apprenticeship with J. G. Ramsay, a farming implement merchant and manufacturer of Mount Barker and in 1876 set up a workshop and smithy in Mannum, where David joined him in 1877, repairing farm equipment and paddle-steamers. Between 1877 and 1904 they designed and manufactured agricultural equipment. In 1888 they started manufacture of a wrought ploughshare using a resilient grade of steel developed for him by Meadow's company in England. A similar steel, "Resiflex" was produced by BHP Steel in the 1920s. He invented a stump-jumping plough which he manufactured from 1884.
The company John Shearer and Sons was registered in 1923.
A visitor to the business in 1908, and again in 1910 with a parliamentary committee, said the company had trouble keeping up with demand for their products. He noted strippers made by the firm were lined up outside the factory on the banks of the Murray River awaiting shipment by paddle steamer and barge.
In 1904 the two partners, each wishing to concentrate on their own specialities, separated as far as manufacturing was concerned, then dissolved their partnership in 1910.

== Legacy ==
David Shearer's steam car, also known as the Shearer Steam Car, was built in Mannum and completed in 1899. In 1900 it was driven to Adelaide city centre and back. It was the third steam car to be built in Australia. It was presented by his grandson, Peter W. Shearer, to the people of South Australia in November 1975. It has been restored, and is an exhibit at the National Motor Museum, Birdwood. The design of the perpetual trophy for the winners of the "Concours d’Elegance" is based on the car, and held at the museum.
The John Shearer Memorial Gates and the David Shearer Sports Park, both in Mannum, were named for the two brothers.
