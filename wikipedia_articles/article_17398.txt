The mission statement of the IGLTA Foundation (2019): The IGLTA Foundation supports the mission of IGLTA and its members through education, research and leadership development that benefits the global LGBTQ+ tourism industry.
Founded in 2012 with the support of the IGLTA Foundation founding partner Delta Air Lines, the IGLTA Foundation is the 501(c)(3) organization and public charity subsidiary of the International LGBTQ+ Travel Association. The IGLTA Foundation supports initiatives for industry organizations, leaders and communities to advance LGBTQ+ travel around the world. A board of directors governs the IGLTA Foundation, overseeing the organization's strategy and direction. The IGLTA Foundation Board of Directors operates by a standard of bylaws.
Areas of activity for the IGLTA Foundation focus on "leadership", research, and education.
The IGLTA Foundation encourages governments and tourism industry leaders to make LGBTQ+ travelers feel safe and welcome. The IGLTA Foundation provides resources for IGLTA to engage with other non-governmental organizations as well as governments and tourism boards to speak on the positive economic and cultural impact of LGBTQ+ tourism. The IGLTA Foundation is also an official partner of ECPAT International (formerly End Child Prostitution And Trafficking).
The IGLTA Foundation funds research to promote understanding of LGBTQ+ travel within the global tourism industry.

The IGLTA Foundation also supports scholarships for students and small business owners to attend the annual IGLTA Global Convention.


== Trump controversy ==
On July 5, 2015, the IGLTA sent an email to its members announcing the addition of its newest member businesses. The email included three Trump-branded properties: Trump SoHo New York, Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago, and Trump International Hotel & Tower New York. This was not the first time the IGLTA had included Trump-branded properties. A Change.org petition dating to 2011 encouraged the organization to "Dump Trump Properties".
On July 7, 2017, the IGLTA gave an official statement to the Windy City Times, IGLTA President/CEO John Tanzella said, "IGLTA is a member-based travel association promoting LGBTQ friendly travel options. IGLTA also aims to support and educate businesses that want to better respond to the needs of LGBTQ clients. "The Trump branded properties which are current members of IGLTA (2017) are independently owned hotels and not owned by Mr. Trump."
Donald Trump has spoken out against LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. As President of the United States, he was the first president since George W. Bush to not acknowledge June as Pride Month.
Few people have expressed concern surrounding the topic, despite the differences between the President of the United States and non-affiliated, privately owned, LGBTQ-friendly travel accommodations. On June 20, Trump's Chicago hotel was briefly illuminated in rainbow colors, presumably in recognition of Pride celebrations the following weekend. NBC 5 tweeted a photo of the display.
