The 2017 Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship (commonly abbreviated as BTCC) was a motor racing championship for production-based touring cars held across England and Scotland. The championship featured a mix of professional motor racing teams and privately funded amateur drivers competing in highly modified versions of family cars which are sold to the general public and conform to the technical regulations for the championship. The 2017 season was the 60th British Touring Car Championship season and the seventh season for cars conforming to the Next Generation Touring Car (NGTC) technical specification.
With both BMW and Vauxhall returning to the series this year as manufacturer outfits - joining the existing Honda, Subaru and MG teams, the 2017 season featured five manufacturer backed teams on the grid for the first time since the end of the popular Super Touring era of the sport.
With a maximum grid of 32 cars for the 2017 season, a full entry list was announced which sees a total of 18 different named teams.
