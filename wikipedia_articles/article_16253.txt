== Places of interest ==
Some notable places to visit include the Tiger Hill (a panoramic view of Mount Everest and Mount Kanchenjunga together), the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park (notable for conservation of red pandas), monasteries and the tea gardens. The town attracts trekkers and sportsmen seeking to explore the Himalayas, serving as the starting point for climbing attempts on some Indian and Nepali peaks. Tenzing Norgay, one of the two men to first climb Mount Everest, spent most of his adult life in the Sherpa community in Darjeeling. His success provided the impetus to establish the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling in 1954. In the Tibetan Refugee Self Help Centre, Tibetan crafts like carpets, wood and leather work are displayed. Colonial architecture is exemplified in Darjeeling by cottages, St. Andrew's Church, Darjeeling Gothic churches, Planters' Club, the Raj Bhawan and various educational institutions. Several monasteries like Ghoom Monastery (8 km or 5 miles from the town), Bhutia Busty monastery, Mag-Dhog Yolmowa preserve ancient Buddhist scripts.  A Peace Pagoda was built in 1992 by the Japanese Buddhist organisation Nipponzan Myohoji. The Mahakal Temple on Observatory Hill is a pilgrimage site for Hindu and Buddhists.  Although tourists have come to Darjeeling in vastly greater numbers after India's economic liberalisation, they have spent less on average, resulting in Darjeeling's luxury tourism increasingly to give way to mass tourism. Since 2012, Darjeeling has once again witnessed a steady inflow of both domestic and international tourists. As of 2015, around 50,000 foreign and 500,000 domestic tourists visit Darjeeling each year, the so-called "Queen of the Hills" continuing to appeal strongly to the imagination of tourists.
