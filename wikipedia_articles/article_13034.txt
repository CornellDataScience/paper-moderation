== Content ==
In the first verse, Cro praises his rapping skills by comparing himself to Jay-Z and saying that he creates his instrumentals himself. He then changes the subject to the relationship with a woman and he gives reasons that would lead to him break up with her, such as marriage and pregnancy. In the end, he does leave her and is happy that she is no longer there.
In the lyrics, the word "easy" appears at the end of each verse, with a word that is based on it. For example, the words AC/DC and the phrase "erschie√ü sie" become "AC/D-Easy" and "ersch-Easy." The song does not have an actual chorus.


== Production ==
Cro produced the beat for "Easy" himself and used a sample of Bobby Hebb's song "Sunny" and also modeled the lyrics after this song. The track reached Platinum in October 2012.


== Music video ==
The music video for "Easy" was directed by Harris Hodovic and premiered on YouTube on 23 November 2011.
