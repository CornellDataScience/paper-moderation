FC Bayern Munich is a German professional women's football team based in Munich, Bavaria. They currently play in the Frauen-Bundesliga, the top women's league in Germany.


== History ==
Bayern's women's football team was officially founded in 1970 although women had been playing at the club since 1967. However, because the DFB had outlawed women's football from 1955 to 1970 Bayern could only officially register the team in 1970. They won their first national championship in 1976. In 1990 Bayern were founding members of the Frauen-Bundesliga, but they were relegated after next season.
The club returned to the Bundesliga in 2000. In 2009, Bayern were runners-up in the Bundesliga, trailing champion Turbine Potsdam by a single goal. In the 2011–12 season on 12 May 2012, FC Bayern Munich dethroned the German Cup title holders 1. FFC Frankfurt with a 2–0 in the 2011–12 final in Cologne and celebrated the biggest success of the club's history since winning the championship in 1976. In 2015 they won the Bundesliga for the first time, without any defeat. They won the 2015–16 Bundesliga, for the second time in a row.
In May 2023, Bayern Munich celebrated a double championship when both the women's team and the men's team won the top national football leagues within 2 days. An 11–1 win over Turbine Potsdam on the final day of the season secured the FCB women their fourth Bundesliga championship and their fifth national championship overall, marking the club's biggest win in history.
