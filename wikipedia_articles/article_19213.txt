not to be confused with Winifred S Carter, an American celebrity chef and cookery author also active from the 1920s–40s.

Winifred Carter (c. 1883–1949) was an English author and playwright, who was particularly active from the 1920s–40s.


== Life ==
Carter was the mother of the mystery and detective novel author Emery Bonett and the wife of novelist John L. Carter and actress and playwright Edith Carter.
Winifred Carter's most successful work was probably her 1945 novel Princess Fitz, which was made into a 1947 film Mrs. Fitzherbert.
It is a romance set in 1783, which chronicles the convoluted, yet ultimately doomed, relationship between a prince regent and a Catholic widow (Mrs Fitzherbert).
