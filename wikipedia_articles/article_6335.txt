Matthew Graham McKay (born 11 January 1983) is a retired Australian professional footballer who last played for Australian A-League club Brisbane Roar, and previously with the Australian national team. 
McKay currently holds the club's record for league appearances, 272. McKay played for Brisbane Roar since their first season in the A-League, and was their club captain up until the 2010–11 season, in which he led Brisbane to their first ever A-League championship and premiership. Following this triumphant victory McKay sought a new challenge in the first division of the Scottish Premiership with Rangers. McKay played an integral role in Australia's second placing in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup notably with 30m cross to centre forward Harry Kewell. He was also part of the Australian squad at the 2014 World Cup and 2015 AFC Asian Cup.


== Club career ==
McKay spent his formative youth years at both the QAS and AIS.  McKay's first club signing was in 1991 for the Sunnybank Saints Soccer Club, competing under the Queensland Christian Soccer Association. McKay was signed by NSL team the Brisbane Strikers in 2001, where he stayed until the conclusion of the 2003–04 National Soccer League season. McKay's last game for the Strikers was a 4–1 Victory over Adelaide United in the Elimination Final #1 as the Strikers could only level the tie 4–4 and bow out of the finals on away goals.


=== Brisbane Roar ===
McKay signed on as an inaugural member of the, then, Queensland Roar prior to the 2005–06 season – the first in the history of the A-League. McKay was given the number 17 shirt, which he has retained throughout his career at the Roar. Initially signed as a squad player behind the more established South Korean duo Hyuk-Su Seo and Tae-Yong Shin, McKay quickly got his opportunity due to a career-ending injury suffered by Shin in the clubs' first ever A-League fixture, against the now defunct, New Zealand Knights. Following the departure of club captain, Craig Moore midway through the 2009–10 season, McKay was named as club captain. He has played the highest number of games for the Roar with 184 appearances, scoring 21 goals.
McKay led Brisbane to their first A-League premiership and championship in 2011. The Roar topped the table, and continued their record-breaking 28-game (run finished at 36) unbeaten run with a miraculous 4–2 (2–2 aet) penalty shoot-out win over the Central Coast Mariners in the 2011 A-League Grand Final. It was reported after the match that a stirring speech by McKay at half-time in extra time boosted the Roar's morale sufficiently to unbelievably overcome a 2–0 deficit.
During his time at Brisbane Roar, McKay had a loan spell in 2009 during the A-League off season.. He joined Changchun Yatai F.C. in the Chinese Super League where he made 15 appearances.


=== Rangers ===

On 10 January 2012, McKay played and scored in a 4–1 Premier League win over Scottish Premier League team Kilmarnock F.C. he celebrated the goal like he won the league which wasn’t greeted with the same response with a small minority of rangers fans who called his celebrations embarrassing. On 12 January 2012, it was reported that he had rejected the chance to go on loan to Al Ittihad who reportedly made an offer to Rangers of a loan-to-buy deal.


=== Busan IPark ===
Rangers began to have financial problems and on 14 February 2012 a dispute with HMRC came to a head when the business was placed into administration. Rangers were deducted 10 points as per SPL rules, which left them 14 points behind leaders Celtic.
On 22 February 2012, Rangers confirmed that they had agreed a fee with South Korean club Busan IPark for midfielder Matt McKay.


=== Changchun Yatai ===
In January 2013, McKay signed a two-year deal with Chinese Super League side Changchun Yatai. In July 2013, McKay mutually terminated his contract by the club.

He was named in the starting 11 for both the final group stage match against Bahrain and the subsequent quarter-final match against Iraq, and played a vital role in the latter, leading Australia to a 1–0 extra time victory, executing an inch-perfect cross for striker Harry Kewell to head into the goal for the match winner. McKay retained his starting position for the semi-final against Uzbekistan, and was again a key player for Australia in the team's 6–0 win, setting up three goals and being awarded man of the match.
