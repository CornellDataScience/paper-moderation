=== Background ===
The NWA Anniversary Show is a professional wrestling event held by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). The first event was held in 1998 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1948 founding of the NWA. The event then continued to be held annually until 2005. It has since been held periodically, with shows held in 2008, 2018, 2021, and 2022.
At the NWA 74th Anniversary Show, Billy Corgan announced that the NWA 75th Anniversary Show would take place across two nights on August 26 and 27, 2023, in St. Louis, Missouri, from the Chase's Khorassan Ballroom.


=== Storylines ===
The event featured professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines are produced during the fourteenth season of the NWA's weekly series, Powerrr.
On the July 11 episode of Powerrr, after EC3 successfully defended the NWA National Heavyweight Championship, he dropped the title in the ring, officially relinquishing it to challenge Tyrus for the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship at NWA 75. Over two weeks later, Tyrus requested that the match be made a bullrope match given the history between him and EC3 stemming across Impact Wrestling and WWE. He also proposed the stipulation that he would retire should he lose the match.
On Night 2 of the Crockett Cup, Colby Corino won a Seven-Way Scramble to earn an NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship match against champion Kerry Morton at NWA 75. The match would take place on Night 1.
On the July 11 episode of Powerrr, the NWA announced the NWA United States Tag Team Championship Showdown, a four-team tournament to determine the number one contenders to champions The Country Gentlemen (AJ Cazana and Anthony Andrews) on Night 2 of NWA 75. The tournament began the following week, with The Fixers (Jay Bradley and Wrecking Ball Legursky) and Daisy Kill and Talos advancing to the finals, which will take place on Night 1 of NWA 75.
On the July 25 episode of Powerrr, Jax Dane lost to Carnage by countout. After the match, commentator Tim Storm commented on how had never seen Dane look so vulnerable to which Dane angrily confronted Storm about it. Two weeks later, Dane confronted Storm at the commentary table again, challenging him to a match at NWA 75, which storm accepted. The match would be made a no disqualification match
On the August 8 episode of Powerrr, Ella Envy defeated Missa Kate to earn Pretty Empowered (Envy and Kylie Paige) an NWA World Women's Tag Team Championship match against M95 (Kate and Madi Wrenkowski) at NWA 75.
