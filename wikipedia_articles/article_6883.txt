== History ==
Lissendorf lies on the former Roman road between Trier and Cologne (Via Agrippa). Many sideroads favoured settlement in this area in Roman times. Roman graves that have been unearthed confirm this.
Lissendorf had its first documentary mention in Prüm Abbey’s directory of holdings, the Prümer Urbar, in 893. In the Middle Ages, a noble house named “von Lissendorf” was mentioned. This family never attained greatness outside this region, though.
Beginning in the 14th century, the village found itself in the hands of the House of Manderscheid-Blankenheim. In the 16th century, the village belonged to the County of Gerolstein. In the time of French rule, Lissendorf became the seat of the cantonal administration.
By the end of the 19th century, the local railway, the Eifelbahn between Trier and Cologne, had opened.


== Politics ==


=== Municipal council ===
The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The 16 seats are shared among three voters’ groups.


=== Mayor ===
Lissendorf’s mayor is Rudolf Mathey.


=== Coat of arms ===
The German blazon reads: In Grün das goldene Geweih mit Grind eines Achtenders.
The municipality’s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Vert a stag’s attires, each with four points, fixed to the scalp Or.
The noble family von Lissendorf, mentioned above, bore arms with this charge. the stag’s attires (that is, antlers) fixed to the scalp, but it was no longer known what the correct tinctures were. The municipality simply chose vert (green) and Or (gold).
