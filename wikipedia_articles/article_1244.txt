== History ==
Although records are obscure but according to traditions, around 17th century a branch of Kadamba dynasty of the Bonai State was ruling in the region and the chiefs were feudatories of the Bamra State until the 18th century, when the rulers of the Sambalpur State freed it from its dependence.
During the 19th century, Raja Bishan Chandra Jenamuni whose reign lasted 75 years, was recognized as Raja and in 1867 a sanad was granted by the British recognizing Rairakhol as a state in its own right. The state was under the political control of the Commissioner of the Chhattisgarh Division of the Central Provinces until 1905, coming then under the Bengal Presidency. His successor Gaura Chandra Deo adopted Bir Chandra Jadumani Deo Jenamuni, a scion of the Kadamba dynasty branch of Bonai as his successor. On 1 January 1948, he signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union. The princely state then became part of the Sambalpur district.
