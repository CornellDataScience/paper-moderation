It was filmed between 5 April and 26 April 1948. The serial's production number was 1700.
This was the fourth of only four 13-chapter serials to be released by Republic. The previous three were released in 1947, the only original serials released in that year.

Adventures of Frank and Jesse James' official release date is 30 October 1948, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges.
This was followed by a re-release of Darkest Africa, re-titled as King of Jungleland, instead of a new serial. The next new serial, Federal Agents vs. Underworld, Inc., followed in 1949.
The serial was re-released on 16 April 1956 between the similar re-releases of Manhunt of Mystery Island and King of the Rocket Men. The last original Republic serial release was King of the Carnival in 1955.
