Valintino Mayowa Adedokun (born 14 February 2003) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a left back for Nemzeti Bajnokság I club Diósgyőr, on loan from Premier League club Brentford.
Adedokun is a product of the Malahide United and Dundalk youth systems and began his senior career at the latter club, before transferring to Brentford in 2021. He was capped by the Republic of Ireland at youth level.


== Club career ==


=== Dundalk ===
After beginning his career in the River Valley Rangers and Malahide United youth systems, Adedokun moved into the Dundalk academy in 2017 and progressed to sign his first professional contract in January 2020. He won his maiden first team call up for a League of Ireland Premier Division match versus Shamrock Rovers on 27 September 2020 and made his debut as a substitute for Will Patching late in the 4–0 defeat. Adedokun signed a new two-year contract in January 2021. During the 2021 season, Adedokun was a regular inclusion in matchday squads as a substitute and made seven appearances (four of them starts), before departing Oriel Park in August 2021. During his time with Dundalk, Adedokun was converted from a winger to a left back.


=== Brentford ===


==== 2021–2023 ====
On 24 August 2021, Adedokun transferred to the B team at Premier League club Brentford and signed three-year contract, with the option of a further year, for an undisclosed fee. During the 2021–22 season, he gained experience as a left wing back, participated in first team training sessions and was a member of the B team's London Senior Cup-winning squad.
After missing much of the 2022–23 pre-season due to COVID-19 and a dislocated shoulder, Adedokun's 37 appearances during the regular season was the most of any B team player. He appeared in every minute of the B team's victorious 2022–23 Premier League Cup-winning campaign and made a first team mid-season friendly appearance.


==== 2023–24 ====
Adedokun's first team involvement continued during the 2023–24 pre-season, with one substitute appearance. Due to a season-ending injury suffered by first team left back Rico Henry and with no specialist backup available for stand-in Aaron Hickey (who himself then suffered a season-ending injury), Adedokun was an unused substitute on seven occasions during the first half of the regular season. Adedokun captained the B team during the 2023–24 season and signed a new two-year contract, with a one-year option, in February 2024. His performances in his 34 appearances during the 2023–24 season were recognised with the B team Player of the Year award.


==== 2024–25 and loan to Diósgyőr ====
On 23 September 2024, Adedokun joined Hungarian Nemzeti Bajnokság I club Diósgyőr on loan until the end of the 2024–25 season.


== International career ==
Adedokun is eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland or Nigeria at international level. He was capped once by the Republic of Ireland at U15 level and was later named a standby for a pair of U17 friendlies versus Switzerland in March 2020. Adedokun was called into U19 training camps in June, September and October 2021, with the latter camp including a pair of friendly matches versus Sweden, both of which he appeared in. Adedokun's third and final U19 cap came as a substitute late in a 1–1 2022 European U19 Championship qualifying draw with Bosnia and Herzegovina on 13 November 2021.
