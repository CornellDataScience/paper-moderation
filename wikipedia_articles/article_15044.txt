In the 2005–2006 school year, 94 students attended Rochelle Zell, and the number increased to 132 students in the 2007–2008 school year, along with many new faculty members. Due to growth in its student body, Rochelle Zell moved from its Morton Grove campus to a high school in Deerfield in Fall 2007.
In 2015, the school received a donation from the Zell Family Foundation and subsequently changed its name to Rochelle Zell Jewish High School.
For the 2019–2020 school year, enrollment was nearly 180 students drawn from over 20 communities throughout Chicago and its suburbs. Roughly three-quarters of current students advance to Rochelle Zell from Jewish day schools. The remaining students attend local public and private schools before transferring to Rochelle Zell.
