== Background ==
House of Miracles is Brandon Lake's debut solo project with Bethel Music, having joined the label in 2019. Lake stated that theme of the album was drawn from his divine calling that his family was embracing, saying: A few years ago, God gave my wife and me a vision for our home to become a place to host couples and people in ministry who were burned out. I saw us worshipping with, affirming and praying for those who were hurting, and I felt that through our home God was calling us to set an atmosphere where miracles can happen in people’s lives.
In an interview with American Songwriter, Lake further explained that the heart behind the album was to remind the listener that experiencing the presence of God transcends the church setting, saying, “He also wants you to become a house of miracles, by the things that you say and the way that you live, you too can experience that.” Lake also noted the contrast of instrumentation of the lead single, "I Need a Ghost" with the other songs of the album, describing it as an to the dynamic aspects of a personal relationship with God which encompasses different emotions and conversations, and exploring the different facets of God.
