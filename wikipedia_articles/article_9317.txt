== Miscellaneous ==
Palermaa is one of few bowlers at the professional level to use two different styles in regular play. Although he primarily uses the two handed "shovel" style, which gives him a high RPM (revolutions per minute) rate, he also employs a conventional one-handed style for certain situations. Palermaa is oftentimes regarded as the "world's strongest bowler" given that his ball speed exceeds most pros by nearly 10 miles per hour at times.
