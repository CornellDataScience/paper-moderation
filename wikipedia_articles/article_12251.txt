== Career ==
Xander Rawlins, also known as Alex Rawlins (full first name Alexander), attended Bedford School, Bedford, England and Oxford Brookes University. After graduation from University, he attended The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst commissioning into the Grenadier Guards in 2007. In 2009, he deployed to Afghanistan as an Infantry platoon commander with 30 men under his command.
BBC Three television broadcast a documentary series entitled Our War: 10 years in Afghanistan. The second episode of the three-episode series contained coverage of Captain Alex Rawlins filming and interviewing his men from 1st Battalion, the Grenadier Guards about their experiences, and captures events surrounding the loss of Guardsman Jamie Janes, a soldier from his platoon, who had died on 5 October 2009 stepping on an IED. Janes' death became a turning point in the British public's awareness of the human cost of Improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The documentary Our War won "Best Documentary Series" and "Best Multichannel Programme" at the Broadcast Awards 2012, and a BAFTA for "Best Factual Series".
Rawlins began writing and recording music as a teenager. He co-created music with lifelong friend Sam Phillips, under the name "The RawLips". In 2005, whilst at university in Oxford, Rawlins formed the band "Pulling Claudia" (later changed to "The Rawlins") with Phillips on lead, brother Digby on keys, Henry Latham on drums and Ben Dimond on bass. In 2009, Rawlins, while still in Afghanistan, started singing in his platoon made band "The Renegade Irritations", also nicknamed "The Helmand Philharmonic" as lead vocalist and guitarist to entertain the soldiers. 
In 2020 Rawlins released the album "10 Years", so titled as it contained multiple songs that had been recorded in Los Angeles a decade prior, but that had never been released. The EP "Alive I Dream (The Lost Songs") was released in 2024. 


=== "1000 Miles Apart" ===

Rawlins started writing "1000 Miles Apart" in England and finished it while on the front in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in Christmas 2009. A tribute to Jamie Janes, it was about a soldier being far away in the battlefield and longing to be home for Christmas. The recording with extra footage from the battalion soldiers themselves was meant to be sent by them to their families and friends. British Forces Broadcasting Service radio and television, the British Forces News and mainstream news networks and newspapers promoted the release of 1000 Miles Apart as a contender to the aspired No. 1 on Christmas. All proceeds were pledged to Army Benevolent Fund The Soldiers' Charity (ABF) and to the Combat Stress charity for serving men and women suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues.


=== Soldier in Blue ===
In 2012, Rawlins co-founded Soldier in Blue, a consultancy firm specialising in providing serving and ex-service personnel and their dependents to the entertainment industry as extras and advisors. They have worked on such productions as the musical Les Miserables, the programme Monuments Men, the BBC documentary Our World War, the films Fury, Testament of Youth, Suffragette and the Star Wars saga.
