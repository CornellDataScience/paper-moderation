Tom Corbett, Space Cadet is an American TV series that aired 1950–1955, depicting the character Tom Corbett. Episodes were 15 minutes (weekdays) and 30 minutes (Saturdays).


== Origin ==
The initial concept for the series followed the scripts by Joseph Greene originally proposed as a comic strip in 1945, and then as a proposed radio serial in 1946, titled "Space Cadets" (with a young hero named Tom Ranger), and 1947, titled "Space Academy". When Greene began work with Rockhill Studios on developing his idea into a television show in 1949, the title Tom Ranger, Space Cadet was floated for a time.
In 1950, Rockhill Studios licensed the “Space Cadet” name from Robert A. Heinlein's 1948 young-adult novel Space Cadet for the series then in development.
The initial installment of the series was edited into the 88 minute long The Mercurian Invasion, which was released in 1998.


== Cast ==
Tom Corbett – Frankie Thomas Jr.
Astro – Al Markim: A Venusian cadet
Roger Manning – Jan Merlin: A smug, egotistical cadet with an inordinately high opinion of his own abilities, although he occasionally proved himself to be nearly as skilled as he imagined himself to be. Roger occasionally made condescending, racist remarks about Astro but gradually came to like and respect the Venusian, although he sometimes maintained his bigoted attitude as a distancing mechanism (October 1950-May 1954).

Cadet Alfie Higgins – John Fiedler
