Des Moines County is located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 38,910. The county seat and largest city is Burlington. It is one of Iowa's two original counties along with Dubuque County; both were organized by the Michigan Territorial legislature in 1834. Des Moines County is part of the Burlington, IA–IL Micropolitan Statistical Area.
Des Moines County should not be confused with the city of Des Moines, which is the capital of Iowa. Des Moines County sits on Iowa's eastern border alongside the Mississippi River. The city of Des Moines is in Polk County in central Iowa. Both places derive their name from the Des Moines River, which flows through the city of Des Moines and originally flowed through the county. When the county was divided early in Iowa's history, the river ended up further west, forming the border between Lee County, Iowa and the state of Missouri.


== History ==
At an extra session of the Sixth Legislative Assembly of Michigan Territory held in September 1834, the Iowa District was divided into two counties by running a line due west from the lower end of Rock Island in the Mississippi River. The territory north of this line (which started just south of the present-day Davenport) was named Dubuque County, and all south of it was Demoine County. It was named after the Des Moines River. From July 3, 1836, until July 3, 1838, Des Moines County was part of Wisconsin Territory. The county underwent various border changes during this time. July 4, 1838, the named county became part of Iowa Territory (later the state of Iowa).
The current Des Moines County Court House was completed in 1940. The Iowa Army Ammunition Plant was also established in 1940.

== Politics ==
From 1896 through 1960, Des Moines County was a primarily Republican county, backing Democratic nominees only four times in the period (Woodrow Wilson in 1912, with a low plurality; Franklin Roosevelt in his two landslides in 1932 and 1936; and Harry Truman in 1948). From 1964 through 2012, it became a Democratic stronghold, backing the Democratic nominee in every election in this period save in Nixon's 1972 landslide. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican since 1972 to carry the county, despite narrowly losing the overall national popular vote; the county swung over 25% in his favor relative to its 2012 vote. The change to the GOP happened while the county experienced an economic decline. In 2020 and 2024, Trump again carried the county, with an increased vote share each time, the first time the county has voted Republican three times in a row since between 1952 and 1960.
