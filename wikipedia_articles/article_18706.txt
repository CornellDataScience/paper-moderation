The Copa MX, formerly called Copa México and Copa Corona MX (for sponsorship reasons), was the Mexican football cup tournament. The first season of the professional era was held in 1942–43. The cup tournament was not held in several years (1976–1988, 1992–1994, 1997–2012) and currently the competition has been paused since the 2019–20 edition.
It was the first tournament that included teams from different parts of Mexico and was considered a prestigious competition, especially during its earlier years of existence. The purpose of the competition was to determine a national cup champion, thus distinguishing it from the national league championship. Its format was different from the local leagues as well, as it employed direct elimination and culminated in a final match.
In May 2012, Liga MX president Decio de María announced the return and rebranding of the tournament as Copa MX.


== History ==


=== Amateur era ===


==== Copa México (1932–1942) ====
After the foundation of the Federación Mexicana de Fútbol in 1927, a new trophy named the Copa México was donated in 1932 and the first cup tournament organized by the FMF was contested during the 1932-33 season. This time, the competition also received official support of President Lázaro Cárdenas. The first Copa México was won by Necaxa in a tournament of historical importance due to the adoption of new rules. This marked the beginning of an 11-year period that is referred to in retrospect as the Amateur era. Once again, Asturias dominated the championship, winning it a record five times during this period.


=== Professional era (1942–2020) ===


==== Copa México (1942–1997) ====
In the 1942–43 edition the professional era of the Copa México began, a period that would last until the competition's termination in 1997. At first, it was played among teams from the Liga Mayor, which is currently Liga MX. Beginning in 1950 the teams of the Segunda División de México were also included into the competition with the exception of the 1956–57, 1963–64, 1994–95 and 1995–96 editions.


==== Copa MX (2012–2020) ====
Upon its return in 2012, the newly rebranded Copa MX was played twice a year (Apertura and Clausura tournaments), concurrent with the two league tournaments. In the Apertura tournament, 14 of the Liga MX teams not involved in the CONCACAF Champions League, play alongside 14 of the Ascenso MX teams.  The 14 Ascenso MX teams were the 13 top point-earners from the season prior, plus the newly relegated team. The teams were placed into seven groups of 4. The seven group winners, plus the group runner-up with the highest point total, moved on to the quarterfinals.
Teams played 6 games in the group stage. Groups and home field advantage were determined by a blind draw.  For the group draw, Liga MX teams were placed in Pot A, while Ascenso MX teams were placed in Pot B. In the home field advantage draw, no team can have more than two home games in the group stage. A blind draw determined home field advantage in the knockout rounds.
In the Clausura tournament, the 11 Liga MX teams not involved in international tournaments, played alongside the 13 Ascenso MX teams with the highest point total from the previous short tournament. Both tournaments will have the same draw format and number of group games, KO rounds for both tournaments will be single-elimination.
The new format was played twice a year, concurrent with the two league tournaments. In the Apertura tournament, all Liga MX clubs will play alongside 12 of the Ascenso MX teams. The 12 Ascenso MX teams will be the 11 top point-earners from the season prior, plus the newly relegated team.  The teams will be placed into 8 groups of 3. The 8 group winners, plus the 8 group runners-up, move on to the new round (round of 16).
Teams will play four games in the group stage. Groups and home field advantage will be determined the draw by public at their annual draft. For the group draw, Liga MX teams' top 4 point-earners and Ascenso MX teams' top 4 point-earners will be placed in Pot A, while Liga MX teams' mid 4 point-earners and Ascenso MX teams' mid 4 point-earners will be placed in Pot B and Liga MX teams' last 4 point-earners and Ascenso MX teams' last 4 point-earners will be placed in Pot C. In the home field advantage draw, teams can have two home games in the group stage. A blind draw will determine home field advantage in the KO rounds.
From the 2019–20 season, the Copa MX will be played as a single tournament throughout the season. It will have the participation of 27 teams (15 from Liga MX and 12 from Ascenso MX) placed into nine groups of three. Respect to the development of the tournament, this maintains most of the 2016 format, except the division into two short tournaments. The group stage played between July and December, and the final phase played between January and April.
However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 final was postponed until November, and beforehand, it suspended play due to busy calendar issues, with the Mexican Football Federation giving preference to matches of the Mexico national football team in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, resulting in the cancellation of the 2020–21 season and the competition entering a new indefinite hiatus.


== Precursor tournaments ==


=== Copa Tower ===
The tournament began in 1907 with the donation of the trophy by Reginald Tower, who was at the time the British ambassador to Mexico. For this reason, it was called the Copa Tower. At first, the tournament only included clubs from Mexico City and surrounding areas. Pachuca won the inaugural tournament, in 1908, by defeating Reforma in the final.
In 1919, Real España won the cup for the third year straight and were allowed to keep the trophy permanently.
In all, the Copa Tower was contested 15 times with Real España winning in four times in all, the best performance of the competition.


=== Copa Eliminatoria ===
The tournament took place for the first time in 1920. The Copa Eliminatoria was contested 7 times between 1920 and 1928. 
Real España won it three times, the highest total of any club during this period.


== Results ==
The first national cup tournament organized by the FMF since its founding was the 1932–33 Copa México, in the cup's amateur era.
