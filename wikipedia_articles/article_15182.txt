== Covenant Players ==
Tanner founded nonprofit theater company Covenant Players in 1963. The company began with eight performers in Encino in 1963 and grew to an international organization touring globally in different languages. The company launched its international tour with performances in Canada in 1969. It then began to perform in Europe in 1971; Asia in 1972; Australia in 1973; Africa in 1981; and Latin America in 1985. Besides being the company's International Director, Tanner wrote over 3,500 plays. He was able to write more than 100 plays a year. He was also hands-on in training the performers, until he suffered a stroke in 1998. He continued to write plays even after the stroke.
The plays written by Tanner are modern morality stories based on New Testament themes. The tales tend to involve topics including drugs, family, schools, conflict resolution, and interpersonal relationships. Another major theme of the plays is war, because Tanner considered war to be “a proving ground of human character.” Some of Tanner’s plays teach virtue without including religious references, so they could be performed at public schools.
