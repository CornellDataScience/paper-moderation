On February 21, 2020, JoJo announced the Good to Know Tour, her planned sixth headlining and third major world tour in support of her fourth studio album. The tour was originally scheduled to travel throughout North America and Europe with the first leg initially beginning on April 21 at the Showbox in Seattle. On March 27, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the North American leg of the tour was rescheduled, with new dates running throughout November and December. JoJo stated: "Everyone’s safety and health of course comes first, and we have no choice but to do the right thing and reschedule for later this year. Until then we’ll dance and sing together virtually!". The tour was then set to kick off with the original European dates throughout the UK beginning in Dublin, Ireland on Aug. 31.
On January 15, 2021, the tour was cancelled altogether due to the uncertainty of the pandemic. In a statement JoJo said: "While there is new hope and positivity surrounding the COVID vaccine, there is still immense uncertainty about touring this year. With that being said, and after careful consideration, I have decided to cancel the good to know tour (both U.S. and U.K./Europe)... At this point there is no other choice and I am BEYOND sorry to anyone this might inconvenience".
In October 2021, JoJo embarked on the Trying Not to Think About It Tour  a six-date tour of the United States. On October 26, 2021, JoJo announced the "JoJo Tour 2022". JoJo said: “It felt so right being back onstage for those dates in October, and I can’t wait to do it on a bigger scale in more cities next year!". The tour was now in support of both JoJo's fourth studio album Good to Know (2020) and her sixth studio album Trying Not to Think About It (2021). The first leg of the 45-date trek kicked off on February 24, 2022, in Portland, Oregon, United States, making stops in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Nashville, Detroit, and Chicago, before concluding in Ottawa, Ontario on April 16, 2022. The second leg of the tour commenced on May 3 in London, England, heading to Scotland, Germany, Italy, and Denmark, before wrapping on May 30 in Stockholm, Sweden.
