== Biography ==
Cole was born into a Jewish family in New Haven, Connecticut. His father, Burton David Michel, died in a car accident in September 1953, when Cole was 4 years old. His father's death prompted a lifelong personal and academic inquiry into issues of spirituality, aging, and the question of what it means to grow old.
Cole married Letha Birkholtz in 1972 and had two children, Jacob and Emma. He was divorced and married Thelma Jean Goodrich in 2007. They live in Houston.


== Education ==
Cole studied philosophy as an undergraduate at Yale University. He graduated in 1971 under the mentorship of philosopher of religion Merold Westphal and political philosopher William McBride. He earned a master's degree in American intellectual history under the direction of Donald Meyer at Wesleyan University (1975) and a Ph.D. in history under the mentorship of Christopher Lasch at the  University of Rochester (1980). His dissertation examined the history of aging in middle-class America in mid-19th and early 20th centuries.

In 1982 Cole became a professor at UTMB Galveston, where he assisted his mentor, Ronald Carson, in developing the nation's first Ph.D. Program in medical humanities.
His 1993 book, The Journey of Life: A Cultural History of Aging in America]examined the tradition of European thought and art about aging, traced its evolution in America, and emphasized the absence of social and cultural meaning in later life.
In 1997 Cole wrote No Color is My Kind, the story of Eldrewey Stearns and the integration of Houston.
Cole and his student at the time,  Kate de Medeiros, taught Life Story Writing Workshops to groups of elders in Galveston from 1998 to 2003. The PBS film Life Stories was made about the workshops.
In 2004 Cole became the founding director of the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics.  With Ronald Carson and Nathan Carlin, he co-authored  Medical Humanities: An Introduction.
In 2018 Cole began training to become a Spiritual Director under Rabbi James Ponet. He was ordained in 2021 by Rabbi Ponet, Rabbi David Lyon, Rabbi Richard Address, Dr. Catherine Stephenson, Reverend Laura Mayo, and Dr. Thelma Jean Goodrich.
