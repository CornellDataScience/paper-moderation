Radosław Matusiak (Polish pronunciation: [raˈdɔswav maˈtuɕak]; born 1 January 1982) is a Polish former professional footballer who played as a striker.


== Club career ==
Matusiak's contribution at the senior national team level caught the eyes of a handful of clubs in Europe during the winter transfer window. Speculation of the Polish striker joining Italian side U.S. Città di Palermo, third-placed in the Serie A league at the time, was finally realized, when on 30 January 2007 he was announced with the rosanero, after having signed a 3.5-year contract with the Sicilian club worth nearly €2 million. After a couple of substitute appearances, Matusiak made his debut in the starting lineup on 13 May 2007 in a league match against Ascoli, promptly scoring his first Serie A goal.
On 24 August 2007 Matusiak signed a three-year contract with an option for a fourth with Dutch side SC Heerenveen. In January 2008, however, he returned to Poland, being loaned for the duration of the season to Wisła Kraków. In the summer of 2008 his contract with Heerenveen was canceled by mutual agreement. He spent the first half of the 2008–09 season pursuing interests outside of football but rejected media reports that he had retired from the sport. On 23 December 2008, he signed with Widzew Łódź, and since 21 August 2009 he has played for Cracovia Krakow, signing a two-year contract. On 18 January 2011, he signed a contract with Asteras Tripoli. After that unlucky period in Greece, in February 2012 he returned to his old club – Widzew Łódź. He became a free agent at the end of the 2011–12 season.


== International career ==
Matusiak was part of the Polish U-16 team which placed second at Euro U-16 Cup in 1999. In 2006, he got his first senior international cap. He got his first senior goal on 6 September 2006 in a Euro 2008 qualifier against Serbia. On 15 November he also scored the only goal in a qualification match against Belgium in Brussels, keeping alive his country's hopes of qualifying.
