Afro-Latinos or Afro–Latin Americans are Latin Americans who are descended from African slaves brought to Latin America and the Caribbean region during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, who made up 95% of all Africans brought to the Americas.Afro-Brazilians, Afro-Cubans, Afro-Dominicans, Afro-Hondurans, Afro-Panamanians, Afro–Puerto Ricans, Afro-Colombians, Afro-Mexicans and other Latin Americans are from these African slaves.The first Africans brought to the New World arrived on the island of Hispaniola (now divided between the Dominican Republic and Haiti). The majority were taken to Brazil. Only 5% of the Africans brought to the Americas went to North America, from whom African Americans are descended.
