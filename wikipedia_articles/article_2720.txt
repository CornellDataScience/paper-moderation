Debopriyaa Dutta of Screen Rant gave the film a positive review and rate it 2.5 stars out of 5 stars and she wrote: Sporting skilled choreographed action sequences, Castle Falls offers a mildly satisfying viewing experience despite a weak and muddled storyline. Jacob Walker of Starburst rate the film 3 out of 5 rating and praised the film's thrills, decent action and the chemistry of Lundgren and Adkins and he wrote: Once the action kicks off in the last third of the film, however, it’s loads of fun. Adkins delivers his modern blend of taekwondo kicks and MMA techniques with gusto, and the gunfights and battles are relentless until the end. Lundgren and Adkins work really well together, Dolph’s world-weariness complimenting Scott’s energy and determinism. You will be cheering this bromance on until the credits roll, they just needed to be on-screen together a little earlier.
Phil Hoad of The Guardian satisfied at the film and gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 and he wrote: Dolph Lundgren and Scott Adkins make a fine odd couple in this meatily satisfying action film - once it gets moving.
