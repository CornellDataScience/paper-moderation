The 2024–25 Indian Super League is the 11th season of the Indian Super League (ISL) and the 29th season of top-tier Indian football.
Mohun Bagan SG are the defending champions and Mumbai City are the defending cup winners.


== Changes from last season ==
This is the first season where it is no longer mandatory for ISL clubs to include at least one player from a member association of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).
Besides doing away with the Asian quota, the ISL has also increased the salary cap from Rs 16.5 crore to Rs to 18 crore, with two players, either domestic or international, from each club outside the salary cap. Until last season, only a marquee player's salary was outside the cap. The new guidelines will allow clubs to spend freely on international players, without having to worry about the salary cap.
As per the Asian Football Confederation roadmap, relegation was to start in the ISL from 2024-25, but the AIFF decided not to implement it this season.
New home grown player category has been added – up to 3 of whom can be excluded from the salary cap. The homegrown players are U-23 players who have been registered with a club for consecutive 3 years immediately preceding ISL 2024-25.
Maximum of one concussion substitution in a match per team, correspondingly the opposing team will receive an additional substitution opportunity.
Claim for wrongful dismissals for direct red cards (for obvious errors) has been introduced by AIFF and incorporated in the League Rules for ISL 2024-25.


== Teams ==
13 teams compete in the 11th season of Indian Super League: 12 from the previous season and one promoted from the 2023–24 I-League.
