On August 11, 2023, Colombian singer Karol G released a remix of the song alongside Cris MJ and Colombian singer Ryan Castro, as the sixth track on her second mixtape project, Mañana Será Bonito (Bichota Season).


=== Background ===
The release of "Una Noche en Medellín (Remix)" was first confirmed by Karol G on March 21, 2022, through an Instagram video teasing her verse and confirming the addition of Ryan Castro.
Soon after, controversy broke out when American singer De La Ghetto posted an Instagram video showing a verse he had for a different remix of the song, stating: "They want to take me off the remix, I can't let this happen." Cris MJ responded on the same post it was not up to him, stating: "That's not what happened brother, it's out of my hands. To the people that think it's up to me, it's not like that. It's up to the big leagues."
Later Karol G confirmed that her and her team had decided to not move forward with the remix, stating she was unaware of other artists and other remixes in the talks. She added: "I would like to clarify that at no time was I aware that other artists had recorded and that apparently there were several remixes discussed until two days ago when I announced it. My team and I value and respect the work of my colleagues, and although I love the project and hate that this type of things happen, we have decided not to move forward with the [release of the song].
For his part, MJ responded to De la Ghetto, saying that it was not his responsibility and that the decision was made by the Stars Music Chile label, which supported what MJ stated and claimed that the American artist was not part of the remix due to "a major industry decision," but then he deleted the statement.
In June 2022, in an interview for Los 40 radio in Colombia, Ryan Castro revealed that the remixed version of the song originally included MJ, Karol and him, but that the label decided to incorporate De la Ghetto. Due to the fact that the label did not notify the presence of another artist in the remix, Karol G made the decision not to publish the remix, despite not having any problem with De la Ghetto. The following month, in an interview by Chilean journalist Diego González, MJ announced that the remix would be released, although he did not confirm who the artists would be participating in.
