Ed Reed was coach of Brown University’s water polo team from 1971 to 1992, where he led the team to seventeen consecutive New England Championships between 1975-1991.  Prior to 1974, Brown's Water Polo team had been a Club Team, but achieved Varsity status that year.  Initially, he was also head coach of the varsity swim team at Brown.

As an undergraduate at Springfield College, Reed was a two-time All-American in swimming.  At the March 1965 New England Intercollegiate Championships in Cambridge he won the 200 Individual Medley with a New England Intercollegiate Swimming Association (NEISA) record time of 2:06.5 minutes.  In 1965, he also set a NEISA record of 4:42 minutes in the 400-yard IM.  He set school records in the Individual Medley, placed frequently in back stroke events, and served as team Co-Captain for Springfield in 1965.  His knowledge of the training required to obtain swimming speed would later be valuable in coaching both Water Polo teams and swim teams.
