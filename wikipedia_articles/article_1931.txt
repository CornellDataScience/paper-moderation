== Death ==
On June 2, 2022, the nephew of Kaiwan noticed that his uncle was displaying symptoms of jaundice. Concerned for his well-being, they promptly took him to Ramathibodi Hospital in Bangkok for medical attention. The doctors advised that Kaiwan needed to rest and take a break due to his condition. However, despite the doctor's recommendation and the concern expressed by relatives, Kaiwan remained preoccupied with his work commitments. He had a continuous stream of tasks, including performances, dubbing cartoons, and other professional obligations. Unfortunately, despite his relatives' pleas for him to take some time off, Kaiwan refused to heed their advice and continued to work tirelessly without allowing himself proper rest.
As a result of his relentless dedication, Kaiwan's health deteriorated, leading to episodes of seizures and trance-like symptoms on June 24, 2022. Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, his relatives came together to assist him and promptly brought him to Sam Chuk Hospital for treatment. Tragically, despite the efforts made by the medical staff, Kaiwan's condition worsened, ultimately resulting in his passing. The doctor identified the cause of the liver failure identified.
