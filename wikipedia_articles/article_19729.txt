== History ==


=== MOR (1959-196?) ===
In 1959, KFAB-FM signed on the air.  At first, it simulcasted co-owned KFAB.  The two stations broadcast a middle of the road format with popular music, news and sports.  From the 1950s through the 80s, KFAB-AM-FM were co-owned with the Lincoln Journal Star. 


=== Beautiful music (1960s-1970s) ===
In the late 1960s, KFAB-FM broke away from the AM station.  It carried a beautiful music format, featuring quarter-hour sweeps of mostly instrumental cover versions of popular music.


=== Adult contemporary (197?-1988) ===
In the 1970s, KFAB-FM switched to an automated adult contemporary format.  The station changed its call sign to KGOR in 1975 to differentiate it from KFAB. The station was the original home of the morning program Out of Bed with Jack and Fred, which premiered in 1985. It would go on to be a long running program on Omaha radio, and was the highest rated morning show for many years. The show left KGOR for competitor KEFM in 1989 due to a contract dispute.


=== Oldies (1988-2000s) ===
In November 1988, KGOR transitioned from AC to oldies, the first FM station in the format in Omaha.  (KOIL (1290 AM) was the first all oldies station in 1986.) KGOR became one of the highest rated stations in the city, ranking in the top five in the Arbitron ratings.  The format started out playing music from the 1950s-1960s, before moving to 1960s-1970s by the mid 1990s.
In 2000, KGOR and co-owned KFAB were acquired by Clear Channel Communications, the forerunner to today's iHeartMedia.  


=== Classic hits (2000s-present) ===
KGOR shifted away from its "oldies" branding in the early 2000s, trying to avoid the word "Old."  It started calling itself a "classic hits" station, focusing on the 1960s-1980s, mostly playing 1970s titles. By the 2010s, the playlist shifted to mostly 1980s hits, with some 70s and 90s titles included.
