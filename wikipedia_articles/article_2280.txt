Charles Birks & Co Ltd. was a South Australian department store founded by Charles Napier Birks in Rundle Street, Adelaide. His son Napier Birks took over the business in 1908. The business was acquired by David Jones Limited in 1954.


== History ==
Charles Napier Birks (13 February 1844 – 29 April 1924) was born in Knutsford, near Manchester, England, and emigrated with his parents Hannah Napier Birks (6 May 1807 – 13 August 1883) and Dr. George Vause Birks (c. 1815 – 31 January 1858) and family on the Leonidas, arriving at Glenelg, South Australia in December 1853. They settled in Angaston, where his father began practising. He died four years later, as a result of being thrown from his horse. Mrs Birks then ran a store in Angaston, assisted by her sons William and George, who as W. H & G. N. Birks later opened a stationery shop and Birks Chemists in Rundle Street.

Charles Birks & Co.
David Robin (c. 1835 – 24 February 1914) and Charles Birks, as Robin & Birks, took over the "London House" drapery shop at 89 Hindley Street from George Shaw (c. 1815 – 1895) in October 1864. Their next takeover was J. Ballantyne & Co.'s store at 38 Rundle Street in October 1871. The partnership was dissolved on 24 January 1876, when Robin took over the Hindley Street (At that time the major shopping strip and the more prestigious location) store, which in 1882/83 he sold to Joseph Henry Pellew (1854–1904).
Charles took the Rundle Street property, which he rebranded Charles Birks', and, assisted by Harry Ingham ( –1883), spared no expense in establishing the store at the upper end of the market. In 1879 he took his brother Walter Richard Birks (1847–1900) and William Honeywill (c. 1853–1929) into partnership, in 1881 rebranding the business as Charles Birks & Co.; Henry Joseph Bailey and George Mowat were later admitted.
Charles Birks retired from active involvement in 1884; Bailey and Mowat retired in 1886, and George bought out Walter's share shortly after. 
In 1888 a major building expansion was undertaken, at a cost of £25,000, perhaps $3M in today's values. In 1893 Charles's son Napier Kyffin Birks (1876–1953) was taken on as an office boy, then in 1900 was made a partner, then sole proprietor when Charles relinquished his share in 1908.
In 1913 Napier Birks purchased the whole of the Rundle Street frontage from Stephens Place to Gawler Place, and rebuilt the store. He appointed Frank Edward Cornish (1863–1930), who had been with the firm since age 12, as general manager, and when he enlisted in the Great War in July 1915 put Cornish in charge.
The firm was restructured as a limited liability company in late 1920, with Cornish appointed a director. Two new partners who bought into the company were Edmund Arnold Farr (died 1957) and William Gilbert Hayes (died 1926). In 1932 the company purchased the warehouse of Good, Toms & Co., increasing the total floor area to 4 acres (1.6 ha), and increasing Charles Birks & Co.'s frontage along Stephens Place and Gawler Place.
The business was acquired by David Jones Limited in 1954.
