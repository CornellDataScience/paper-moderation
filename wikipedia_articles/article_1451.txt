Xavier Landum (born May 12, 1998), better known by his stage name BigXthaPlug, is an American rapper and songwriter. He is currently signed to UnitedMasters and is best known for his songs "Texas", "Mmhmm", "Climate", "Levels" and "Whip It".


== Early life ==

Xavier Landum was born on May 12, 1998, in Dallas, Texas. He was raised in a challenging environment, the son of two street-dwellers, and recalls an early childhood marked by extremes. At the age of four or five, BigX witnessed his mother, whom he describes as a "gangsta", shoot at a would-be thief during an attempted robbery. While his mother was his best friend, his father took on the role of disciplinarian. Both parents also introduced him to a variety of music, from Isley Brothers and UGK to Drake and Lil Wayne, influencing his eclectic taste.  
BigX struggled in school from a young age, frequently skipping classes and getting into fights. By the time he was nine, he relocated to Commerce, Texas to live with his father. Football became an outlet for his aggression, and his skills on the field eventually earned him attention from Division 1 scouts. In 2016, after graduating from Ferris High School, he enrolled at Crown College in Minnesota. However, during his time there, BigX began selling marijuana to students, which led to police discovering his product in his dorm room. He was given a ticket and expelled from the school, ending his collegiate football ambitions.
Without stable employment, BigX turned to alternative means of making a living, including robbing drug dealers. His activities led to an arrest just before his 18th birthday on an aggravated robbery warrant. After violating his probation two years later, he was sent back to jail, where he missed his son's first birthdayâ€”a moment that deeply impacted him. While in solitary confinement, he battled boredom and frustration, leading him to write his first raps on a jail-issued medical form. Upon his release, BigX pursued music seriously, paying for studio time with money from street hustles and recording his first mixtape, Bacc from the Dead.


== Career ==
In 2022, he was arrested for illegal possession of weapons and marijuana and spent time in jail, where he wrote songs while in solitary confinement. After being released, he released his debut album Amar , named after his son, in February 2023, which includes the single "Texas", which was certified Gold by the RIAA. He launched his own label 600 Entertainment in 2023, signing rappers Ro$ama and Yung Hood. 
In October 2023, he released the single "Mmhmm". The song debuted at 93rd and reached 65th position on the Billboard Hot 100 two months after its release, after a remix with Finesse2tymes was featured on his EP The Biggest.
In 2023, he went on the Don't Mess With Texas Tour.
