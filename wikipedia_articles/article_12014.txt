== Fast X (Original Motion Picture Score) ==

Fast X (Original Motion Picture Score) is the film score album, featuring the original music composed by Brian Tyler, who called it as his "most complex" score in the franchise. As he described the antagonist Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) as "relatable" and "charming", for his theme, he used high strings such as the harp, and bass music with modern instruments as "it gives you this feeling that you can’t look away. There’s a sense [in his music] of empathizing with him, and why he becomes this villain." He also used an odd chord, describing it as "every time it happens and cycles around, that chord goes inside your brain to understand where the music is supposed to go. It’s like a dopamine hit, that’s different and reminds you there’s something off about him." The score was released by Back Lot Music on June 2, 2023.
