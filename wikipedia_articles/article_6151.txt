== History ==
The project was initially proposed in 1996 as a "mega resort" called Gold Rush City with theme parks, golf courses and private homes. After substantial criticism about building within a flood plain, the plan was changed to a planned community surrounded by wide levees. these levees go by  "Super levees", the district protecting part of Manteca, Lathrop east of the San Joaquín River, French Camp, and Stockton's Weston Ranch neighborhood is working toward a $270 million solution to upgrade to 200-year protection level as early as 2030. Since being proposed in 2001, the development has been delayed several years due to lawsuits, concerns about flooding, environmental impact issues and a downturn in the housing market. To address the issues of flooding, plans call for 18 miles (29 km) of 300-foot-wide (91 m) levees to surround the community. In 2003, Cambay Group settled lawsuits by the Sierra Club by establishing an $8.2 million trust for the protection of local farmland. In 2009, the development company stated that construction would be further delayed because of the downturn in the housing market.
