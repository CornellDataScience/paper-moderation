Prior to the 2002 contest, Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing Latvia two times since its first entry in 2000 with the song "My Star" performed by Brainstorm which placed 3rd. In the 2001 contest, it placed 18th with the song "Too Much" performed by Arnis Mednis.
