=== Pre-Division I (1930–1979) ===
For the first 50 years of their program, the Bethune–Cookman Wildcats men's basketball team competed in the NCAA Division II. During this era, it had eight different coaches. The most notable coach from this era was former Bethune–Cookman and Pittsburgh Steelers player Jack "Cy" McClairen. Some accomplishments during this era include qualifying for the NIBT tournament twice, the NAIA tournament once, and the NCAA Division II tournament three times. All of these post-season runs ended in defeat for Bethune–Cookman.


=== Division I era (1980–present) ===
After competing in NCAA Division II for 50 years, the team was invited to play in the NCAA Division I. In 2021, Bethune–Cookman accepted an invitation to join the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). Originally, the team played in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC). During this time, the only tournament the Wildcats have made is the NIT tournament. Though they now play in the NCAA Division I, they have never made a tournament appearance.
