Ganta Afeshum (Tigrinya: ጋንታ ኣፈሹም; also transliterated as Ganta ʾAfäšum) is one of the woredas in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. Part of the Misraqawi Zone, Ganta Afeshum is bordered on the south by Hawzen, on the west by the Mehakelegnaw (Central) Zone, on the north by Gulomahda, and on the east by Saesi Tsaedaemba. Towns in Ganta Afeshum include Bizet. Since the town of Adigrat split off Ganta Afeshum as a separate woreda, it is surrounded by this woreda.
There are several local monolithic churches in this woreda, which include Mariyam Si'it and Samuel Mayaba (abandoned as of 1970). High points in Genta Afeshum include Mount Alequa (3290 meters) and Mount Undale, part of the Mugulat Mountains.
