== Rights dispute ==
In recent years, distribution rights to the show have been the subject of litigation, in relation to the original licence holder, C/F International.  For example, as of December 2004, C/F International was a secured judgement creditor of Classic World Productions and it principal, Darryl Payne, for approximately one million dollars, and was the principal secured creditor at the time of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by the company, six months later.  C/F International's action against Classic World Productions and owner Darryl Payne was based on unpaid royalties in relation to "This Is Tom Jones", and related recordings.  The 1969-1971 "This Is Tom Jones" television shows are currently sold by Time-Life, rather than by Classic World Productions or C/F International.


== Home releases ==
A triple-DVD compilation of performances from the show, subtitled Rock 'n' Roll Legends, was released by Time Life Entertainment (under licence from Paul Brownstein Productions) on 26 June 2007, having previously been issued, in various forms, by Classic World Productions. It features performances from Richard Pryor, Mary Hopkin, Peter Sellers, The Who, Burt Bacharach, Anne Bancroft, Glen Campbell, Janis Joplin, Joe Cocker, Big Jim Sullivan, Little Richard, Stevie Wonder, Bob Hope and Aretha Franklin. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young were featured in early promotional copies, but these were withdrawn when rights issues prevented their performance being released; Little Richard was substituted for the final copies.
Another triple-DVD compilation of performances from the show, subtitled Legendary Performers, was released by Time Life on 12 February 2008. It features performances from Sammy Davis, Jr., Tony Bennett, Bobby Darin, David Steinberg, Liza Minnelli, Rich Little, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chet Atkins, Johnny Cash and June Carter.
