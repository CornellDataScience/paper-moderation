Supported by a strong promotional campaign, Soundbombing II performed significantly better commercially than other underground hip hop albums, peaking at number 30 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album's lead single, "One-Nine-Nine-Nine", also appeared on several charts.
Upon its release, Soundbombing II received widespread acclaim from music critics. In the years since its release, the album achieved a classic status, with music critics claiming that it perfectly captured the late 1990s era in underground hip hop. Soundbombing II was named by several publications as one of the best hip hop albums of all time.


== Background ==
By the late 1990s, Rawkus Records established itself in the underground hip hop community, with the releases such as Company Flow's Funcrusher Plus,
Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star, and the first Soundbombing compilation album. Following the success of the label's albums, Rawkus signed a few more artists and planned to release several albums in 1999. Soundbombing II was meant to be the foundation for the future releases.
In 1998, DJ Babu and J Rocc of Beat Junkies worked in a record store in Los Angeles. Rawkus artists Mos Def and Talib Kweli frequently visited the store. Eventually, Rawkus' founders Brian Brater and Jarret Myer approached Babu and J Rocc, asking them to help with mixing of Soundbombing II.


== Release ==
Soundbombing II was released on May 18, 1999, by Rawkus Records. Funded by James Murdoch, the son of billionaire Rupert Murdoch and a university friend of the label's founders, Rawkus was able to afford more promotion for the album than other underground hip hop labels. Apart from the full-page ads in music magazines, Rawkus also shot a music video for the track "1-9-9-9", DJ Babu and J Rocc made a special promo snippet mixtape, and BET's Rap City aired a special episode dedicated to Soundbombing II.
With all the promotion, Soundbombing II sold far greater than the label expected. The album charted on the Billboard 200, where it peaked at number 30, and on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, where it peaked at number 6. The single "One-Nine-Nine-Nine" reached number 10 on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, a 25-position extension to the Billboard Hot 100, number 41 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number 4 on Hot Rap Songs.
