He did fieldwork in 1947–48 in Anhui Province, China, and published his research in The Fabric of Chinese Society (1953).
His mentors were Julian Steward and Karl Wittfogel.
His cohort included Elman Service, Eric Wolf, Sidney Mintz and Stanley Diamond. His first graduate teaching assistant was Marvin Harris and his first graduate student was Marshall Sahlins.
He taught one semester at Yale University during the All Term of 1965. He was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan for one year, 1960–61.
