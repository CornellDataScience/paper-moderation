== Background ==
KajHa was founded on 15 March 1953 and in the early years the club was known as Hevossuon Haka.  The change to the current name was made on 23 January 1963.  Originally Haka was a typical village club, which in addition to football ran sections providing for sports of athletics, skiing, and volleyball. Specialisation in football occurred in the early 1960s and has remained the popular activity.  There are currently 245 registered players and the number is growing all the time.
The club's first taste of success was in 1968 when they played one season in the Suomisarjaa (Finland League) which at that time was the second tier of Finnish football.  They have had four other periods at this level, currently known as the Ykkönen (First Division) in 1970–71, 1985–86, 1993–94, 1998–99.
Haka have had nine periods covering 21 seasons in the Kakkonen (Second Division), the third tier of Finnish football covering 1975, 1979, 1981–84, 1987, 1990–92, 1995–97, 2000–05, 2007 and the current season 2010.
In 1999 KajHa won the Työväen Urheiluliiton Cup (Workers' Sports Federation Cup) for the first time in their history.
The attendance record for a KajHa match was the 1968 derby match with Kajaanin Palloilijat which was watched by 2,376 spectators.
