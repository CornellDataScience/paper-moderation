== History ==
Founded on 28 February 2001 in the IES Manuel Vázquez Montalbán (Sant Adrià de Besòs high school), by the gymnastics teacher, Núria Riera, and a group of students of the same center; the club's first match was played on 21 April 2001 in the sport complex called Marina-Besòs.
The club's name comes from the name that the high school's doorman used to call the first korfball players of the center ("korfbalers") and also of the fact that among that group of founding students there was not only boys and girls from Sant Adrià de Besòs, but also from Badalona ("union"). Since then the team has taken part season after season in official contests. At the beginning in low categories and afterwards in Second Division, where the club is at present.
At the moment the UKSA continues in its purpose of participating in the city life thanks to sport and the values that it transmits. In this line, the different activities and tournaments carried out in high schools and schools of the city have given a knowledge of korfball and of the club among the adrianencs, which has turned into an increasing influx to the senior team matches and into the creation of several groups of boys and girls in low categories.
