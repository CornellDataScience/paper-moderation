Christian Tramitz (born 29 July 1955) is a German actor and comedian.


== Early life ==
Born in Munich, Bavaria, Tramitz is the grandson of Austrian actor Paul Hörbiger and first cousin once removed of actress Christiane Hörbiger. His parents are film producer Rudolf Tramitz and Monica (née Hörbiger). Actress Mavie Hörbiger is a cousin.
Instead of starting an acting career at once, he first began to study history of art, philosophy and drama. Apart from that he took lessons in acting from Ruth von Zerboni and violin lessons in the Munich "Musikkonservatorium".


== Career ==
Tramitz made his first media experience at the Munich radio station "Radio Gong", where he, together with Michael "Bully" Herbig presented the program Die Bayern Cops. In December 1996, he appeared in the German television program Isar 3, which was based on the radio show Die Bayern Cops ("The Bavaria Cops"). From 1997 on, he was a member of the German comedy TV series Bullyparade with Herbig and Rick Kavanian.


=== Tramitz and Friends ===
After the end of Bullyparade in 2002, Tramitz got his first own comedy show named Tramitz and Friends on the  ProSieben in 2004.
In this show he performed different sketches with various other famous actors including Annett Fleischer, with whom he later filmed the TV series Hubert ohne Staller.


=== Voice acting ===
Tramitz used to dub various actors and voice acted different animated characters in the 1980s, like Matt Dillon (for example in Wild Things or One Night at McCool's), Captain Gray Edwards (Final Fantasy, originally spoken by Alec Baldwin), Jackie Chan (Half a Loaf of Kung Fu, Police Story 3), John Cusack (Class), John Ritter (Noises Off), Ben Stiller (If Lucy Fell), David Schwimmer (Six Days, Seven Nights) as well as Ted McGinley as Jefferson D'Arcy in Married... with Children, Jim J. Bullock as Neal Tanner in ALF, Greg Evigan as Jake Cardigan in TekWar as well as Stiletto Mafioso in Danger Mouse.
Apart from that he also gave the old Ted Mosby (narrator) in How I Met Your Mother, Asterix in Asterix and the Vikings and Chick Hicks in Cars his voice.
Thereupon he became the German voice cast of Scrad/Charlie (Johnny Knoxville) in Men in Black II.


== Private life ==
In 2004, Tramitz married his second wife, Annette, and has a daughter and a son with her. He also has twins from his first marriage to German publicist Christiane Tramitz. Christian Tramitz lives in Münsing at Lake Starnberg.
