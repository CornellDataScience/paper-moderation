Cudlee Creek is a small town near Adelaide, South Australia. It is located in the Adelaide Hills Council local government area.


== History ==
The name Cudlee Creek is probably derived from the Kaurna word kadli, meaning the Dingo Creek.
The first European inhabitants of Cudlee Creek settled in 1838, when William Kelly, from the Isle of Man, came to the area and established the Sulby Glen estate. A district history states that Sulby Glen was "...well-known for cheese-making. Quite a lot of wheat was grown; fruit trees were planted and a lot of potatoes marketed". It became a significant exporter of apples and pears, and a cold store, built in 1922 for a fruit-growers' cooperative, is the most prominent building in the town.
In 2019, a big bushfire burnt out parts of the town and the areas around it.
