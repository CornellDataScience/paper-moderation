== Geography ==
The geography of the Huntsville-Decatur Metro Area ranges from the tall peaks of the southern Appalachian Mountains, to the low valleys formed by the Tennessee River.  Decatur sits on the southern shore of the Tennessee River, while Huntsville lies about 10 miles from the Tennessee River, and sits at the base of Monte Sano Mountain.

== Infrastructure ==


=== Roadways ===
The heart of the Huntsville–Decatur Metro Area (Huntsville, Decatur, and Madison) is linked together by the 22 mile strip of Interstate 565.
Interstate 565 begins at the eastern edge of the Decatur city limits near the interchange with Interstate 65. At the interchange, Alternate US 72 and State Route 20 become a controlled access highway as it passes under Interstate 65 receiving traffic from the north – (Nashville), and south – (Birmingham / Decatur / Hartselle) in addition to the nearly 40,000-51,000 vehicles per day from Decatur to Huntsville on the Alternate US 72 Corridor.
Plans are underway to extend Interstate 565 from the Interstate 65/Alternate US 72/State Route 20 interchange to the US 31/State Route 20/Alternate US 72 interchange in the Limestone County portion of Decatur. Eventually the extended Interstate Highway will cross the Tennessee River's Wheeler Lake intersecting the once proposed Memphis to Atlanta Highway..


==== Huntsville/Madison roadways ====
As Interstate 565 passes the northern portion of the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, Madison Boulevard (formerly State Route 20) branches off of the interstate leading into Madison. Beyond Madison Boulevard's convergence with Interstate 565 nine miles beyond, Research Park Boulevard, an important north/south expressway connecting Cummings Research Park, MidCity (a mixed used development at the location of the former Madison Square Mall), and Redstone Arsenal, bypasses the portions of Huntsville's busier Memorial Parkway.

Interstate 565 winds past the US Space and Rocket Center and approaches downtown as an elevated freeway. About a .5 miles (0.80 km) after the elevated portion of the interstate begins is the largest interchange in Huntsville. The I-565/Memorial Parkway interchange carries over 150,000 vehicles a day. Memorial Parkway stretches from the Tennessee River to Normal. The Parkway feeds the 7-lane University Drive, also known as US 72. Also intersecting the Parkway is the 5-lane Governors Drive (US 431) that serves southeast Huntsville, Hampton Cove, and Huntsville Hospital. Interstate 565 ascends Chapman Mountain, and descends the other side towards Gurley as US 72.


==== Decatur roadways ====
Decatur's main roadways are 6th Avenue – (U.S. Route 31), and Beltline Road – State Route 67.
6th Avenue, part of U.S. Route 31, begins as both State Route 20/Alternate US 72, and US 31 are carved out of the "Steamboat Bill" Hudson Memorial Bridge that crosses the Tennessee River at the north central part of town. AL 20/Alt US 72 continues west towards The Shoals, after The Beltline begins in the vicinity of the Solutia plant. After the Tennessee River bridges 6th Avenue continues southward where it eventually intersects with The Beltline.  After that intersection, 6th Avenue continues southward now under the name of Decatur Highway towards Hartselle and Birmingham.
The Beltline was built as a western bypass to reduce congestion on 6th Avenue. The area around the Beltline experienced rapid growth, causing additional traffic problems. The city's approach to this was to widen the road to six lanes, which was to be completed by 2010.


== Economy ==
The economy of the Huntsville-Decatur Area has significant technical, aerospace, manufacturing, and defensive components. Huntsville is also home to the second largest research park in the country, Cummings Research Park.
The Huntsville–Decatur Metro Area is the second fastest growing region/metro area in the state of Alabama because of the ample job opportunities being instilled in the area. Both ports in the metro area are two of the busiest in the state. Huntsville International Airport is the second busiest in Alabama, and still growing, trailing Birmingham International Airport in Birmingham. The Port of Decatur, along the Tennessee River, has grown to be the largest/busiest along the Tennessee River.


=== Tennessee Valley Authority ===
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal plan, creating numerous dams, locks, nuclear power plants, coal power plants, along with many others, to create jobs along one of the most poverty ridden regions in the United States. The TVA has turned many tired North Alabama towns into some of the most technologically advanced cities in the country. A high quality of living, has helped to fuel the Huntsville and Decatur area's explosion into the aerospace, bio-technical, and other research market areas of the U.S.
The Tennessee Valley Authority has grown to be the largest public utility provider in the United States.
