== Biography ==
Fenwick was born on 18 March 1632. He was the son of Edward Fenwick of Staunton and his wife Sarah Nevill of Cheat, Yorkshire.
He was Lieutenant-Colonel of Lockhart's New Model Army regiment at the battle of the Dunes fought on 4/14 July 1658. He led Lockhart's regiment in an attack up the 150 feet (46 m) dune (sand-hill) which was defended by veteran Spanish soldiers, and the sides of which were so steep that attacking English had to scramble up on hands and knees. The English after two volleys and push of pike managed to drive the Spanish from the hill and then pursued them down the far side. They were then in turn attacked by cavalry who were unable to break the English formation and were themselves then driven off by French cavalry. All but two of the officers in the regiment that took part in the storming of the sand-hill were killed or wounded with Captain Henry Jones who had volunteered to accompany the regiment into battle taken prisoner.  The performance of the Regiment won the English Army renown throughout Europe. A contemporary newspaper reported that:

Lieutenant-Col. Roger Fenwick, a gentleman of high courage and worth, who led the first forces up the sand-hill against the enemy, and notwithstanding the great advantages the enemies had in that place, did by his valour and gallant example, contribute very much to that great victory, is dead of his wounds, dying at Mardike the very day that the English took possession of Dunkirk, to which place his corpse is to be carried and will be honorably interred in the cathedral of that town.
