Berry Bickle (born 1959) is a Zimbabwean artist who resides in Maputo. Born in Bulawayo, Bickle attended the Chisipite Senior School in Harare. Later, she attended the Durban Institute of Technology, where she obtained a national diploma in fine arts, and South Africa's Rhodes University, where she obtained a master's degree in fine arts. Bickle was a founding member of Bulawayo's Visual Artists' Association.
She divides her time between Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and her work explores the region's history of colonialism. In 1988, she and Tapfuma Gutsa organised the Pachipamwe workshop, the first Triangle Art Trust workshop organised in Africa. In 2010 she became a Rockefeller Foundation Creative Arts Fellow and she works at the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center on the series Suite Europa.


== Work ==
Berry Bickle is a multimedia artist who works in installation, video, photography, and ceramics. Her works are generally installations, and are mixed media works which incorporate script; some include video and photography. Bickle has collaborated closely with the Zimbabwean ceramicist, Marjorie Wallace. She has collaborated with the Peruvian artist Adrian Velasquez.
The exhibition and the publication Inscribing Meaning: Writing and Graphic Systems in African Art highlight the presence of texts in Bickle's work and the importance of the act of writing and of collecting words; in this frame, the artist labels her work "Re-Writes".
