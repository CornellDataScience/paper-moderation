== Critical reception ==

With a B grade Robert Christgau of the Village Voice wrote "Earth, Wind & Fire's girl group--literally. Whether it's Jeanette, Sheila, or Wanda who sounds like Diana Ross at a higher level of consciousness, the effect is exquisite." Amy Hanson of Allmusic, in a retrospective 3 out of 5 star review, opined "Revamping their classic girl group soul sounds to incorporate the more eclectic nuances of (Maurice) White's production, the resultant brassed-up disco proved to be on target." She added " With fellow Earth, Wind & Fire members Verdine and Fred White adding their unmistakable chops to the sound, the Emotions ultimately emerged with an absolutely stunning brew that kept their powerful vocal harmonies well spotlighted, while adding more than a little funk to the sound." Jim Arundel of Melody Maker also called Flowers "an incredibly short but definitely sweet album."


== Singles ==
The album's title track got to No.16 on the US Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No.2 on the NZ Top 40 Singles chart. Another single, "I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love", reached No. 4 on the US Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs chart and No.13 on the US Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.
