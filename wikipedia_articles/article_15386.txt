Typhoon Flo, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Norming, was a long-lived typhoon that brought destruction to much of Japan during September 1990. Flo originated from an area of convection that first formed to the southeast of the Marshall Islands on September 7. Five days later, the disturbance obtained tropical depression status, and on September 13, intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking west-northwest as it rounded a subtropical ridge, Flo slowly deepened, and on September 15, became a typhoon. After developing an eye, Flo began to rapidly intensify, and on September 17, Flo attained peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon began to recurve to the northeast towards Honshu in response to deepening troughs to the northwest and north of the system, which resulted in a weakening trend due to increased vertical wind shear despite remaining over warm water. On September 19, Flo made landfall on southern Honshu, becoming the first typhoon to hit the Kii Peninsula in 11 years, and thereafter started to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of Flo were last noted on the morning of September 22.
Typhoon Flo was the strongest system to affect Japan since 1959. For a period of three days, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across much of the Japanese archipelago, which inflicted damage in 44 of 47 prefectures. The typhoon also passed just east of Okinawa, coming close enough to drop heavy rainfall. There, four people were killed, four were hurt, and five vessels sunk. On the northeastern side of Shikoku Island, in Kagawa Prefecture, two people were killed, 1,748 homes were damaged, and another 116 homes were destroyed. Across the Amami Islands, 13 people were killed, 29 others were hurt, 917 homes were damaged, and an additional 446 houses were destroyed, resulting in 2,327 homeless individuals. In Okayama Prefecture on the main Japanese island of Honshu, ten people perished and nine others were injured. There, 2,810 homes were demolished, 4,675 others were damaged, and Flo was the worst typhoon to strike the prefecture since 1964. While damage in Tokyo was slight, 260,000 passengers were stranded after 117 trains along the Tōkaidō Shinkansen line were disrupted. Due to a prolonged period of heavy rain, partially caused by Flo, rainfall was 300% of normal in some locations on the island as of mid-September 1990 while sunshine time was a mere 64% of average in Hokkaido Prefecture. Overall, 40 fatalities were reported and 131 others sustained injuries. A total 16,541 houses were destroyed while 18,183 others were flooded. Additionally, 413 ships sunk and 10,365 acres (4,195 ha) of farmland were damaged. The typhoon flooded or cut roads at 418 locations and railroads at 31 spots while there were also greater than 450 landslides. A total of 337 flights were canceled by Japan's four major airlines (Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Japan Air System, and Air Nippon) affecting around 33,000 passengers. Moreover, 245 trains were halted, leaving almost 300,000 stranded. Monetary damage amounted to ¥132 billion or US$918 million across the country.


== Meteorological history ==

The origins of Typhoon Flo can be traced to an area of convection that first formed to the southeast of the Marshall Islands on September 7. At 06:00 UTC the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system while it was located about 430 km (270 mi) east-southeast of Guam. Initially, the disturbance tracked generally west-northwest as it remained weak. Over the next four days, the storm's convective structure slowly improved caused by an expansion of its equatorial outflow channel while also turning westward - on a course typical of a straight runner. On September 12, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Following the disturbance's development of a well-defined upper-level center and an additional increase in organization, aided by the subtropical jet the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 05:30 UTC that day. At 18:00 UTC on September 12, the JTWC declared the system a tropical depression. Six hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression into a tropical storm, with the JTWC followed suit based on Dvorak classifications of T2.5/65 km/h (40 mph).
Around this time, Flo began to track west-northwest at a pace of 23 km/h (14 mph) under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north. Flo initially intensified at the climatological rate of one T number per day, and at 06:00 UTC on September 14, the JMA upgraded Flo to a severe tropical storm. Early the following day, both agencies classified Flo as a typhoon, although operationally the JTWC did not upgrade Flo into a typhoon until 06:00 UTC, when the storm developed a small but circular eye. After becoming a typhoon, Flo began to rapidly intensify. Over the ensuing 36 hours, the JTWC estimated that Flo deepened by 130 km/h (80 mph). Midday on September 16, the JTWC upgraded Flo into a super typhoon, which is defined by the JTWC as a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 240 km/h (150 mph), although satellite intensity estimates suggested that Flo was even stronger. At 06:00 UTC on September 17, the JTWC raised the intensity of the typhoon to 265 km/h (165 mph), equal to Category 5 status on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS); the basis for this was flight level observations from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Shortly thereafter, a dropsonde from the aircraft measured a barometric pressure of 891 mbar (26.3 inHg). Around this time, the JMA estimated the typhoon peaked in intensity, with winds of 225 km/h (140 mph) and a pressure of 890 mbar (26 inHg).
Around the time Flo peaked in intensity, the typhoon began to recurve to the northeast in response to a deepening mid-latitude shortwave trough to the northwest, which induced a break in the subtropical ridge. At 00:00 UTC on September 18, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon weakened back to a tropical storm. Weakening continued due to increased vertical wind shear, although the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current helped Flo maintain some of its intensity. Typhoon Flo accelerated northeastward towards Honshu in response to a trough passing north of the system. Around 06:00 UTC on September 19, the storm made landfall on southern Honshu, with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of 170 km/h (105 mph) and 160 km/h (100 mph) respectively at the time of landfall. After passing over Japan, Flo began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. At 00:00 UTC on September 20, the JMA declared Flo extratropical, while the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm. Six hours later, the JTWC issued their last warning on the system because it had completed its extratropical transition. The extratropical remnants of Flo were last noted on the morning of September 22.


== Preparations ==

On September 17, 57 fights from Japan Airlines, Japan Air System, and All Nippon Airways to and from Naha were called off, stranding 57,000 passengers. Ferry service to and from Okinawa was halted and 403 schools were closed there that day. While preparing for the storm, two injures occurred in Tagajō. Flood warnings were issued on September 19 for Tokyo, Yokohama, and Chiba. Storm surge warnings were issued for the coastal areas of Yamanashi Prefecture.
