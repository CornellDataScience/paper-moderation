In the context of the physical and mathematical theory of percolation, a percolation transition is characterized by a set of universal critical exponents, which describe the fractal properties of the percolating medium at large scales and sufficiently close to the transition. The exponents are universal in the sense that they only depend on the type of percolation model and on the space dimension. They are expected to not depend on microscopic details such as the lattice structure, or whether site or bond percolation is considered. This article deals with the critical exponents of random percolation.
Percolating systems have a parameter 
  
    
      
        p
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\,\!}
  
 which controls the occupancy of sites or bonds in the system. At a critical value 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            c
          
        
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{c}\,\!}
  
, the mean cluster size goes to infinity and the percolation transition takes place. As one approaches 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            c
          
        
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{c}\,\!}
  
, various quantities either diverge or go to a constant value by a power law in 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        p
        −
        
          p
          
            c
          
        
        
          |
        
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |p-p_{c}|\,\!}
  
, and the exponent of that power law is the critical exponent. While the exponent of that power law is generally the same on both sides of the threshold, the coefficient or "amplitude" is generally different, leading to a universal amplitude ratio.


== Description ==
Thermodynamic or configurational systems near a critical point or a continuous phase transition become fractal, and the behavior of many quantities in such circumstances is described by universal critical exponents. Percolation theory is a particularly simple and fundamental model in statistical mechanics which has a critical point, and a great deal of work has been done in finding its critical exponents, both theoretically (limited to two dimensions) and numerically.
Critical exponents exist for a variety of observables, but most of them are linked to each other by exponent (or scaling) relations. Only a few of them are independent, and the choice of the fundamental exponents depends on the focus of the study at hand. One choice is the set 
  
    
      
        {
        σ
        ,
        
        τ
        }
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\sigma ,\,\tau \}\,\!}
  
 motivated by the cluster size distribution, another choice is 
  
    
      
        {
        
          d
          
            f
          
        
        ,
        
        ν
        }
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{d_{\text{f}},\,\nu \}\,\!}
  
 motivated by the structure of the infinite cluster. So-called correction exponents extend these sets, they refer to higher orders of the asymptotic expansion around the critical point.

. The chemical distance can also be thought of as a time in an epidemic growth process, and one also defines

, and 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  
 is the dynamical exponent. One also writes

    {\displaystyle \nu _{\parallel }=\nu _{t}}
  
.
Also related to the minimum dimension is the simultaneous growth of two nearby clusters. The probability that the two clusters coalesce exactly in time

. The infinite cluster becomes homogeneous at length scales beyond the correlation length; further, it is a measure for the linear extent of the largest finite cluster. Other notation: Thermal exponent

== Exponents for standard percolation on a non-trivial planar lattice (Weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)) ==

Note that it has been claimed that the numerical values of exponents of percolation depend only on the dimension of lattice. However, percolation on WPSL is an exception in the sense that albeit it is two dimensional yet it does not belong to the same universality where all the planar lattices belong.


== Exponents for directed percolation ==
Directed percolation (DP) refers to percolation in which the fluid can flow only in one direction along bonds—such as only in the downward direction on a square lattice rotated by 45 degrees. This system is referred to as "1 + 1 dimensional DP" where the two dimensions are thought of as space and time.
