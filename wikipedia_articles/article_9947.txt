=== Managerial and coaching turnover ===
After 3+1⁄2 seasons at the helm of the Braves and compiling a record of 341–231 (.596) with two NL pennants and the 1957 World Series championship, manager Fred Haney, 63, resigned on October 4 in the wake of the 1959 tie-breaker series loss to the L.A. Dodgers. On October 24, the Braves appointed another veteran skipper, Chuck Dressen, 65, well known as the manager of the "Boys of Summer" Brooklyn Dodgers of 1951–1953, as Haney's successor for 1960. The Braves had considered a number of high-profile former big-league managers, as well as minor league skipper Ben Geraghty, before settling on Dressen.
Pitching coach Whit Wyatt was Dressen's only 1960 holdover from Haney's coaching staff, with Billy Herman, John Fitzpatrick and George Susce all departing with Haney.
