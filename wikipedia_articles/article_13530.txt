Fernando González Gortázar (19 October 1942 – 7 October 2022) was a Mexican architect, sculptor, and writer, considered to be one of the most influential Mexican architects of the 20th century.


== Life and career ==
Fernando González Gortázar was born in Mexico City on 19 October 1942. He grew up and spent his youth in Guadalajara, Jalisco, but would later return to his birthplace of Mexico City, from 1990. He studied architecture at the University of Guadalajara (Mexico) and received his BA in 1966, presenting as his thesis the project for a National Monument to Independence. As a student, he participated in several sculpture workshops with Professor Olivier Seguin at the School of Fine Arts of the same university.
González Gortázar studied Esthetics with Pierre Francastel at the Superior School of Art and Archeology (now the Institute of Art and Archeology), and the Sociology of Art with Jean Cassou at the Collège de France, both in Paris (1967-1968). An architect, urbanist, landscape artist, scholar of Mexican folklore, he fought for the preservation of the historical-cultural and ecological-natural heritage of Mexico.
Among his most important works, we find The Great Gate (1969), the Fountain of Sister Water (1970), the entrance to González Gallo Park and The Tower of Cubes (both from 1972), the Plaza-Fountain (1973), the González Silva House (1980), the Elf’s Walkway (1991), the Maya People’s Museum (1993), the Public Safety Center (1993), the Los Altos University Center of the University of Guadalajara (1993, still unfinished), the Chiapas Museum of Science and Technology (2005), and the Emblem of San Pedro (Fátima and the Flags Monument, 2011), and The Three Hairs of the Devil (2014), all in various cities in Mexico, as well as the Fountain of Stairs (Madrid, 1987) and The Escorial Tree (El Escorial, 1995) in Spain, and the Disjointed Column (1989) at the Hakone Open-Air Museum, in Japan.
In 2000, he held the Federico Mariscal Professorship of the Department of Architecture of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). In 2009, he hosted Cancioncitas (Little Songs), 26 radio programs on Mexican popular music in the twentieth century, for Radio UNAM, which were later rebroadcast by several stations in Mexico and Colombia.
González Gortázar died on 7 October 2022, at the age of 79.
