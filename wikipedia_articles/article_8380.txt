The 2027 Cricket World Cup qualification is an ongoing process by which teams will qualify for the 2027 Cricket World Cup. A series of competitions will determine which teams will take part in the tournament.


== Format ==

The eight top-ranked teams in the ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings, along with the 2027 hosts will automatically qualify for the tournament. The CWC Challenge League Play-off served as a relegation tournament allowing new teams from the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings to enter the qualification cycle. 13th to 28th placed teams from the previous cycle along with the 4 teams advanced from the Challenge League Play-off entered the 20-team qualification cycle to compete for the remaining 4 spots in the World Cup.
The next two teams in the ODI rankings (excluding the teams already qualified) will directly qualify for the CWC Qualifier. The remaining 20 sides are divided into two leagues, the CWC League 2 (8 teams) and the CWC Challenge League (12 teams). Based on the results of the leagues, teams will either directly qualify for the CWC Qualifier, be eliminated from the World Cup qualification, or advance to the CWC Qualifier Play-off through which they could qualify for the CWC Qualifier. The Qualifier Play-off will also determine promotion and relegation between the two leagues.
