=== Jiaqing era ===
The future Consort Xiang was born on the 13th day of the first lunar month in the 13th year of the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor, which translates to 9 February 1808 in the Gregorian calendar.


=== Daoguang era ===
In 1821, Lady Niohuru entered the Forbidden City and was granted the title "Noble Lady Xiang" by the Daoguang Emperor. On 26 December 1823, she was elevated to "Concubine Xiang". On 2 March 1825, she gave birth to the emperor's second daughter, who would die prematurely on 27 August 1825.
On 30 May 1825, Lady Niohuru was elevated to "Consort Xiang". She gave birth on 15 November 1829 to the emperor's fifth daughter, Princess Shouzang of the Second Rank, and on 23 July 1831 to his fifth son, Yicong.
Even though Lady Niohuru and the Daoguang Emperor had three children, the emperor did not seem to favour her. In 1837, he demoted her to "Noble Lady Xiang" for reasons unknown. Lady Niohuru's father, Jiufu, was found guilty of corruption just before her demotion, but official records did not seem to point out any connection between her father's indictment and her demotion.


=== Xianfeng era ===
The Daoguang Emperor died on 26 February 1850 and was succeeded by his fourth son Yizhu, who was enthroned as the Xianfeng Emperor. The Xianfeng Emperor elevated Lady Niohuru to "Dowager Concubine Xiang". She died on 15 February 1861 and was interred in the Mu Mausoleum of the Western Qing tombs.
