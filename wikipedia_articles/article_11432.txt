Park Hills is a city in St. Francois County, Missouri, United States. The population was 8,587 at the 2020 census.


== History ==
The city was formed in an unusual four-way merger that took place in January 1994, in which the cities of Flat River, Elvins, Esther and the village of Rivermines joined to form the new city of Park Hills.  The formerly incorporated village of Fairview Acres had previously merged with Flat River on November 8, 1983. The name of the new city was selected by entries submitted to a committee made up of citizens of the four cities. The name Park Hills was submitted by Mildred Lee, a lifelong resident and a former teacher of Flat River. The inspiration came from its hilly terrain in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains and the many parks that surround the area. Park Hills is located 7 miles northwest of Farmington, Missouri and approximately 65 miles south of St. Louis. It is adjacent to St. Joe State Park, and nearby the state parks of St. Francois, Hawn, Elephant Rocks, Johnson's Shut-Ins, Taum Sauk Mountain, and Washington.
Park Hills is home to Mineral Area College, formerly known as Flat River Junior College. The town is located in the Old Lead Belt, formerly a large lead mining district.
The Eugene Field School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.
