=== The city of Fredericia ===

The city of Fredericia was founded in 1650 by Frederik III, after whom it was named.  Fredericia was almost selected as the Danish capital, due to its central location and large port; but the costs from building the necessary government buildings and building a palace for the royal family, grew too big so the plans were scrapped and Copenhagen remained the capital.
The city is one of Denmark's largest traffic hubs, and is home to the army's Signals Regiment (Telegrafregimentet), which is located at Ryes Barracks (Ryes Kaserne) and Bülows Barracks (Bülows Kaserne).
