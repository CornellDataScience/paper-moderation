The women's singles tournament got off to an auspicious start with the third, fourth, and fifth seeds all losing in the first round. The quarterfinals featured six unseeded players, two of which - Duke's Kelly Chen and North Carolina's Cameron Morra (only a freshman at the time) - reached the semifinals. Three of the four semifinalists represented ACC schools.
Estela Pérez-Somarriba of Miami, the nation's top-ranked player entering the tournament, dropped only two sets (including the first set in the championship) en route to winning the title. She became the second Miami woman to be crowned national champion, after Audra Cohen in 2007. Finalist Katarina Jokic was the fifth woman from Georgia to reach the NCAA final and first since 2010.
