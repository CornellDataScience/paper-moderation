Turnbull School is a full-time private, non-denominational school for students in Junior Kindergarten to grade 8 located in the Carlington neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.


== History ==
Turnbull School was founded in 1992 by Mary Ann S. Turnbull, M.Ed., and moved to its present location on former Central Experimental Farm/National Capital Commission land in 1996, the property being 5Â½ acres. The initial building included two levels of classrooms, two computer labs, a library, offices, a gym. The school was founded following on the success of the Turnbull Learning Centre (previously the "part-time academic assistance" branch of the school) which was established in 1981 and which offered academic services to the wider community until 2010. The school underwent a major expansion, completed in 2003, that saw the addition of a state-of-the-art computer lab and science lab (both equipped with SmartBoard technology), new grade 7 and 8 classrooms, a double gymnasium with a fold-down stage, a visual arts room, music studio, and common areas.
