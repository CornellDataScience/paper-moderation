Herbert Arthur Hodges (4 January 1905 – 2 July 1976) was a British philosopher and theologian. He was Professor of Philosophy at Reading University from 1934 to 1969.
He was a member of The Moot, the discussion and study group begun by J. H. Oldham. Its purpose was "to continue, in an informal, confidential but serious way, exploration of the relation between church and society and the realisation of Christian ethics in the public sphere." Other members included T. S. Eliot, with whom Hodges corresponded. Eliot suggested to Karl Mannheim that Hodges was closer to Mannheim than others in the Moot, in at least some areas of thought.
Hodges represented the Church of England at the first assembly of the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam in Aug-Sept 1948.
Hodges published books on Wilhelm Dilthey, on Welsh hymnody and on Christianity.
