The 2021 Australian Swimming Championships were held from 14 to 18 April 2021 at the Gold Coast Aquatic Centre in Gold Coast, Queensland.
Following Australia's performance at the 2016 Rio Olympics where 29 medals were won and finishing 10th on the medal tally, Swimming Australia announced in the February 2017 that the timing of the selection trials would be modified. Historically, the trials were held in April several months before the Olympics were held. This will be now changed to follow the American model where the trials are held six weeks before. The 2021 Australian Swimming Trials were then held at the South Australia Aquatic and Leisure Centre from 12 to 17 June and will be selection trials for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
With the 2020 Australian Championships cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Swimming Australia released the 2021 swimming competition calendar in July 2020. In September 2020, it was announced that Gold Coast would be hosting the event. This meet followed the structure of the Olympic program with heats in the evenings and finals in the morning. This follows the prescient set at the 2008 Beijing Olympics where broadcaster NBC demanded this change so that the finals will be shown on primetime in the United States.
The event was held in a 10-lane pool with 10 lanes being used. This meant that two non-Australian swimmers could progress through the final. With the exception of the distance events, the heats were swum in reverse order with the fastest seeded heat first. Three finals for each event were held – men's 18–19 years, men's 21–21 years, women's 17–18 years, women's 19–20 years and men's and women's open.
There were no major withdrawals from the event with the exception of 2016 Olympian Georgia Bohl who pulled out due to a knee injury. During the Day 2 heats session, Mitch Larkin was disqualified in the heats of the 100 metre backstroke for a false start. Kyle Chalmers won the 50, 100 and 200 metre freestyle events, defending  his titles from 2019. By taking out the 50 metre butterfly event, Holly Barratt at the age of 33 became the oldest female Australian champion eclipsing the silver medallist from the 1912 Olympics Mina Wylie. Singer, songwriter Cody Simpson made his return to competitive swimming, reaching the final of the 50 metre butterfly event.
