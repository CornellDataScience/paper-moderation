Jacob Westervelt (1794–1881) is often confused with his brother-in-law John Jacob V.B. Westervelt (1805–1866), who was a Deputy Sheriff under him, and subsequently High Sheriff of New York City himself too (1846–1849), as well as Assistant Alderman from the 16th Ward (1844–1846). Another namesake is Jacob Aaron Westervelt (1800–1879), the shipbuilder, Alderman from the 13th Ward and later Mayor of New York City (1853–1855).
A Sheriff, Jacob Westervelt was involved in the New York City Police Riot of 1857, known then as the Great Police Riot. It was a conflict which occurred between the New York Municipal and Metropolitan Police on June 16, 1857. Arising over Mayor Fernando Wood's appointment of Charles Devlin over Daniel Conover for the position of city street commissioner, amid rumors that Devlin purchased the office for $50,000 from Wood himself, Municipal police battled Metropolitan officers attempting to arrest Mayor Wood. During the battle, Conover and his attorney visited Sheriff Jacob Westervelt to request that he serve the warrants. Westervelt was advised by his own representatives, who agreed that it was his legal responsibility to do so. He left with the two men for City Hall. Upon his arrival, Wood again refused to leave his office.
Jay Westervelt (Jacob James Westervelt), a contemporary 21st century New York biologist/professional snowboarder, is a namesake descendant of Jacob Westervelt.
