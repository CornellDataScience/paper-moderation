Cove is a city in Union County, Oregon, United States. The population was 620 at the 2020 census.


== History ==
This area was well known to the Cayuse and Nez Perce Tribes who referred to it as Wiweeletitpe (wee-walla-tit-puh), meaning "Many creeks flowing at that place". Euro-Americans first settled here in 1862, and in 1863 they established a post office named Forest Cove. Samuel G. French was the first postmaster. To avoid confusion between Forest Cove and another Oregon community, Forest Grove in Washington County, post office authorities changed the name to Cove in 1868. Cove was platted in the 1870s along Ruckles Road, only the second road over the Blue Mountains.
