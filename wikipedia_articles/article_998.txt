Sveriges 12:a (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈsvæ̌rjɛs ˈtɔ̂lːva]; "Sweden's twelve [points]") was a one-off music competition in the Eurovision format, organised and broadcast by the Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT). It served as an alternative for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020, which was planned to be held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The competition consisted of a pre-qualifying round on 9 May 2020, hosted by Christer Björkman and David Sundin, and a final on 14 May 2020, hosted by Christer Björkman and Sarah Dawn Finer. Both shows were broadcast live on SVT1, as well as on the streaming platform SVT Play.


== Format ==
During the pre-qualifying round on 9 May 2020, short clips of all forty-one entries that would have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 were shown, including the Swedish entry "Move" by the Mamas, despite not being a part of the programme's competitive element. From the remaining forty entries, televoting determined which twenty-five songs would be heard in full during the final on 14 May 2020. Only the Swedish public was able to vote and could do so via the Melodifestivalen app. In the final, which also featured a live performance of "Move" and a new song, "Let It Be", by the Mamas, it was determined which entry would have received Sweden's twelve points, had the Eurovision Song Contest not been cancelled.


=== Presenters ===

The pre-qualifying round was hosted by two presenters: comedian David Sundin, who also co-hosted Melodifestivalen 2020, and singer and television producer Christer Björkman, who represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 1992. The final was hosted by Björkman and singer and television presenter Sarah Dawn Finer, who also co-hosted Melodifestivalen in 2012, 2016 and 2019.
