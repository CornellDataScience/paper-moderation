42:40 -:- At the 12:40 mark of the third period with the teams tied at 3–3, Estonia broke in 2-on-1 on the Canadian goal. Maksim Vedernikov rushed down the left side and centered a pass for teammate Kaido Kalm, but Kalm collided with a Canadian defender and the puck appeared to deflect into the net before the net was dislodged. After attending to injured Canadian goalie Paul Rosen, referee Morten Marthinsen never signaled a goal, and after a brief delay ordered a faceoff in the Canadian zone. Replays clearly showed the goal should have counted. The following statement was prepared by Alf Inge Andersen, International Paralympic Committee referee-in-chief for the ice sledge hockey tournament: "The referee (Morten Marthisen), situated near the right faceoff circle (to the goalie's left) did not see the puck cross the goal line. His view was obstructed by players. Neither linesman (Gary Cutler and Bob McMann) could see the puck cross the goal line. The referee declared a no-goal situation.  Unlike International Ice Hockey Federation rules used in the Olympic hockey tournament, video replay is not approved for use in the Paralympic ice sledge hockey tournament."
