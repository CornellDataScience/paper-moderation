== Reception ==
The Times of India noted the film's viewpoint shifting back and forth through time with the elderly Prasanna persona reflecting upon and reliving and reviving memories of his past and that, even with the character names being different from those of the real life personages being shown, the viewer has no doubt about whom the film is about.  They concluded, "Dusari Goshta excels in every department, be it Chandrakant's direction, Vikram-Sandeep-Siddharth's acting, the cinematography or art direction. It takes you through the political journey of many prominent politicians and events that change the course of India's political history."


== Soundtrack ==
Giving it three stars, the Times of India praised the film's music, writing "The soundtrack of Dusari Goshta boasts of soulful melody and lyrics with deep meaning. With just two tracks, Dusari Goshta is an album for keeps."

Khelnare haat pai, sung by Shankar Mahadevan, with Vidit Patankar and Pallavi Aandev on backup vocals.
Mani achanak hal le kahi, sung by Mangesh Dhakde and Kirti Killedar
The Times of India wrote "Both songs are unique in their own way. While Khelnare... has Shankar dominating the track with his sombre vocals, the duet ballad 'Mani achanak....' is a soft number that is easy on the ears."
