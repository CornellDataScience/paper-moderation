== Profile ==
The Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad is situated in the north of the province of Punjab and is a modern and well-equipped stadium. But no matter how impressive a venue is, not much can be done about the weather and Faisalabad has suffered at the hands of the elements. In 1998–99 fog caused the third Test against Zimbabwe was abandoned without a ball being bowled, while bad light is often an issue especially for matches played during the winter. However, when play has been possible, some memorable performances have taken place. An exciting Test was played out in 1997–98 when South Africa skittles Pakistan for 92, successfully defending a target of 142 on the final day. Then, in 2004–05, Sanath Jayasuriya smashed 253 as Sri Lanka powered to a 201-run victory. But the ground is most famous for the confrontation between Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana during England's 1987–88 tour, which led to a day being lost during the match and some long-lasting bad feeling between the teams. The Pakistan Cricket Board also conducts its domestic tournaments at this venue. Recently, Super 8 T20 was held here from 11 to 18 May. The stadium itself is only 2 km out of the city centre, which can be reached by a walk through the tree-lined suburbs.
In 2016, 4 new cricket pitches were added to take the total cricket pitches to 9 now.
