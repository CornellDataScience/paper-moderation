== Plot ==
Dr. Ichito Kurihara (Sho Sakurai) works at a clinic in Nagano Prefecture. He rarely has any free time due to the clinic's shortage of doctors and the constant influx of patients. He even sometimes diagnoses patients out of his area of specialty and sometimes goes days without sleeping. He hopes to work at a major hospital where he can get more free time to spend with his wife, Haruna (Aoi Miyazaki), and to specialize in his field of study. However, he is also reluctant to add to shortage of doctors at the clinic and break his relationships with the patients.
One day, he clears out the belongings of a terminal cancer patient who died and discovers a letter written to him thanking him for the care he provided to her, even though he could not cure her sickness. He then has a revelation about the medical chart he keeps in his hand - filled with personal observations and concerns.
