Feit is genderqueer. As a musician, they have recorded several albums both solo and with the groups Darshan and The Epichorus.

== Early life ==
Feit was raised in Manhattan by a secular Jewish family. They attended the Abraham Joshua Heschel School beginning in third grade when their mother got a job there. Their family were members of the B'nai Jeshurun synagogue. As a child, Feit took piano and guitar lessons and taught himself music, including transcription and composition. In high school, they were influenced musically by Nirvana's Kurt Cobain.
After graduating high school, Feit worked in photography, graphic and web design. They started becoming more religious in their early 20s, influenced by Sefer Yetzirah and the works of Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, the founder of the Jewish Renewal movement.
Feit moved to Jerusalem's Nachlaot neighborhood in 2005 to study in yeshiva. There, Feit and their friends created an informal band called Lev Yerushalayim, with whom they would beatbox and freestyle rap at late-night concerts outside Yeshivat Simchat Shlomo.
