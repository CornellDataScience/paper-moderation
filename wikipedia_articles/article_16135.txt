The Hailu dialect (simplified Chinese: 海陆腔; traditional Chinese: 海陸腔; pinyin: Hǎilù qiāng; Hailu Hakka Romanization System: hoi´ liug` kiong`), also known as the Hoiluk dialect or Hailu Hakka (simplified Chinese: 海陆客语; traditional Chinese: 海陸客語; pinyin: Hǎilù Kèyǔ), is a dialect of Hakka Chinese that originated in Shanwei, Guangdong. It is also the second most common dialect of Hakka spoken in Taiwan.


== Classification ==
The first edition of the Language Atlas of China places the Hakka dialects spoken in Haifeng and Lufeng into the Xin–Hui cluster (新惠小片; Xīn-Huì xiǎopiàn) of the Yue–Tai subgroup (粤台片; 粵臺片; Yuè-Tái piàn) of Hakka. In the second edition, it is given its own subgroup known as the Hai–Lu subgroup (海陆片; 海陸片; Hǎi-Lù piàn) separate from the Yue–Tai subgroup.
Chang Song-hing and Zhuang Chusheng propose that it should be grouped as the Hai–Lu cluster (海陆小片; 海陸小片; Hǎi-Lù xiǎopiàn) of the Mei–Shao subgroup (梅韶片; Méi-Sháo piàn).
