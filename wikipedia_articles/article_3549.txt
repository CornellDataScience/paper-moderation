Bulb Records is a Michigan-based record label that was formed in 1993 by Peter Larson (now of the two-piece metal rock band 25 Suaves), and James Magas (now known simply as Magas).
The label had originally started putting out records by local Michigan avant-garde musical acts, but had later added extended its roster to nationally and internationally known artists.

Bulb Records' first release was actually catalog number BLB-026. Larson and Magas chose this number to make it appear as though they had more records out at the time. This has resulted in many gaps in the Bulb catalog, and much confusion over release dates.
