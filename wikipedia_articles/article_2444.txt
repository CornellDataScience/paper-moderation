Captain's Curse was a monster truck created by Monster Jam and FELD Motorsports, and competed in the Monster Jam series from 2007 through 2016.
Captain's Curse was first seen in 2007 driven by Pablo Huffaker at Monster Jam World Finals 8. Alex Blackwell then drove the truck for the next five years until moving to Wolverine in 2012.
Styled after a 1941 Willys pickup, the truck originally featured a red-and-black pirate-themed paint scheme. Designed to replace the Blacksmith monster truck, the truck's debut at World Finals 8 was an immediate success, with driver Pablo Huffaker winning his first Monster Jam World Finals freestyle championship behind the wheel of Captain's Curse. Alex Blackwell later took over as driver of the truck with a different chassis, experiencing similar success. At World Finals X, the truck reached the final round in racing against Maximum Destruction. However, the truck lost its brakes during the run, causing the truck to flip violently when Blackwell attempted to steer it. The truck eventually landed several rows in the stands of Sam Boyd Stadium, although no one was injured. After that incident, the truck got a brand new PEI chassis, debuting at Old Bridge Township RACEWAY PARK on May 30, 2009. Ever since then, the truck and driver combo has bought consistent success. In 2012, the truck was temporarily retired, as driver Alex Blackwell was assigned to drive the new version of Wolverine. The truck made a return at the Advance Auto Parts MONSTER JAM World Finals 13 in March 2012, with its original driver Pablo Huffaker behind the wheel. In the 2013 season, Captain's Curse debuted a new black paint scheme, with Blackwell returning behind the wheel. In 2016, a successor named Pirate's Curse debuted, however, the two trucks competed alongside each other for the beginning of the year, with Blackwell eventually moving to Megalodon. Captain’s Curse has since been retired from competition.
