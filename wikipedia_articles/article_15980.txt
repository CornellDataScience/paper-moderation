Sent Into Space is an English aerospace company that launches experimental payloads to near space using weather balloons, for research, aerospace testing, marketing or publicity purposes. As the world's first "aerospace creative agency", Sent Into Space has launched more than 1,000 flights into the upper stratosphere since its formation in 2011.


== History ==
The company was founded in 2011 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, by Chris Rose and Alex Baker. The two met at the University of Sheffield, where they were pursuing doctorates in mechanical engineering. The two were having a conversation at a pub when they thought it would be interesting to attach a camera to a weather balloon that was launched up to space. After six months of experimenting, they launched the balloon on 17 December 2010, from Rose's backyard. They uploaded a video of their process and photos the camera took to YouTube, which went viral. Many companies and individuals saw this video and requested for the duo to launch their own items to space, and they started a company offering balloon launches as a professional service.


== Services ==
Sent Into Space has been used for publicity stunts, cinematography, scientific research, aerospace research, and education. It has been certified by the Civil Aviation Authority. The company also provides its services to scientists desiring to research the atmosphere. In one mission, the craft designed to take samples of atmospheric particles discovered the presence of biological matter — a diatom — much higher than previously believed possible.
The company uses balloons made from biodegradable, undyed latex. They also use hydrogen as a lifting gas instead of helium as it is a renewable resource. The balloons reach 38 km (24 mi) on average, taking a few hours to reach that height. The air pressure this high causes the balloon to keep expanding, reaching 10 m (33 ft) from an original 2 m (6.6 ft) until it bursts. Then, a parachute is deployed and the craft takes about an hour to reach the ground. Sent Into Space has a software that predicts where it will land.


=== Scattering of cremated remains in space ===
Aura Flights, formerly Ascension Flights, is an offshoot of the company exclusively for scattering ashes in the atmosphere. It was launched in 2017 after the technology was first developed in 2015. It appeared on the television programme Dragons' Den, but rejected an offer from Deborah Meaden.
