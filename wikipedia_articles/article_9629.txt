The 2014–15 network television schedule for the five major English-language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers prime time hours from September 2014 to August 2015. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 2013–14 season.
NBC was the first to announce its fall schedule on May 11, 2014, followed by Fox on May 12, 2014, ABC on May 13, 2014, CBS on May 14, 2014 and The CW on May 15, 2014.
PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Ion Television and MyNetworkTV are also not included since the majority of both networks' schedules comprise syndicated reruns (with limited original programming on the latter). The CW is not included on weekends, since it does not offer network programming.
New series are highlighted in bold.
All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific time (except for some live events or specials). Subtract one hour for Central and Mountain times.
Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.
