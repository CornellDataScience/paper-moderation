It was released on October 11, 2011 for the Nintendo Wii in North America and on November 25, 2011 in Europe. Dance Dance Revolution II is the direct sequel to Dance Dance Revolution for the Wii. This game shares songs with the arcade version of Dance Dance Revolution X3 vs 2ndMix. It features characters from the arcade versions of Dance Dance Revolution. It was the final DDR game release for the Nintendo Wii and is the latest in the series to be released for a home console as of 2024.


== Gameplay ==


=== Double Mode ===
Double Mode, which was unavailable in previous Wii games, is now available. While playing in Double Mode, the player can only play the full version of licenses and shortened versions for Konami Original. There is no way to play shortened licenses or the full version of Konami Original.


=== Challenge Difficulty ===
In addition to the four main difficulties, the game now includes Challenge difficulty, similar to the arcade versions. However, because the special shock arrow (which takes the Challenge difficulty space) are not featured in this game, Challenge charts that originally feature shock arrows in the arcade version are excluded (e.g. smooooch・∀・).


=== Difficulty Scale Changes ===
Instead of the traditional ten-foot scale used by previous Wii games, the game now uses the 20-foot difficulty scale first introduced in DDR X. The highest ranked difficulty is the Challenge charts of Valkyrie dimension (in both Single and Double) and the Double-Challenge of POSSESSION, both of which are rated 19 and first introduced in the arcade version of DDR X2.


=== Full Songs ===
For the first time in the series since Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix, players of Dance Dance Revolution II will be able to play long versions of songs. Full versions are only available for licenses and some Konami Original.


=== Multiplayer ===
Standard two-player multiplayer will return with the use of dance pads, and the game will support up to four players.


=== Replicant-D Action ===
"Replicant-D Action", which previously only available on the arcade version of DDR X2 will be available in this game.  There are now 11 songs inside the folder (the previous seven from DDR X2, two songs from DDR Universe 3, and two new boss songs). Conditions for accessing the folder are now much easier.


== Interface and graphics ==
The song list still kept the same Cover Flow interface first introduced in DDR Hottest Party 3 which features the usual Groove Radar and multi-layered difficulty table. The interface dominantly features light blue color scheme with slant patterns and circles. Parts of the interface were reused in the arcade version of DDR X3 vs 2ndMix.


=== Characters ===
Most of the characters are taken from the arcade version of DDR instead of the usual cast from the previous Wii games. The models used are from the arcade version of DDR X2.
