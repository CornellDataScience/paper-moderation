== Arthur Ebeling ==
Arthur H. Ebeling (1882-1965) was a prominent Davenport architect in the first half of the 20th century. He was born in neighboring Rock Island, Illinois. The family moved to Davenport when he was a boy and he was educated in the local public schools where he graduated with honors. He learned the architectural craft from his seven-year apprenticeship with Gustav Hanssen and Dietrich Harfst in Davenport. He then left for Chicago where he studied architecture and engineering. Ebeling returned to Davenport in 1908 and began his own architectural practice. He married Bridget "Belle" McCarthy (1878-1968) and together they had four children Arthur, Paul, Mary Alice, and Patricia.
