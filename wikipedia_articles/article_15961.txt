Northern NSW Football (NNSWF) is the governing body of soccer in the north of New South Wales, Australia. It is a member of the national governing body, Football Australia. The Federation's roots were go back to the formation of the Northern District British Football Association on 26 June 1887. To fall in line with the global football identity, the federation was re-branded to Northern NSW Football on 25 October 2006.


== Formation ==
The Northern British Football Association was probably formed at a meeting of clubs at the Criterion Hotel, Newcastle on Sunday 26 June, 1887. (Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners' Advocate (NSW : 1876 - 1954) Tue 28 Jun 1887, Page 8) 
The clubs which formed the association were Minmi Rangers(1886), Hamilton Athletic(1886), Greta Blue Bells(1887), Carrington Black Watch(1887), Wallsend Rovers(1887), Glebe Black Watch(1887 - Renamed Burwood United)
The Northern British Football Association was part NSW Football Association.
In 1958, many Sydney clubs broke away from the association and formed a new body. Newcastle and Coalfields clubs were not wanted in this new body but would be tolerated. So the Northern clubs decided to run their competition. A  12 team First Division was conducted with: Blacksmith Rangers, West Wallsend, Adamstown, Cessnock, Merewether Advance, Cardiff, Weston, Newcastle Austral, Wallsend, Toronto Awaba, East Lakes, Mayfield United.
This was the beginning of the Northern NSW Soccer Federation.
On 7 May 1980, Northern NSW Soccer Federation Ltd was registered as a company.
On 25 October 2006, the Northern NSW Football was created due to internal restructuring and re-branding.
