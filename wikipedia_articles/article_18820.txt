== History ==
Trenton Catholic Academy's high school, i.e., upper school, was known as McCorristin Catholic High School from 1979 to 2005. From its establishment in September 1962 until 1979, the school was known as Saint Anthony High School and was affiliated with Saint Anthony Church on Olden Avenue in Hamilton Township. The school was renamed to honor McCorristin in 1979 and then renamed as Trenton Catholic Academy in 2005 after a series of mergers with other area schools.
The name McCorristin refers to Monsignor Michael "Iron Mike" McCorristin, a Catholic cleric responsible for major parish expansion projects at Holy Angels Church and Saint Anthony Church in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey (a suburb of Trenton). The announcement of the closing of Trenton Catholic High School at the end of the 1961–62 school year prompted Monsignor McCorristin to build a new high school to serve the parishes of Trenton and Hamilton Township. Monsignor McCorristin was noted for his staunch support of education and parish life as well as a devotion to a spartan personal lifestyle.
In the wake of a $2 million annual deficit and the impact if COVID-19 on enrollment, the Diocese of Trenton announced in January 2021 that the school is scheduled to close at the end of the 2020-2021 academic year. The 550 current TCA students in grades K-12 were to be directed to Notre Dame High School and to other nearby elementary schools as alternatives.
The school later reached an agreement with the archdiocese to become an independent Catholic school under the current name. The new school is operated by a nonprofit known as Trenton Catholic Preparatory Academy, Inc.

The Trenton Catholic Academy Iron Mikes compete in the Burlington County Scholastic League (BCSL), which is comprised of public and private high schools in Burlington, Mercer and Ocean counties in central New Jersey, and operates under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA).

The baseball team won the Non-Public A state championship in 1972 (defeating Don Bosco Preparatory High School), 1974 (vs. Saint Joseph Regional High School) and 1975 (vs. Roselle Catholic High School).

The team was declared as the Non-Public South B sectional champion in 2020 after the group finals were cancelled due to COVID-19. The program's five state championships are tied for tenth-most in the state. The 1983 team finished the season with a 27-3 record after taking a 16-point lead at the half against Union Catholic in the Group II championship game and holding on to win by a score of 65-55.

In doing so, TCA became the first New Jersey high school to capture both a boys (2010) and girls (2011) TOC title.
The boys basketball team won the Non-Public Group A state championship in 1982 (against runner-up Seton Hall Preparatory School in the playoff finals), 1989 (vs. Bergen Catholic High School) and 1990 (vs. Seton Hall), and won the Non-Public B title in 2010 (vs. Saint Anthony High School). The 2010 team won the program's first state title in two decades with a 57–56 win in triple overtime in the Non-Public B championship game at the Ritacco Center against Saint Anthony, a team that had won all 18 of its previous final appearances starting in 1980. Trenton Catholic became the first Mercer County team to win the NJSIAA Tournament of Champions, coming in as the second seed and winning against number-three seed University High School by 63–46 in the semifinals and won vs. top-seeded Camden Catholic High School in the championship game at the Izod Center by a score of 53–39 to finish the season with a 28–3 record.
