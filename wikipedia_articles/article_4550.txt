In anticipation of the 1971 Algerian Cup final, USM Alger had prepared this very important meeting in Palm Beach, in a site reserved for summer camps. The decision was made by then-president Abdelkader Amrani. As for his part, the Mouloudéen neighbor carried out his preparation on the Chiffa side, in a region which allows players to concentrate well.
Victory in the final for the Mouloudéens was priceless. It was a goal for the Greens and Reds to silence their usmist neighbors who teased them for not having won a title despite fifty years of existence. The Mouloudean leaders, like Derriche, Djazouli, Djaout and Balamane, had granted the players the bonus of 100 dinars each, as a consecration.


=== Summary ===
The 9th final in the history of the Algerian Cup brought the two neighbors, MC Alger to USM Alger at the Municipal Stadium (currently Stade 20 Août 1955) into battle. It was the first confrontation between the two teams in the Algerian Cup and the first final for Mouloudia d'Alger in history. On the other side, the Usmists had already taken part in two finals consecutively against CR Bélouizdad in 1969 and 1970. Among the Rouge et Noir, it was already an experienced team with the Allik, Belbekri, Aïssaoui, Saâdi, Meziani and others. On the green and red side, it was the youth with the Kaoua, Betrouni, Zenir, Bachta and many others. The will of the Mouloudéens made the difference against the experience of the Usmistes who lost this final, for the third time in a row.
The Greens and Reds, pushed by a large crowd, started the game with a bang. Barely five minutes past the inevitable Omar Betrouni manages to open the scoring for the benefit of the Mouloudéens and shake the usmist nets. Picked cold, the Red and Black will try to come back to score. They even created a few clear chances to score. But against the course of the game, Zoubir Bachi doubled the score at 36' bringing the Usmists to their knees. In the second half, the Red and Black dominated but the Mouloudéens managed the game until the referee's final whistle.
