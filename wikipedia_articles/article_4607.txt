The North American Vascular Biology Organization (NAVBO) is a scientific society promoting knowledge exchange in the area of vascular biology. The society organizes several international scientific meetings annually which broadly cover the areas of development of blood and lymphatic vasculature, cardiovascular and lymphatic disease, vascular matrix biology and vascular bioengineering.


== History ==
The North American Vascular Biology Organization was founded in 1994 as a non-profit scientific organization with voluntary membership. Since its inception, the organization has welcomed members from various disciplines interested in vascular biology.
The inaugural president was Michael Gimbrone from Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, who served from 1994 to 1995. He was succeeded by Stephen Schwartz from the University of Washington, who held the position from 1995 to 1996 before his death.


== Programs and meetings ==
NAVBO has been instrumental in organizing a series of programs and events designed to foster exchange of knowledge and promote advancements in vascular biology.
The NAVBO Journal Club is a regular program that brings together NAVBO members to discuss recent, impactful publications in the field of vascular biology. 
Symposiums and Conferences: NAVBO organizes a number of symposiums and conferences each year, which serve as platforms for members and non-members alike to share their research findings, network with other researchers, and stay abreast of the latest advancements in vascular biology. The highlight of these gatherings is the annual Vascular Biology meeting.
NAVBO also hosts online conferences focused on specific topics within vascular biology. These digital platforms enable more extensive participation from the international community, allowing researchers from around the world to present their work, engage in discussions, and build global networks.


== Membership ==
The North American Vascular Biology Organization is open to those with an interest in the subject of vascular biology who wish to engage with members to promote the study and dissemination of scientific information relevant to vascular biology, and who meet the criteria established by the council, which is elected by the membership.
