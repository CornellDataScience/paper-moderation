== Plot ==


=== Season 1 ===
On a hot night in Campoamargo, Almería, Ainhoa Sánchez (Mara López), daughter of the town's mayor, heads to a date in the greenhouse area, known as the "Plastic Sea". Suddenly there is a power outage and Ainhoa is brutally attacked and killed in the dark. The next morning, the crops are watered by her blood and nobody knows anything about the disappeared girl. The same day, Héctor Aguirre (Rodolfo Sancho), sergeant of the Civil Guard and chief of the Judicial Police, happens to arrive in Campoamargo and begins the crime investigation. A crime many people had reasons to commit, and few of them have alibis. Aguirre, a veteran of Afghanistan with severe anger management issues, knows he is in for the hardest investigation of his career.


=== Season 2 ===
After the murderer of Ainhoa Sánchez is caught and imprisoned, Campoamargo seems to have regained its calm - but not for long: Marta Ezquerro (Belén López), a local engineer, is found dead in a container with signs of having received a hard blow to the head. And she might not be the only victim; a new killer has emerged in the town and nobody is safe.
