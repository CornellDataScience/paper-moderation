Nevertheless, the area is popular with those wishing to enjoy a rural lifestyle within an easy commuting distance of the city.


== History ==
Settlement of the suburb as well as nearby Virginia began in 1869, after George Goyder surveyed the small area surrounding Virginia.
Its name follows that of a stream surveyed by George G. McLachlan of Goyder's No. 6 Survey Party of 1869, and named for McLachlan's cadet, Tom Bee (4 July 1850 – 21 November 1919)
In 1915 a rail siding named Wishart Siding (also known as 22 mile, the distance from the railhead at Darwin) after a contractor who built the first rail jetty at Port Darwin, opened on the North Australia Railway was established at a site approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) from Bees Creek. The siding served primarily as an accommodation facility for railway maintenance gangs who worked the line south to the town of Adelaide River The camp was expanded with additional accommodation buildings between 1946 and 1949, and closed with the rest of the line in 1976. The entire precinct is now heritage listed for its architectural and historical significance to the line. It is the only facility remaining of its kind along the alignment of the former railway.
