The British Fantasy Awards (BFA) are awarded annually by the British Fantasy Society (BFS), first in 1976.  Prior to that they were known as The August Derleth Fantasy Awards (see August Derleth Award).  First awarded in 1972 (to The Knight of Swords by Michael Moorcock) only for novels, the number of award categories increased and in 1976 the BFS renamed them collectively to the British Fantasy Awards. As of 2023 the award categories are:

Best Fantasy Novel (the Robert Holdstock Award)
Best Horror Novel (the August Derleth Award)
Best Novella
Best Short Fiction
Best Anthology
Best Collection
Magazine/Periodical
Best Independent Press
Best Artist
Best Audio
Best Non-Fiction
Best Newcomer (the Sydney J. Bounds Award)
The Karl Edward Wagner Award for "important contribution to the genre or the Society" is given at the discretion of the BFS committee.
The membership of the BFS vote to determine the shortlists of the awards, the winners being decided by juries.

== Award controversy of 2011 ==
In 2011, British writer Sam Stone won the British Fantasy Award but returned it three days later after editor and anthologist Stephen Jones posted a blog entry pointing out that three of the winning entries (and many of the shortlisted works) were published by Telos Publishing, a company owned by David Howe. At the time, Howe was also chair of the British Fantasy Society, British Fantasy Award coordinator, and partner of Stone.
