Following Show Lo's J-hip hop debut album Show Time, he broadened the 'hip hop culture' with an Eastern European style. In this he continues his partnership with producers Golden Melody Award winner and songwriter Di Zi (Chinese: 阿弟仔), Bi Guoyong (Chinese: 畢國勇) and Guo Jianliang (Chinese: 郭建良); plus Chen Zihong (Chinese: 陳子鴻) as well as choreographer Tommy (Chinese: 大目) of Dance Soul studios.

The first lead track, "機器娃娃" (Robotic Doll), is a hip hop number about the prevalence of electronic pets and on-line relationships.
The other lead track, "戀愛達人" (Love Expert), is a mid-tempo R&B duet with Dee Shu, that talks about a couple's interaction with each other in their love of fun. It is a cover of "I Believe" by German R&B group Bro'Sis. The music video was directed by Golden Melody Award winner Kuang Sheng (Chinese: 鄺盛). It features Luo and Hsu, who play a couple who wanting a night out separate from each other, goes clubbing but bumps into each other thereby starting a game of who's-got-the-upper-hand.
"灰色空間" (Grey Dimension) is the ending theme song of Taiwanese drama Outsider II (鬥魚), starring Luo. It is a cover of power ballad '사랑하면 할수록' Sarang hamyon hal soorok (If we are in love, then...) the theme song of Korean movie The Classic.
