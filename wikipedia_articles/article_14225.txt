The Distinguished Scholarly Book Award is presented annually by the American Sociological Association (ASA) in recognition of an ASA member's outstanding book published within two years prior to the award year.


== About ==
In 1956, the ASA presented its first annual book award, the MacIver Award. Since then, this award has gone through a number of changes, and is now known as the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award.
As it is currently named, the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award of the ASA was first given in 1986, and is presented at the ASA Annual Meeting every August. It is an ASA Major Award, given at association-level, in contrast to the various section-level ASA awards.
Members of the ASA make nominations for the prize. The Distinguished Scholarly Book Award selection committee, whose members serve two-year terms, selects award recipients.
