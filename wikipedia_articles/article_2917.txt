WBOP (95.5 FM) is a Contemporary Christian-formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Buffalo Gap, Virginia, US serving Staunton, Virginia and Augusta County, Virginia.  WBOP is owned and operated by Liberty University.


== History ==
The station first took the callsign WSPV on September 25, 1986 and was officially launched in 1988.


=== WSKO ===
Easy Radio Inc. bought the station and on March 24, 1989, the callsign was changed to WSKO and carried a country format, branded as "Super Country". In 1992, the format was changed to Hot Adult Contemporary.


=== WSXI/WZXI ===
On March 10, 1995, the callsign was changed from WSKO to WSXI, then to WZXI. In October 1997, WZXI dropped the Hot Adult Contemporary format for News/Talk. In September 2005 the News/Talk format was dropped and the station was completely silent for about a month. Vox Communications bought the station, and on October 7, 2005, WZXI became an Adult Hits format, branded as "Sam 95.5; Simply about music".
On August 16, 2006, the Adult/Variety Hits format on 95.5 FM was dropped when WBOP moved its format and callsign from 106.3 FM to 95.5 FM, and resumed its Oldies format as "Magic 95.5; Classic Top 40", while the 106.3 FM frequency went silent. 95.5 FM continued to keep the WZXI callsign until two weeks later on September 1, when the WBOP callsign officially moved from 106.3 FM to 95.5 FM. The 106.3 facility was moved to Charlottesville and became WCNR.
