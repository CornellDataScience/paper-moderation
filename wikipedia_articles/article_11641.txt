Linwood is a village in Butler County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 88 at the 2010 census.


== History ==
An attempt to settle the area was first made in 1857, on the banks of Skull Creek, a half-mile from current-day Linwood. A school was established in 1865, and a postmaster for the settlement, originally named Skull Creek, was appointed in 1868. It was later renamed Linwood for the linden trees growing near the creek. Linwood was incorporated as a village in 1888, shortly after the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad built a line through the settlement. Linwood served as a junction point for branch rail lines going to Superior and Hastings. Those rail lines were abandoned by the early 1960s, leaving Linwood without rail service. A 1963 flood devastated the community.
