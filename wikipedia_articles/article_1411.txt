Phantom Navigator is an album by the American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter, released on Columbia Records in 1987. Chick Corea played piano on "Mahogany Bird".


== Critical reception ==

The Windsor Star wrote that "the tunes are superficial, the concentration is on soprano sax, generally thin and shrill here, everything buried by batteries of keyboards, vampy electric bass and the thudding monotony of drum machines." The Los Angeles Times determined that "the creative level simply does not reflect Shorter's talents to optimum effect." The Philadelphia Inquirer called the album "bitterly disappointing fluff."
The AllMusic review by Richard S. Ginell stated: "On a sheer technical level, Wayne's soprano and tenor work is alright, yet on 'Yamanja' he does a depressingly mechanical sounding turn on a lyricon. Pass this right by."
