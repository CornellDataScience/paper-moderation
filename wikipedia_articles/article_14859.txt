The subspecies Alanbeuella corrugata lineata Nowell-Usticke, 1959 has become a synonym of Bursa granularis (Röding, 1798), itself a synonym of Dulcerana granularis (Röding, 1798)


== Distribution ==
This marine species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean off West Africa, the Canary Islands, Cape Verdes and Brazil; in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Lesser Antilles.


== Description ==
The maximum recorded shell length is 75 mm.
(Described as Ranella pustulosa Reeve, 1844) The shell is ovate, somewhat depressed, and ponderous, with a chestnut color. The whorls are encircled by two or three rows of large, livid chestnut-colored pimples. The varices are granulously ridged. The columella is granulously wrinkled, with white wrinkles. The outer lip is very flatly fimbriated, sinuated at the upper part, and is brown, radiated with whitish grooves. 


== Habitat ==
