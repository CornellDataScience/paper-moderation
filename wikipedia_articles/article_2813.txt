RAAF Bradfield Park was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) station located at the former suburb of Bradfield Park (now Lindfield), New South Wales during World War II.


== History of Bradfield Park ==
On 19 July 1924, the engineer Dr John Bradfield unveiled a sign-post "Bradfield" at the junction of Fiddens Wharf Road and Queens Road (Bradfield Road), West Lindfield. Ku-ring-gai Shire Council had earlier in 1924, decided to delineate 640 acres of land near the Lane Cove River for the new suburb. One of the councillors present stated:

"...that it would be fitting to call the new suburb Bradfield so that it numbers among its citizens the designer of the bridge and in this way its pride would be permanently recorded."
Bradfield Park was originally planned as a garden suburb. but from 1940 a station was built on the grounds, to house  a number of RAAF and WAAAF units. During World War II, more than 200,000 members of the RAAF and the WAAAF received training on their way to service in World War II.
After World War II the base was utilised as a migrant hostel for new arrivals in Australia and for Australian families in urgent need of accommodation due to the acute housing shortage.
The site was later cleared and reclaimed for housing. A RAAF Memorial was officially opened to commemorate the former base on 29 October 2006.
