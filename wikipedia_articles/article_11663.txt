=== Summary ===
Cole Custer started on pole, but Christopher Bell overtook him and proved to have the fastest car of the night. Bell won both stages and was able to prevent contenders Custer, Justin Allgaier, and Chase Briscoe from passing him on a straightaway. Tyler Reddick clinched the regular season championship after Stage 2.
A caution was thrown on lap 128 after C. J. McLaughlin slammed the turn 3 wall. Reddick pit as his car needed repairs while the leaders stayed out. Reddick went out front when the leaders made green-flag stops between laps 165 and 175 as no cautions occurred afterwards. With 25 laps remaining, Reddick's lead increased to 10 seconds, prompting him to save fuel. Bell began catching up to Reddick, closing in the gap. Ultimately, Reddick (despite his car sputtering over the last three laps) was able to hold off Bell to win the race. For the playoffs, John Hunter Nemechek and Ryan Sieg took the final two spots on points over Gray Gaulding and Jeremy Clements.
