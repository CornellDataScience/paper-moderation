But before 1990 no Maoist existed in this region. When local indigenous people got looted. Their lands were taken forcefully, they were treated as a labour in their own villages for a time of Food. They have to migrate to big cities in Search of job, some of them were sold. Government never listen to them they only take votes and a lots of resources worth trillions of dollars annually. The indigenous people feel like they are being cheated. They opposed about it in front of the government but government fired bullets on them. On 10 October 1968 police in Chainpur fired multiple round of bullets on a crowd of Birsa Seva Dal organized big gathering of peaceful protesters. Even nowadays they are being cheated by the local shopkeepers. The shopkeepers do a lots of fraud like in weight, duplicate. They take full money and give less or duplicate goods. They take the disadvantage of uneducated local people. Because government never provided education to them. The police, local officers and other governmental officers never supported them.
