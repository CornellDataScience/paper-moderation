The firm has been named among the most innovative architecture firms by Fast Company, the fastest growing architecture firm, and the architecture firm of choice by Wired.
The firm was an early signatory of the Architecture 2030 challenge, a global initiative stating that all new buildings and major renovations reduce their fossil-fuel GHG-emitting consumption by 50 percent by 2010, incrementally increasing the reduction for new buildings to carbon neutral by 2030. In addition, the firm is recognized as CarbonNeutral® certified by Natural Capital Partners and has signed the Amazon Climate Pledge.


== History ==
The firm was founded in 1943 by Seattle architects Floyd Naramore, William J. Bain, Clifton Brady, and Perry Johanson, and was initially called Naramore, Bain, Brady & Johanson. The architects formed the partnership during World War II to accept large-scale federal commissions in the area, including expansion of the Bremerton Naval Shipyard, but remained together after the war. The firm remained focused on projects in the Pacific Northwest region, growing into its largest architectural firm, before accepting projects in other areas of the United States. In 1976, the firm merged with Columbus, Ohio-based Nitschke–Godwin–Bohm to form the modern NBBJ.
NBBJ is the master planner for Net City, Tencent's smart city-concept urban development in Shenzhen which was announced in June 2020.: 65
