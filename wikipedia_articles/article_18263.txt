Seo Jung-won (born 17 December 1970) is a South Korean football manager and former player, he is the currently head coach of Chinese Super League club Chengdu Rongcheng.


== Playing career ==
A winger who had explosive pace, Seo was nicknamed the "Nalssaendori", which means an agile man in Korean. He played for South Korean under-23 team in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, and scored against Sweden. He was reportedly offered a contract from FC Barcelona and other European club giants after his performances in the Olympics, but he stayed South Korea to serve a two-year mandatory military service. He also played for South Korea in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and scored the equaliser in a 2–2 draw with Spain.
After serving in Sangmu FC, Seo longed to play in Europe and left for Germany and the Netherlands to participate in tryouts. In the summer of 1997, he succeeded to contract with Portuguese club Benfica and played four pre-season games for them. However, the Korea Football Association didn't approve of his overseas employment to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup with him.
In January 1998, Seo joined French club Strasbourg, becoming the first South Korean player to play in the Ligue 1. He successfully spent his first season by contributing to their survival in the Ligue 1, but he was pushed to the bench the next season after his manager was replaced. In summer, he participated in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, although he got chickenpox transferred from his son. He showed unnoticeable performance during South Korea's elimination in the group stage.
In February 1999, he returned to South Korea and joined Suwon Samsung Bluewings. He led Suwon to 12 trophies including two Asian Club Championships for six years. Lastly, he played for Austria Salzburg and SV Ried in Austria. While playing in Austrian Bundesliga, he was evaluated as the best footballer in Austria by two media Kurier and Sportwoche.


== Managerial career ==
After South Korea's head coach Pim Verbeek resigned in July 2007, Seo entered the list for the vacant managerial position for the national team. From 2009 to 2010, he and his former national teammate and close friend, Hong Myung-bo, worked together as a part of the coaching staff for the South Korea under-20 and under-23 team. In 2010, Seo joined the coaching staff of the senior team under manager Cho Kwang-rae. Since 2012, he has been a member of the coaching staff of the Suwon Samsung Bluewings, becoming the club's manager in 2013. Under his tenure, the Bluewings finished the 2014 and 2015 seasons as runner-ups and won the Korean FA Cup in 2016. The FA Cup Final was notable as it featured Suwon Samsung Bluewings and FC Seoul, one of the biggest K League rivalries. The match went into extra time after FC Seoul scored a goal in the 93rd minute, leveling the aggregate score to 3–3 over two legs. After a scoreless extra time period, the final was decided over penalties where Suwon Samsung Bluewings won 10–9. This was Seo's first silverware of his managing career.
