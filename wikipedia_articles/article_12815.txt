Passi, officially known as the City of Passi (Kinaray-a: Syudad kang Passi/Syudad ka Passi; Hiligaynon: Dakbanwa sang Passi; Filipino: Lungsod ng Passi), is a  component city in the province of Iloilo, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 88,873 people.
Passi covers a total land area of 25,139 hectares (62,120 acres), comprising 5.39% of the provincial land area of Iloilo. Its terrain is predominantly flat, extending along the Jalaur and Lamunan Rivers, with mountainous regions situated in the northern part of the city.
Passi claims the moniker "The Sweet City at The Heart of Panay" being the beating heart-shaped center of Panay, with a rich history in rice, pineapple and sugarcane. It holds the distinction of being the only component city in the province of Iloilo, and ranks as the largest in terms of land area and income, and second only to Oton in population size.


== History ==
Passi was a settlement founded by the three Malayan brothers named Dig- on, Tokiab and Umawang at the beginning of its history. This settlement (purok) was well protected from possible attack from adjacent purok.
Passi was discovered and established as a mission parish by Spanish explorers in 1584 under the patronage of St. William of Maleval. In 1593, Padre Juan Villamayor, an Augustinian friar, became its first resident priest. Initially, the mission church was constructed using lightweight materials near the Jalaur River's riverbank. However, in 1600, it was relocated to its current site and rebuilt using stones, slabs, and lime for its foundation and walls. Parishioners contributed by transporting necessary materials to the construction site during their visits to the church. Construction was completed during Padre Pedro Ceberio's tenure, with Salvador “Badong” Panes Perfecto serving as the town's Captain at the time.
Passi holds historical significance as one of the oldest Spanish settlements in Iloilo. Established as a pueblo (community settlement of natives) in 1766, it appointed Don Martin Saligumba as its inaugural gobernadorcillo.
In 1957, the sitio of Agtabo within Passi was officially recognized as a barrio, formerly part of the barrio (district) of Salngan. In the same year, the barrio of Santa Rosa was officially renamed Santo Tomas.
Passi experienced significant development during this period, becoming a center for trade and commerce due to its strategic location. This growth attracted more investment to the municipality, resulting in increased income, population, and territorial expansion. As a result, Passi was recognized as the first component city in the Island of Panay. On January 30, 1998, President Fidel V. Ramos signed R.A. 8469, officially converting Passi into a city.


=== Popular legend ===
According to popular legend, Spanish conquistadors stumbled on a small hut by the river's bank where an old woman was found winnowing pounded rice. One of them asked her, “¿Cómo se llama este lugar?” not speaking the native language. Misinterpreting the question, the woman responded with "Ah, pasi," which in her language meant "rice", assuming they were asking about the contents of her basket. An alternative interpretation is that "pasi" was a local Malay dialect from the word 'putih' which means "white" - possibly referring to the encounter with the Spaniards themselves. Following this encounter, the Spanish settlers adopted the name Pasi for the location, which eventually transformed into the present-day name of Passi.
Similar narratives surrounding the origins of place names are prevalent in various towns and cities across the Philippines. These tales typically involve Spanish explorers seeking the name of a location from non-Spanish speaking natives and adopting their response as the name.


=== Historical notes about Passi ===
Passi served as the pre-war capital of Iloilo Province from January 1942 to April 16, 1942, until the arrival of the Japanese Occupation Force.
Passi was designated as the quartermaster depot of United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) for supplying food to the army that resisted in Bataan through Capiz.
The central school served as the seat of the provincial government offices, including the Agricultural and Industrial Bank and the Philippine National Bank, prior to the Japanese landing in Panay.
Passi housed the initial warehouse of the Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas in Central Panay, which was later repurposed as the Roman Catholic Church. Additionally, it served as the warehouse for the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFE) for storing food supplies destined for Corregidor and Bataan.
During the war years, Ibajay Cave and the mountain northeast of the poblacion served as the headquarters of the Municipal Resistance Government under the leadership of Mayor Filoteo Palmares and Municipal Treasurer Pedro Oro.
Passi Central Elementary School (now Passi I Central School) had the first clean ground in the province before the war.
One of the earliest regional high schools established in Iloilo was founded in Passi shortly after liberation. It acquired a vast site of 12 hectares, making it one of the first to do so. The athletic field, carved from a hill and meticulously prepared by Mayor Palmares, was leveled and enhanced in time for the Unit Athletic Meet held between 1949 and 1959, which was noted for its grandeur.
Passi holds a historical record for hosting the First Provincial Athletic Meet in the interior before the war. It sustained athletic delegations from various towns in Iloilo generously, with surplus meat and cattle heads sold to support the athletic fund. This accomplishment remains unmatched in the history of athletic meets in Iloilo.
Passi has a tradition of hospitality deeply rooted in Filipino customs. The city's efforts in welcoming visitors, including individual guests, visiting teams, and delegations, are noteworthy. They are known for generously providing abundant food and beverages, symbolizing their warm hospitality.
Before the war, Passi possessed the largest cattle ranch in Panay due to its extensive grazing land.
During the war, Passi served as a significant supplier of meat for the army and a major source of rice and corn for the sustenance of guerrilla forces and the Provincial Guards of the Civil Resistance Movement of Free Panay and Romblon Gov. Tomas Confesor.
During the Spanish colonial period, Passi was inhabited by affluent families who resided outside of Iloilo City.
In 1999, Passi achieved the status of being the first component city of Iloilo.

Passi possesses favorable physical resources, including fertile soil along rolling hills and narrow valley plains, abundant surface and groundwater, and a climate without distinct dry and wet seasons. These conditions are conducive to cultivating various agricultural products such as rice, sugarcane, and pineapple. In response to fluctuations in the sugar industry, local farmers have diversified into other crops such as corn, pineapple, mongo, root crops, and other farm-based products. The city also presents investment opportunities for agri-industrial developments.
Industrial development is a key focus area for the local government, given Passi's designation as one of the five Agro-Industrial districts in the province. It serves as the site for the People's Industrial Enterprise (PIE's) District Agro-Industrial Center (DAIC) in the 4th District.

=== Pintados de Pasi ===

The Pintados de Pasi Festival, inaugurated in March 1998 to commemorate Passi City's attainment of cityhood, stands as a significant cultural celebration in the heart of Iloilo province. Over the years, it has evolved into one of the most renowned festivals in the Visayan region, deeply ingrained in the local community's identity. The festival draws large crowds, with its highlight being theatrical street dancing performances characterized by vigorous and dynamic movements. Participants adorned in traditional body tattoos, featuring intricate geometrical designs, depict ancestral narratives that showcase the area's heritage and way of life.
The festival's dances, distinguished by robust and dynamic movements, appear to have originated organically within the local culture, devoid of external influences such as combat dances, folk plays, ritual actions, or specific character types. Sustaining such a festival relies heavily on historical and cultural sources, which serve as foundational materials preserving the authenticity and significance of the event.
The island's initial inhabitants referred to it as Aninipay, named after the prevalent plant species in the region. Subsequently, with the arrival of the Malayans, the island was renamed Madia-as, after its highest peak.
Contrary to common knowledge, the initial group of Spaniards who arrived on the island bestowed a different title upon it, naming it "Isla de Pintados" upon encountering tattooed individuals whom they referred to as "pintados" or "painted people." Tattooing was a widespread custom across the island, as detailed by chronicler Miguel de Loarca in his account in Historia Pre-Hispanica de Filipinas Sobre la Isla de Panay.
Culturally, the residents of Panay employed tattoos as a means to showcase their combat achievements. A man's status as a warrior was often determined by the number of tattoo marks adorning his body. The refinement of the pintado tradition elevated tattooing to an art form, characterized by meticulous order, symmetry, and coordination, eliciting admiration from observers.
In traditional Panay society, while men adorned their bodies with tattoos extensively, there was a customary rule limiting women to wearing tattoos on only one side of their arms.


=== Christmas events ===
The city hosts Christmas events annually from the middle of December until the first Sunday of January at Plaza Paloma. The festivities typically commence with a grand fireworks display on the opening day, followed by the illumination of lights and the setup of food stalls.

Carnivals and rides are set up in the plaza for public enjoyment, and small kiosk stores offer a variety of items such as clothing, jewelry, and home decor. The festival is eagerly anticipated by residents of the city.

=== St. William the Hermit of Maleval Parish Church ===

The church is notable for its militaristic architecture, characterized by massive buttresses supporting the front and back walls, reflecting its design as a 'fortress church'. It was constructed to replace previous churches demolished by an earthquake in 1612 and subsequent fires. In 1856, Friar Pedro Ceberio undertook the restoration of the church, which had deteriorated over time. The current structure is the outcome of his restoration efforts.
Typical of churches from this era, one can observe the Augustinian seal on the archway over one of the side entrances, suggesting their involvement in its construction. Historical records are ambiguous regarding the placement of entrances, leading historians to speculate about the location of the original main entrance. Some evidence suggests that it could have been the doorway on the southeast corner of the church, leading to the 'Garden of Saints'. The church remained intact through the Revolution and the Philippines American War, but in 1932, it suffered damage when its roof was blown away by a typhoon.
The church is encircled by a 'Garden of the Saints,' adorned with 25 to 30 statues of saints, which were contributed by parishioners over time. Inside the church's lofty belfry are three bells, two of considerable size and one smaller. To ring the larger bell, a chain connected to the clapper is stepped on to strike the sound rim, with the intensity of the step determining the volume of the sound. The other two bells are rung manually by striking their clappers against the sound rim, requiring the bell ringer to be in close proximity to the bells during ringing.


==== Foundation of the church ====
Passi was discovered and established as a mission parish by Spanish explorers in 1584, under the patronage of St. William of Maleval, whose feast is celebrated annually on February 10. In 1593, Padre Juan Villamayor, an Augustinian friar, became its first resident priest. Initially, the mission church was constructed using lightweight materials near the Jalaur River's riverbank. However, in 1600, it was relocated to its current site and rebuilt using stones, slabs, and lime for its foundation and walls. Parishioners contributed by transporting necessary materials to the construction site during their visits to the church. Construction was completed during Padre Pedro Ceberio's tenure, with Salvador “Badong” Panes Perfecto serving as the town's Captain at the time.

Schism and Abaca
Around 1821, during Padre Apolinario Villanueva's tenure as Parish Priest, a schism occurred between him and the Spanish populace of the town. As a result, he relocated the seat of the Parish Church to Abaca, where he constructed a chapel. When Padre Martin succeeded him, the seat of the parish church was returned to Passi.

Aglipayon Revolution
During the Filipino Revolution against the Spanish government, there was a call from the Filipino Clergy for reforms. Padre Rafael Murillo, the Parish Priest at that time, was a follower and supporter of the Aglipay movement. He was later elevated to the rank of an Aglipayan Bishop and brought his family with him. To support his family, he demanded tributes from the people. The residents of Passi, under the leadership of Captain Badong Perfecto, strongly objected to this, leading to Padre Joaquin's removal from his position not long after.

Spanish Era to Post-War Years
Padre Lorenzo Diaz, a Catholic Augustinian Priest, administered the Parish during a certain period. The year 1891 marked the end of the tenure of the last Spanish Augustinian Parish Priest of Passi, Padre Bravo. In 1893, after three centuries of Christianization, Passi produced its first priest, Padre Amado Panes Perfecto. He studied at the University of Salamanca in Spain, earning a Doctor of Canon Law degree, a rare privilege at the time. Appointed as the first Filipino Priest of Passi, he constructed a convent furnished with carved furniture and imported chinaware and utensils. One of his notable creations is the "Flores de Mayo Salve," which has become a tradition in the town.

World War II
During World War II, Passinhons faced significant challenges as the town experienced widespread destruction. Spanish-built houses were engulfed in flames, set ablaze by guerrillas, resulting in the town being left vacant for the occupying Japanese forces. Much of the wooden structures, including the church and convent, were reduced to rubble, leaving only the stones behind. The church was repurposed as a garrison for the Japanese military and later served as the headquarters for the Residence Civil Government. Filipino troops, aligned with the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary, played a crucial role in the liberation of Passi, collaborating with local guerrilla groups to engage Japanese forces, ultimately contributing to the conclusion of World War II.

Lady Caycay earthquake
The 1948 Lady Caycay earthquake struck Panay Island, Philippines, on January 25, 1948, at 1:46 AM UTC+08:00. As a result of the earthquake, the bell tower of Passi suffered significant damage. The tall tower collapsed entirely, causing the bells to plummet to the ground. Although most of the bells were undamaged, one of the larger bells sustained a minor crack. During the tenure of Padre Parreñas, wood and nipa roofing were installed. Temporary wooden posts were erected on the eastern side of the church to house the bells after the bell tower was damaged in the 1948 earthquake. Padre Buenaflor replaced the roofing with galvanized iron. Further enhancements, such as relocating the altar to the main entrance, were carried out during Padre Castaño's tenure.
The present church, featuring steel trusses, washed walls, benches, and a new permanent belfry, was constructed along with the demolition of the old parish convent, Assumption School, and former Social Hall under the direction of Msgr. Eligio Villavert, the 81st Parish Priest of Passi. In 1997, the Parish of St. William of Maleval welcomed another Passinhon Priest, Msgr. Felipe Dativo Palomo, P.C. Supported by the Parish Councils and local and international Passinhon Parishioners, ambitious projects were undertaken.
The completion and blessing of the Jubilee Hall, the largest and tallest parish convent in the Diocese, occurred in 2000. Attention turned to the incomplete church behind the convent. Notably, the main entrance was absent, rendering Passi Church unique. Landscaping of the Western side and the installation of statues of saints were undertaken. The altar was relocated to its original position, facilitating the restoration of the original main entrance according to the Augustinian architectural design. The restoration included ornate granite flooring, an echo-proof ceiling, decorative stained glass, a large steel door at the main entrance, and modern lighting. Additionally, on the Eastern side, features such as Avenida de la Virgin Maria, the Adoration Chapel, a parking area, and a large relief map of Passi City can be observed.
On October 26, 2010, the Church of St. William of Maleval observed its Solemn Dedication, an annual event commemorated by the Parishioners to reflect on the abundant grace bestowed upon the Christian Community of Passi.

Typhoon Yolanda
On November 8, 2013, Typhoon Yolanda, also known internationally as Typhoon Haiyan, struck the Visayas Region, causing significant damage to infrastructure, including the church. Three years after its restoration, the church sustained partial damage, with the ceiling outside the church and part of the altar collapsing. As a result, the church was temporarily closed, and masses were held at the Jubilee Hall. However, it reopened to the public on December 16, 2013, following extensive reconstruction and repair efforts.
