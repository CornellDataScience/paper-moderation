He is bald, usually wearing a hard hat or an Ushanka to conceal it. He is often seen carrying a chainsaw or a hunting rifle, wearing a jacket and jeans. Despite his menacing demeanor, Vick is often stays determined in light of threats from the forest, his superiors and poverty, not wishing to be in conflict with anyone if possible, despite sometimes seeking vengeance as a hunter. Vick later decided to quit logging and becomes a tour guide to preserve the forest with his animal friends. (Voiced by: Toni Thompson, Paul "Maxx" Rinehart, Brian A. Bullock)
