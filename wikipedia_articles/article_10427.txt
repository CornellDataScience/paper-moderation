Prathapachandran had to end his formal schooling by the 9th standard. He later moved to Kollam, and at the age of 14, he moved to Madras, hoping to be a movie actor. During his initial years, though he failed to garner any significant movie roles, he lent voice in radio plays and acted in plays organized by the Madras Malayali association. He got his first movie role in Viyarppinte Vila (1962), in which he acted as a man in his 70s. As he couldn't sustain the success, he returned to Kollam, and switched fulltime to theatre, working with Kalidasa Kalakendram.
