== Career ==
Producer Issaki Sundar saw Dushyanth at the Sivaji Productions office and offered him the opportunity to make his acting debut. After initially rejecting the offer, he ultimately agreed after consulting with his uncle Prabhu and cousin Vikram Prabhu. Dushyanth was also credited as Junior Sivaji during the production of the film. The film was named Success, after the first on-screen dialogue of Sivaji from the film Parasakthi (1952). The film opened to mixed reviews, with a critic noting: "the movie surprises us with a nice turn of events. It definitely energizes the movie and gets us interested again. Looking back on the first half after this, we realize that the movie has actually been quite clever in setting up stock characters, but in a slightly different way that makes the twist surprising." Another reviewer noted: "To sum up, Success is not the right film for Jr. Ganesan to be successful." His second film was Machi (2004), with a reviewer noting: "Dushyanth as the â€˜hero' has improved leaps and bounds from Success, in dialogue delivery and expressions." He has since not been seen in films as an actor.
He worked extensively on the sets of Sivaji Productions' Aasal as a producer. In 2015, he set up Eshan Productions and began his first film Meen Kuzhambum Mann Paanaiyum (2016), as an individual producer.
In May 2022, Dushyanth announced plans of making an acting comeback, and signed on to appear in a film titled Shooting Star by M. J. Ramanan.
