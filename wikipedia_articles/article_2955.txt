It was assigned to the 9th Armored Division on 15 July 1942, being converted into an armored field artillery battalion. The battalion departed the New York Port of Embarkation on 20 August 1944 and returned to the United States on 9 October 1945 via the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation, Virginia, being inactivated there the same day.

Symbolism
Shield
The scarlet is for the Field Artillery, the gold lightning bolt is symbolic of the speed and power of the Armored Artillery.
Crest
The design of the crest alludes primarily to the 73rd Artillery's participation in the 1944 winter counter offensive against Germany and is symbolized by the caltrops (a heraldic military device used to impede and delay the movements of the enemy). The two smaller caltrops allude to St. Vith and Echternock, and the larger to Bastogne, the later is blue in reference to the Distinguished Unit Citation awarded the battalion for its role in the defense of Bastogne. The snow refers to the severe winter weather during the period the battalion made its stand against the German counter offensive and is symbolized by two arms breaking a spear. Had it not been for this delaying action the Germans would have taken Bastogne before the 101st Airborne Division arrived.

Background
The coat of arms was originally approved for the 73rd Armored Field Artillery Battalion on 17 March 1943. It was re-designated for the 73rd Artillery Regiment on 5 December 1957.
