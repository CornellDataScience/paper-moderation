Grant Thomas Green (born September 27, 1987) is an American former professional baseball second baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, San Francisco Giants, and Washington Nationals. Green attended the University of Southern California (USC) and played college baseball for the USC Trojans.


== High school career ==
Green played baseball at Canyon High School in Anaheim, California. As a high school sophomore, Green batted .430 (31-for-72) with eight doubles and 22 RBI.  In his junior season, he batted .455 (40-for-88) with three home runs, 30 RBI and 14 stolen bases, a performance he duplicated as a senior when he batted .453 with four home runs, 22 RBI, and 14 stolen bases.   Green earned first team honors from the California Interscholastic Federation and the Orange County Register.  After his senior season, he was the 14th-round draft choice of the San Diego Padres, but he opted to attend the University of Southern California (USC) instead.
Green also experienced success with the 2005 U.S. Junior National Team. He batted .412 with six RBI and two stolen bases at the 2005 COPABE "AAA" Pan Am Junior Championships in Villahermosa, Mexico.


== College career ==
Green started every game for the USC Trojans as a true freshman in 2007.  He batted .316 (72-for-228) with two home runs, 14 doubles, 24 RBI and six stolen bases.  Green collected several postseason honors, including Pac-10 Conference Co-Freshman of the Year. As a sophomore in 2008, Green batted .390 (80-for-205) with nine home runs, 46 RBI, and 10 stolen bases. He was named a member of Baseball America's All-America third team and also earned All-Pacific-10 Conference honors.
Before Green's junior season, Baseball America rated him as the third best college prospect in the nation. However, Green's junior season began slowly, as he was batting only .234 after 13 games. However, he turned in an impressive performance by season's end, batting .374 (79-for-211) overall, with four home runs, 32 RBI, and 16 stolen bases in 24 attempts. He led the Trojans with a .435 on-base percentage and 26 multi-hit games.
In 2007, Green played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. He returned to the CCBL in 2008 to play for the Chatham Anglers, and was honored by the league as its top pro prospect. He was among the league leaders in most offensive categories but struggled defensively, committing 17 errors in 41 games.


== 2009 Draft ==
As the 2009 baseball draft approached, Green was very highly regarded among experts, who expected him to be drafted high in the first round. He was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the first round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft as the 13th overall selection as a shortstop. Although some scouts had projected him as a future third baseman, both Green and the Athletics stated a desire for him to remain at shortstop. Green was advised by high-profile sports agent Scott Boras. He signed a contract with a signing bonus of $2.75 million on August 17, 2009, just minutes before the deadline to sign draft picks passed.
