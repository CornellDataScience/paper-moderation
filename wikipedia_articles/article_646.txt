The station, which is unstaffed, consists of a side platform serving a single track on a low embankment. There is no station building but a shelter is provided on the platform. In addition, the municipal authorities have set up a waiting room named "Aki Sakura-kan" (meaning Autumn Cherry Blossom Room) near the station entrance.

== History ==
The private Kitakyushu Railway, which had a track between Hakata and Higashi-Karatsu by 1926 and had expanded southwards to Yamamoto by 1929. In a later phase of expansion, the track was extended west from Yamamoto to Imari, which opened as the western terminus on 1 March 1935. This station was opened on the same day as an intermediate station on the new track under the name Sari Onsen (佐里温泉). In 1936, the station name was changed to Matsuura Onsen (松浦温泉). The Kitakyushi Railway was nationalised on 1 October 1937 and Japanese Government Railways (JGR) assumed control of the station, changed the name again to Sari and designated the track which served it as part of the Chikuhi Line. The station was closed on 10 August 1941 and reopened on 1 June 1946. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu.
