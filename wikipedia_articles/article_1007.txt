== ISS Final Series Thailand ==

The final series of the inaugural ISTAF SuperSeries was held in Fashion Island, Bangkok in Thailand from 28 June 2012 to 1 July 2012. This tournament saw the debut appearance of the Vietnam men's national team, as well as the first European team, Germany. Germany's appearance is a sign of the increasing popularity of the sport and a growing testament that the International Sepaktakraw Federation is meeting its objective of spreading the sport beyond its roots of South-East Asia. Their performance in the final series was also encouraging. Even though Germany eventually lost both its games to Malaysia and the United States, it did manage to gain two points in the group stage by winning two sets. Vietnam's appearance too was promising, even though it lost both matches like Germany, it won three sets from the two games.
Malaysia's men national team came back strong in this edition as well, after its disappointing exit in the quarter-final to Indonesia in the previous series. It defeated Philippines in straight sets during the quarter-final, and also overcame a resilient South Korea in the semi-finals. However, they failed to find an answer to the supremacy of Thailand and had to settle for the runner-up spot. South Korea continues to show its defiance that the sport of sepaktakraw is dominated by South-East Asian countries, coming in at second runner-up for the third time in the season, still chasing after the elusive silver or gold medals.
The expectation of the returning South Korea's women national team was high after their runner-up spot in the first series. However, things did not pan out well for them as Vietnam, the emerging powerhouse of the women's sepaktakraw after Thailand, defeated them in the semi-finals. Even though Vietnam lost in the finals to Thailand in a repeat of the last series, it marked the successive appearance of Vietnam on the podium for every series in the first season of ISTAF SuperSeries as two silvers and two bronzes. South Korea subsequently failed Malaysia in a close match which ended 3-2 in Malaysia's favor.


=== Team Allocation ===
