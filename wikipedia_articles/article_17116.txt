X Factor Italia is a TV show that airs on prime time in Italy. The singing competition is the Italian version of Britain's The X Factor. As of Season 17, it is currently hosted by Francesca Michielin. Francesco Facchinetti hosted the show's first four seasons before being replaced by Alessandro Cattelan for Season 5 up to Season 14 before being replaced by Ludovico Tersigni for one season.
While the first four seasons were aired on Rai Due, the second channel of Italian public television service, at the moment the show is broadcast on Sky Uno, the main channel of Sky Italy.
The judges, who all belong to the Italian and international music or television world, were 3 from Season 1 to Season 3 (when the categories were: Groups, 16–24, 25+). Since Season 4, the 16-24 category was split into two parts (Boys and Girls), following the British example, therefore the judges became 4.
The programme's success is witnessed by the number of singers who became famous after the show. Among the others we can notice Giusy Ferreri from Season 1, Noemi from Season 2, Marco Mengoni from Season 3, Ruggero Pasquarelli from Season 4, Francesca Michielin from Season 5, Chiara Galiazzo, Mahmood and Le Donatella from Season 6, Michele Bravi from Season 7, Lorenzo Fragola and Madh from Season 8, Enrico Nigiotti and Måneskin from Season 11.
