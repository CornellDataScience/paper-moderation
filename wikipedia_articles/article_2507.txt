Innocence & Instinct is the second studio album by American Christian rock band Red. It was released on February 10, 2009 through Essential Records and Sony Music. It was produced by Rob Graves.
The standard edition of the album contains 10 tracks. The first single "Fight Inside" was released on October 26, 2008. The single debuted at No. 1 on the R&R Christian Rock chart. The album's second single, "Never Be the Same", was released to Christian CHR soon thereafter. On December 12, the third single from the album, "Death of Me", was released to Active, Mainstream, and Alternative Rock stations. The band also released a deluxe edition which features four bonus tracks and a DVD. Some copies of the album contain the song "Forever" as track nine instead of "Out from Under". The track "Shadows" was co-written by Breaking Benjamin guitarist/vocalist Ben Burnley. The album debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, selling 39,000 copies in its first week. It was widely acclaimed by critics, who deemed it superior to the band's debut album, End of Silence, praising the songwriting, musicianship and the band's attempt to create a distinguishable sound.
The Deluxe Edition of Innocence & Instinct went as high as No. 2 on iTunes Top Selling Rock Albums Chart and No. 5 on Top-Selling Albums overall.
For the album, an alternate reality game was orchestrated by the band members. Red fans went through hidden web pages and passwords until around the time the album itself was released, when the final page was revealed, which contained a video message from the band itself, nine "treasures" (including posters, videos, and an unreleased track), and a message telling the puzzle participants not to post the contents on the internet or share them.
Drums on the album were played by Joe Rickard, the band's touring drummer. Rickard was not an official member of Red when the album was released but was made a permanent member later in 2009. Rickard departed from the band in late January 2014.
In an interview on The Daily Rock, Jasen Rauch talked about the band not wanting "Ordinary World" added to the album. He stated that Red originally arranged the song as something to play live but that the label pushed for it to be added to the album.
The album was nominated for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album in the 2010 Grammy Awards. It won for Best Rock Album at the 41st GMA Dove Awards in 2010.
As of 2011, the album has sold over 260,000 copies.
