Van der Want's live performance has been described as follows: "His cutting insights into matters of the heart, and satirical take on the music industry have probably made him a few enemies, but anyone with an ounce of self respect or taste should not be able to deny the talent behind the f*** off attitude. He says what he thinks, but he does so with such frightening beauty that you can't look away."
