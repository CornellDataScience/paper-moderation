Emil Warmiński (15 March 1881 – 9 June 1909) was a Polish physician, social and national activist and founder of the Polish House in Bydgoszcz.


== Biography ==


=== Youth ===

Emil Warmiński was born on 15 March 1881 in a tenement at 6 Plac Poznański in Bromberg, then part of the German Empire. He was the son of Otto Ferdynand, a court secretary, and Małgorzata née Siudzińska, from Szubin. He had three sisters, Maria, Helena and Stanisława. His father died when he was six years old: his education was taken care of by his uncle, Stanisław Warmiński, a well-known and respected physician of the city. Stanisław took also under his tutorship Emil's sisters.
From 1890 to 1899, the young Emil studied at the downtown gymnasium, then organized as a realschule. There, he passed his matura. He was said to be an extremely talented student.


=== Medical studies in Germany ===
Immediately after graduating from gymnasium, he moved to Marburg to start medical studies, there he was the only Pole. After a first successful semester, Warmiński went to Berlin, where a large Polish studying diaspora was present, to continue his education.
Already in 1903, he contributed to the establishment of a building company aiming at purchasing real estate for Polish social and cultural associations.
Local journal "Dziennik Bydgoski" reports that the young student was provoked by insults thrown towards Poles by professor Schuman, from the Humboldt University. This event deeply troubled Emil: he replied to such insults in wording that could have earned him a dismissal from the faculty.
He decided to join the Sokół Polish Gymnastic Society and began to work for Polish organizations in exile. In 1904, he completed his studies in the city of Freiburg im Breisgau. The same university conferred on him the title of Doctor of Medicine, for his presentation of a thesis dealing with typhoid fever.


=== Return to Bromberg ===

Before moving back to his home town, Emil Warmiński had to complete the compulsory six-month long military service in Berlin.

It was only in May 1905, that he returned to Bydgoszcz (then Bromberg) and launched his medical practice. His house and office were located at 9 Gdańska Street and bore on the building wall for the first time in the city a plaque with a Polish inscription "Doctor" (and not the German Arzt). This move exposed him to all kinds of animosity and harassment from some German citizens of Bromberg. He was hard at work, often selflessly helped his Polis fellows, sometimes treating them at his own expenses. Once settled, Emil additionally joined the national and social activities of the Poles in the city. From Gdańska street, the doctor moves later his office to Dworcowa Street.
Indeed, he contributed to the revival of the activities of the local Polish Gymnastic Society "Sokół", presiding the institution from 1905 to 1908. He also took part in the actions of other movements:

the "Halka" Singing Society (Polish: Towarzystwo Śpiewu „Halka”) as a board member;
the Society of Polish-Catholic Workers (Polish: Towarzystwo Robotników Polsko-Katolickich);
the Industrial Association of Bydgoszcz (Polish: Towarzystwo Przemysłowego w Bydgoszczy), created by Teofil Magdziński in 1872.
Furthermore, he assisted to the establishment of:

the Merchants' Society (Polish: Towarzystwo Kupców), becoming one of its member in 1909;
the Merchant Youth Society (Polish: Towarzystwo Młodzieży Kupieckiej);
the Nadnotecki Association of Doctors (Polish: Towarzystwo Lekarzy Nadnoteckich), created as a form of reaction against germanization.
During the period of Polish strikes caused by the ban on the use of the Polish language during religion classes (1907), Emil founded a library and a reading room for children. Later, he contributed to set up a reading room for women, which soon became the largest and most active institution of this type in the Province of Posen. In 1907, with the accumulated funds of his building company established four years ago while in studies in Germany, he purchased a building at 6 Gamm straße, today's 11 Doktora Emila Warmińskiego street. There Warmiński organized the first Polish House in the city, operating as a center of cultural and social life of Polish society under Prussian rule. It soon became the corner stone of the national Polish revival of Bydgoszcz. Unfortunately, the building was destroyed in August 1919, just before the city re-joined the newly re-created state of Poland.
"Invited to numerous rallies in Bydgoszcz, Gniezno, Inowrocław, Toruń and other nearby villages, Warmiński delivered passionate speeches in defense of the endangered Polish peoples", as wrote his wife Halina in her diary.


=== Fight against illness ===

Emil Warmiński used  to visit meetings and rallies, holding numerous honorary offices and writing numerous articles and dissertations for newspapers. Such an intensive work took its toll on his strength. The young activist doctor was weakened by tuberculosis and a serious instestinal disease. He attempted to fight these conditions with medications and rest in Italy, Switzerland and Zakopane (then in Austria-Hungary). After a partial recovery, he applied for the position of an assistant in the gynaecology Department of the Wrocław hospital. He relocated to the city upon the Oder in August 1908 and received successful bowel surgery immediately. However, he was still heavily weakened by tuberculosis and succumbed to it in June 1909, in Poznań.
Warmiński's remains carried back to Bromberg by train on 12 June 1909. His funeral took place the following day, a Sunday; the ceremony was attended by a large crowd of Bydgoszcz residents. From the Nowofarny cemetery chapel, the procession went along several streets of the city to Starofarny cemetery: at the grave, his choir "Halka" chanted the four-voice song "Na groby" (On the grave). Emil Warmiński was buried in the family vault in the Starofarny cemetery at 15 Grunwaldzka street.
Following his death, the editorial office of the "Dziennik Bydgoski" recalled the figure and merits of the honorable doctor of "Polish hearts and souls".
