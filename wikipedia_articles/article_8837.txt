Sutton Lifeboat Station was located at the village of Sutton-on-Sea, in the county of Lincolnshire.
A lifeboat was first stationed here by the Lincolnshire Coast Shipwreck Association (LCSA) in 1844, although it was preceded by a station at Huttoft from 1835. Management of the station was handed over to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1864.
With only a small number of launches and few lives saved over a 25-year period, the station was closed in 1913.


== History ==
In July 1835, the Lincolnshire Coast Shipwreck Association (LCSA) decided to place a lifeboat at Huttoft. A 24-foot boat had been ordered from Bell & Grange, of Grimsby, costing £109-12s-6d. The boat was named Birmingham as some funds were raised in the city. John Shaw was appointed Coxswain.
The boat was only launched once, in 1843, to the aid of the schooner Rocket, on passage from Sunderland to King's Lynn, driven ashore at Huttoft, Three lives were saved.
Finding crew for the boat was proving difficult at the remote location, and so in 1844, the boat was moved to a new station at Sutton-on-Sea. She would go on to launch 7 more times over the next twenty years, rescuing 28.
LCSA transferred their lifeboats and stations to the RNLI in 1864. A new boat was ordered from Forrestt of Limehouse, London, a 30-foot Self-righting 'pulling and sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one using oars and sail, which cost £190, and a new boathouse was constructed, costing a further £205. With all costs again met by funds raised in Birmingham, she was taken there for a naming ceremony on 29 November 1864, and named Birmingham No.1. She would launch 9 times, and save 13 lives.
On 3 December 1867, Birmingham No.1 was launched to the aid of the brig Clarinda, on passage from Ostend, Belgium to Sunderland, de-masted and driven ashore at Ingoldmells. Seven men were rescued from the vessel, which was later driven out to sea, and never seen again.
Birmingham No.1 was replaced in 1876 by the Caroline, a lifeboat that would serve Sutton on Sea for a further 12 years, and rescue 10.
On 16 December 1876, the Sutton lifeboat Caroline was launched to the aid of the barque Beecher Stowe. on passage from Denmark to London, when she was driven ashore. All 10 crew were rescued.
Two matching 31-foot self-righting lifeboats were funded at the bequest of Miss Caroline Berrey, constructed by Hansen in 1888. One was provided to Chapel Lifeboat Station, named John Alexander Berrey (ON 217), with the second boat sent to Sutton, and named Elizabeth Berrey (ON 218).
In 1897, the last boat to serve at Sutton was the Sir John (ON 408). A 35-foot self-righting lifeboat constructed by Thames Ironworks. Sir John would be launched 5 times in 16 years, but with no lives saved.
With a record of 8 launches and 5 lives saved over a period of 25 years, Sutton lifeboat station was closed in 1913. Sir John (ON 408) was transferred to Cemlyn and served a further 5 years, before joining the relief fleet. The station building in Sutton-on-Sea still stands, and is currently the Meridale Centre.
