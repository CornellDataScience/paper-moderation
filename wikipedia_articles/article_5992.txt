=== Local Level ===
At this level National Bal Bhavan and all affiliated State Bal Bhavans undertake preliminary screening for selecting candidates for National level camp. A 2- days camp for member children is organized at State Bal Bhavans. After local selection 8 children (2 in each stream) are nominated by the affiliated Bal Bhavans for their respective Zonal level camps. An additional nomination is sent in case the nominee is a child of special needs or from tribal areas.


=== Zonal Level ===
In the zonal level, the country has been divided into different zones – North, East, West, Central, and South. As there are large number of Bal Bhavans in the southern region, South Zone has further been divided into two zones – South-I and South-II Zones. Every year different Zonal Centers are identified for organizing zonal selection camps. As there are certain states where there are no Bal Bhavans, representation of these states are ensured through the Chief Secretaries of these states. Children selected at the local levels participate in these 3-days zonal level camps where the second round of selections is made by local experts, specialists from the Zone and National Bal Bhavan. The local resource persons are thoroughly briefed by the National Bal Bhavan before the start of the camps.


=== National Level ===
This is the final level where the qualifying students from different States are provided a common platform to prove their creativity in their respective fields at the 4-days National Level Camp held at National Bal Bhavan. New Delhi. A panel of experts and resource persons drawn from the various streams is identified to administer the tests. In the National Level camp the psychological tests are also conducted by experts. These include verbal tests and tests on creativity. On the basis of these tests and other tools, the children are finally selected.
