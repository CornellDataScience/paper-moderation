Joey Comeau (born September 26, 1980) is a Canadian writer. He wrote the text of the webcomic A Softer World, and authored the novels Lockpick Pornography and Overqualified.


== Career ==
In 2003, Comeau co-created the webcomic A Softer World with Emily Horne. His first novel, Lockpick Pornography, was serialized on the A Softer World site prior to publication in book form by Loose Teeth Press.
Excerpts from his novel Overqualified were included in the 2010 Best American Nonrequired Reading. The first 20 chapters of his novel One Bloody Thing After Another were serialized on the National Post's book blog and the book was nominated for the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award. One Bloody Thing After Another was also nominated for the 2011 ReLit Awards. The Globe and Mail review of One Bloody Thing After Another was generally critical, concluding that the novel did not succeed as either horror or comedy, while the reviewer in the Toronto Star wrote "As a fast-paced, fragmented tale of terror for an accelerated culture, it's bloody good."
In 2012 a sequel to Lockpick Pornography titled We All Got It Coming was released for free on the Internet before being published together with the original in The Complete Lockpick Pornography.
A review of Comeau's 2017 novel Malagash in The Globe and Mail called it "a surprisingly quiet, moody affair", but observed that "some characters and plot lines could be more deeply developed",


=== Kickstarter campaign ===
In 2013, Comeau and collaborator Emily Horne ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to publish the fourth print volume of A Softer World, titled Let's Do Something Wrong. The campaign raised over $78,000, on a goal of $25,000. The project was described as being "A book about dead moms, queers, sexy extremism and sad feelings. In photo comic form with words on the photos, like, over top of them!".


=== Recognition ===
2011 Finalist, Shirley Jackson Award
2017 Anne Green award recipient
2018 American Library Association Alex Award winner
2018 Golden Cowbell Award (Swiss Group of International Schools (SGIS)) for Ninja-rella.
