The temple serves church members in New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado.


== History ==
The intent to build the temple was announced on April 4, 1997, by church president Gordon B. Hinckley during general conference. It is the first temple in the state of New Mexico. Ground was broken to begin construction on June 20, 1998. About 6,500 members attended the event, and it included a 600-voice youth choir.
During a 10-day open house prior to dedication about 70,000 people toured the temple. Church president Hinckley dedicated the temple on March 5, 2000. During the dedicatory prayer, Hinckley expressed his hope that the new temple would turn the hearts of the members of the church to their families.
The temple serves about 55,000 members in New Mexico and bordering parts of Arizona and Colorado. It sits on 8.5 acres (34,000 m2) in northeast Albuquerque. The exterior is finished with desert rose pre-cast concrete and trimmed with Texas pearl granite. A gold statue of the angel Moroni tops the single-spire. The temple has a total of 34,245 square feet (3,181.5 m2), two ordinance rooms, and three sealing rooms.
In 2020, like all others in the church, the Albuquerque New Mexico Temple was closed for a time in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
