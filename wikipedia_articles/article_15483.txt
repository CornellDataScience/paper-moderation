Rhonda Ross Kendrick (born Rhonda Suzanne Silberstein; August 14, 1971) is an American singer and former actress. Kendrick is the daughter of singer and actress Diana Ross and the biological child of Motown Records founder Berry Gordy; however, her legal father is Robert Ellis Silberstein, as her mother was married to him before she was born and he is the father who raised her.


== Early life ==
At the time of Rhonda's birth, Diana Ross was married to her first husband, Robert Ellis Silberstein. Ross, Gordy, and Silberstein all knew of Rhonda's parentage. She was publicly presented as the daughter of Ross and Silberstein, and he raised her. When she was 13, she was told Gordy was her biological father. Ross Kendrick has said that the revelation came as a relief. She was beginning to notice physical differences between herself and her younger sisters. The revelation gave her an answer to the situation. Rhonda Ross Kendrick is the eldest of Diana Ross' five children and the seventh of Berry Gordy's eight biological children. She is a graduate of Brown University.
