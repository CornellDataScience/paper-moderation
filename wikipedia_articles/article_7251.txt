== History ==

The Isaiah Projects was founded in 2022 by Janet Cain (CEO), David Nekrutman (Executive director), Pastor Donna Taylor, and Marsha Conrad with the mission of educating Christians about the Hebraic origins of Christianity. The organization started out by focusing on three main topics; The first is Shabbat (The Sabbath) as a movement, its fulfillment of Messianic Prophecy and how it can be adopted and incorporated into one's life. The second is creating written resources about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. And the third is providing food packages and humanitarian aid to those in need.
In March 2022, the organization's first educational resource, Your Sabbath Invitation, was published.
In April 2023, The Isaiah Projects, together with Shmuel Bowman of Operation Lifeshield, spearheaded a fundraising campaign for the purchase of bomb shelters for kindergartens in the northern Israeli town of Shlomi situated on the border with Lebanon.
In 2023, the organization, together with Pastor Steven Khoury of "Holy Land Missions", led a humanitarian effort to save Dina, a Gazan woman whose husband was murdered over a property dispute. The organization helped to secure safe passage for Dina from Gaza to Bethlehem in the West Bank. When asked about the organization's part in rescuing Dina, CEO Janet Cain replied that care for the widow and the orphan is cemented in biblical scripture. In addition, Executive director, David Nekrutman, stated that "covenant land comes with covenant responsibility" and that helping others is part of the foundations on which he was raised.
