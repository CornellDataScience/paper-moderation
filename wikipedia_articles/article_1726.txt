== St Paul's church ==
St Paul's church stands in an isolated position roughly midway between Holmrook and Santon Bridge. It is part of the benefice of  Eskdale, Irton, Muncaster and Waberthwaite in the Diocese of Carlisle, and services are held twice a month. The Anglo-Saxon Irton Cross stands in its graveyard; there is a reproduction of it in the Cast Courts of the Victoria and Albert Museum, commissioned by the museum in 1882. A plaque by the font is in memorial to Robert Wilfred Skeffington-Lutwidge who was a commissioner in lunacy. The plaque tells the tragic tale of how he died after being hit on the head by a lunatic. The church was rebuilt in 1857 on the site of an earlier church, by Miles Thompson of Kendal (who also designed Arnside Church) and includes glass by Morris & Co.
