The 2021 San Diego Padres season was the 53rd season of the San Diego Padres franchise. The Padres played their home games at Petco Park as members of Major League Baseball's National League West. The Padres entered the 2021 season expecting to contend for the World Series, having made several major acquisitions in the offseason, and held a playoff position in the Wild Card standings from April to late August. The Padres struggled down the stretch after reaching a season high 66-49 record, going 13-34 the rest of the way. The Padres were eliminated from playoff contention on September 25, and finished the 2021 season with a very disappointing record of 79–83.
On April 9, 2021, newly acquired Joe Musgrove pitched a 3–0 no-hitter against the Texas Rangers, the first no-hitter in San Diego Padres history. The no-hitter also broke a streak of having gone 8,205 games without throwing one, a major league record.
