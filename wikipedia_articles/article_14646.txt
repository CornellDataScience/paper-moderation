In December 2019, Sky announced plans to develop Sky Studios Elstree. The facility is being built at Rowley Lane, Borehamwood, located close to the existing Elstree Studios. The new studios are expected to open in 2022, and will provide production space for Sky's original content as well as film and TV productions from NBCUniversal, which is owned by Sky's parent company Comcast.
