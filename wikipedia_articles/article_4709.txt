== Geography ==
The Gore Highway enters the locality from the north (Athol) and exits to the north-west (Southbrook). The Millmerran railway line enters the locality from the east (Wyreema) and exits to the south-west (Southbrook). The locality was served historically by two railway stations, now both abandoned:

Umbiram railway station (27.6628°S 151.7730°E﻿ / -27.6628; 151.7730﻿ (Umbiram railway station (former)))
The Hollows railway station (27.6569°S 151.8013°E﻿ / -27.6569; 151.8013﻿ (The Hollows railway station (former)))
The land use is a mixture of crop growing and grazing on native vegetation.


== History ==
The locality, originally named as Umbirom, takes its name from the railway station name, on the Millmerran railway line, which is an Aboriginal word (possibly from the Gooneburra language) meaning  winding creek.
The locality was given to be established by W. H. Groom (1833–1901), with some confusion involving Messieurs Arthur Hodgson (1818–1902) and Robert Ramsay (1818-1910).
