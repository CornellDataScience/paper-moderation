350 Bay Area is a San Francisco Bay Area regional grassroots climate activism 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. 350 Bay Area is inspired by 350.org, but has no legal connection. 350 Bay Area is associated with several local 350 groups, including 350 San Francisco, 350 East Bay, 350 Contra Costa, 350Marin, 350 Sonoma, Napa Climate NOW! and 350 Silicon Valley. The organization works to eliminate carbon pollution and achieve clean energy and environmental justice.


== History ==
In the summer of 2012 a small group of concerned and dedicated people responded to the need to mobilize millions to insist on real climate action. Inspired by 350.org, which was organizing big marches and rallies, small groups popped up all over the country to support those efforts, including groups in the Bay Area. Leaders from those local groups got together to form 350 Bay Area and 350 Bay Area Action, the sister organization that has fewer restrictions on political activity.


== Mission ==
On its website, the organization states its mission is:

We are building a grassroots climate movement in the Bay Area & beyond to eliminate carbon pollution and achieve a clean energy future with racial, economic, and environmental justice.
