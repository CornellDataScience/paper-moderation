The Millennium Iconoclast Museum of Art (MIMA) is a contemporary art museum in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. It is a privately owned non-profit museum that was founded in 2016. It is located at 41, quai du Hainaut/Henegouwenkaai, along the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, in the former building of the Belle-Vue brewery.


== History ==
Opened on 15 April 2016, the museum is owned by the developer Jean-Paul Pütz. The four-story building was originally built in 1916 and it was once the Belle-Vue brewery. The MIMA was privately financed by Pütz at a cost of €18 million. Seven art collectors have contributed art to the museum. The museum has an operating budget of €600,000 per year.
The two directors are Alice van den Abeele and Raphaël Cruyt. They started the business as a non-profit. They thought the museum was needed because there are no public contemporary art museums in Belgium. The museum has displayed works by Momo and the duo Faile, David Shrigley, and Barry McGee.
The museum is located in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, along the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, at 41, quai du Hainaut/Henegouwenkaai. The area has been considered by some media outlets as a "dangerous place", a reputation the museum seeks to shed. Since 2021, a pedestrian footbridge over the canal offers direct access between the museum and the City of Brussels' side.
