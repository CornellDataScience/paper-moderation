The 2002 Air Canada Cup was Canada's 24th annual national midget 'AAA' hockey championship, played April 22–28, 2002 at the K. C. Irving Regional Centre in Bathurst, New Brunswick.  The Tisdale Trojans from Saskatchewan defeated the Dartmouth Subways from Nova Scotia 6-2 in the gold medal game to win the national title.
This season's Air Canada Cup gained extra attention from media and hockey scouts as 14-year-old prodigy Sidney Crosby competed as a member of the Dartmouth Subways.  He led them to a berth in the championship game, the first time that a team from Atlantic Canada had ever advanced to the gold medal game.  Crosby led the round robin in scoring with 18 points in five games and was named the Most Valuable Player.  Other notable players competing at the 2002 Air Canada Cup were Olivier Latendresse, Guillaume Latendresse, Andrew Gordon, Shaun Heshka, Tyson Strachan, Jay Rosehill, and Torrey Mitchell.
