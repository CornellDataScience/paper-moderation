The Yavapai–Apache Nation (Yavapai: Wipuhk’a’bah  and Western Apache: Dil’zhe’e) is a federally recognized Native American tribe of Yavapai people in the Verde Valley of Arizona. Tribal members share two culturally distinct backgrounds and speak two Indigenous languages, the Yavapai language and the Western Apache language.


== History ==
The Yavapai–Apache have lived in the American Southwest since 1100 CE. Their traditional ecological knowledge allowed them to flourish as hunter-gatherers. Chief Yuma Frank, Chief Viola Jimulla, and Carlos Montezuma were some of the first leaders of the Yavapai-Apache Nation. Beginning in 1865, the Yavapai were relocated to several reservations: Colorado River, Fort McDowell, Rio Verde, San Carlos, Camp Verde, Middle Verde, Clarkdale, and Prescott.


== Government ==

The Yavapai–Apache government has three branches: Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary. The Executive branch consists of the Chairperson, Vice Chairperson, Council Secretary, and Council Treasurer, who oversees the administration of tribal business. The Legislative branch is the Tribal Council, which has nine members, including the Chairperson and the Vice Chairperson. The Council's powers include developing laws, codes, and ordinances and representing the Yavapai-Apache people in all matters concerning their health and welfare. The tribal membership elects the Council, which consists of the Chairperson, Vice Chairperson, and seven other Tribal Council members. The Judicial Branch consists of a Trible Court, a Court of Appeals, and other lower courts considered necessary by the Tribal Council. The judiciary interprets and applies the laws of the Nation and resolves legal matters.
In 2024, Tanya Lewis serves as the Chairwoman and Ricardo Pacheco is the Vice Chairman.
