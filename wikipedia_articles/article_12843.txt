As a junior in 2011, Smith ran for 118 yards against Eastern Michigan on September 17, the second 100-yard rushing game of his collegiate career.  After the Eastern Michigan game, head coach Brady Hoke named Smith as the Wolverines starting running back, adding that Smith had "earned that right."  Against Minnesota on October 1, 2011, Smith became the first football player in Michigan history to score rushing, passing and receiving touchdowns in the same game.  He was the first Division I FBS player to accomplish the feat since 2009.  Smith's touchdown pass came on a 17-yard throw to sophomore receiver Drew Dileo.

Through the first 11 games of the 2012 season, Smith gained 88 rushing yards and scored three touchdowns. Jadeveon Clowney's tackle of Smith in the 2013 Outback Bowl, which resulted in a fumble and sent Smith's helmet flying five yards downfield, became an Internet sensation as it was one of the most brutal hits of all time.  Smith said of the hit: "I couldn't duck or try anything.  My head wasn't even down and that's why my helmet popped off."
