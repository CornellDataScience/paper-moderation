Huawei AppGallery was launched in 2011 in China and in 2018 internationally.
In May 2019, Huawei was added to the Entity List by the US Department of Commerce, effectively banning the company's software products from gaining access to Google Mobile Services (GMS), Google Play Store and other such applications. As a result, Huawei began releasing its new devices with its own AppGallery, in which the apps were programmed with its own proprietary Huawei Mobile Services (HMS).
On 9 August 2019, soon after the US ban, Huawei launched HarmonyOS, first on smart TVs for Honor Vision and Vision S. In 2019 there were 45,000 Android apps using HMS on AppGallery.

About a week later, Huawei launched a separate HarmonyOS section on its AppGallery to recommend HarmonyOS apps and compatible Android apps. Apps specifically made for HarmonyOS carried a small "HMOS" badge in the right hand corner of the app icon.
