The Hornbostel-Sachs system of musical instrument classification defines chordophones as all instruments in which sound is primarily produced by the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points. This group includes all instruments generally called string instruments (list) in the west, as well as many (but not all) keyboard instruments, such as pianos and harpsichords.


== Chordophones (3) ==


=== Simple chordophones or zithers (31) ===

Instruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer. These instruments may have a resonator box, but removing it should not render the instrument unplayable (although it may result in quite a different sound being produced). They include the piano therefore, as well as other kinds of zithers such as the koto, and musical bows.


==== Bar zithers (311) ====
The string bearer is bar shaped.
311.1 Musical bows - The string bearer is flexible (and curved).
311.11 Idiochord musical bows - The string is cut from the bark of the cane, remaining attached at each end.
311.111 Mono-idiochord musical bows - Containing one string only
311.112 Poly-idiochord musical bows or harp-bows - Containing several strings that pass over some type of bridge.
311.12 Heterochord musical bows - The string is of separate material from the bearer.
311.121 Mono-heterochord musical bows - The bow has one heterochord string only.
311.121.1 Without resonator.
311.121.11 Without tuning noose.
311.121.12 With tuning noose.
311.121.2 With resonator.
311.121.21 With independent resonator.
311.121.22 With resonator attached.
311.121.221 Without tuning noose.
311.121.222 With tuning noose.
311.122 Poly-heterochord musical bows - The bow has several heterochord strings.
311.122.1 Without tuning noose.
311.122.2 With tuning noose.
311.2 Stick zithers - With rigid string carrier
311.21 Musical bow/stick - The string carrier has one rigid and one flexible end.
311.211 Instrument has one resonator gourd
311.22 True stick zithers - Round sticks which happen to be hollow by chance do not belong on this account to the tube zithers, but are round-bar zithers; however, instruments in which a tubular cavity is employed as a true resonator, like the modern Mexican harpa, are tube zithers.

==== Frame zithers (316) ====
The strings are stretched across an open frame
316.1 Without resonator.
316.2 With resonator.


=== Composite chordophones (32) ===

Acoustic and electro-acoustic instruments which have a resonator as an integral part of the instrument, and solid-body electric chordophones. The resonators and string bearers of these instruments are physically united, and they cannot be separated without destroying the instrument. This includes most western string instruments, including lutes such as violins and guitars, and harps.


==== Lutes (321) ====
The plane of the strings runs parallel with the resonator's surface.
321.1 Bow lutes - Each string has its own flexible carrier.
321.2 Yoke lutes or lyres - The strings are attached to a yoke which lies in the same plane as the sound-table and consists of two arms and a cross-bar.
321.21 Bowl lyres.
321.22 Box lyres.
321.3 Handle lutes - The string bearer is a plain handle.
