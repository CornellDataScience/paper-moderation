Earl of Eglinton is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created by James IV of Scotland in 1507 for Hugh Montgomerie, 3rd Lord Montgomerie.
In 1859, the thirteenth Earl of Eglinton, Archibald Montgomerie, was also created Earl of Winton in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords, and both earldoms have been united since. Furthermore, other titles held with the earldoms are: Lord Montgomerie (created 1449), Baron Ardrossan (1806) and Baron Seton and Tranent (1859). The first is in the Peerage of Scotland, while the latter two are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.
William Dunbar mentions a Sir Hugh of Eglinton in his Lament for the Makaris, citing him as a fellow poet. He has sometimes been tentatively identified as Huchown, but this is not certain.
The Earl of Eglinton is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Montgomery. The ancestral seat was Eglinton Castle in Kilwinning, North Ayrshire.
