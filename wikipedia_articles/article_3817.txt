Jean (Baptiste) Cappus (Dijon, 6 October 1689 – 10 March 1751) was a French composer. The second name ‘Baptiste’ is attested only on his 1730 book of viol music.


== Biography ==
Youngest son of François Cappus, organist, singer and composer in Dijon, and  Anne Hervelin, Jean Cappus married Marie-Michelle Dotée on 17 October 1729. The couple had two sons, Louis and Nicolas.


== Career ==
In 1734 Jean Cappus become director of the theatre in Dijon. He was  ‘Pensionnaire de la Ville de Dijon’ (resident (artist) for the city of
Dijon), ‘Maître Ordinaire de la Ville de Dijon’ (Ordinary Master for the city
of Dijon), and  musician for Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, prince of Condé (dit Louis IV, ou M. le Duc), governor of Burgundy (1710-1740). He also worked regularly   as a composer for the Jesuit College in Dijon for whom he composed music  for plays; only the text has survived, not the music. Jean Cappus rented the Hôtel de Barres in Dijon in 1734, which nowadays is the square Carrelet de Loizy. Here he directed many productions up to his death. An account of his conducting was given by Lantin Damerey in 1838 : ‘Rameau played the harpsichord, and Cappus directed the
orchestra with such vanity equal to a general of the army at the head of his
troops. His wife took over when it was needed’.
