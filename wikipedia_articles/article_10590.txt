== History ==
On April 4, 1975, a U.S. jet, while taking off from Saigon, crashed into a jungle outside of Tan Son Nhut. The jet carried 242 Vietnamese orphans bound for adoption in the U.S. The accident caused the death of a third of the children, and those who survived were critically injured and were waiting to be rescued. The Pentagon announced that it could not get assistance and resources to the crash site for at least 11 days.
Robert Macauley, who was an executive in the paper industry (Virginia Fibre Corporation), arranged to have a Pan American Airlines 747 rescue the children. The children were rescued and flown to San Francisco within 48 hours. The jet cost $251,000. Macauley mortgaged his house to cover the expense. Macauley was educated at Greenwich Country Day School, Andover Phillips Academy, and Yale University, where he studied international affairs. He has a large desire to help people who are in need.
In 1981, Pope John Paul II asked Macauley to raise funds that would provide medicine, clothing and other supplies for people suffering under martial law in Poland. In March 1982, the first airlift delivered $2.4 million worth of medicine and supplies to Poland. This marked the first official mission of the organization.
Macauley served as the CEO of AmeriCares from 1979 to 2002, and chairman of the board until his death caused by emphysema in 2010. He originally founded AmeriCares in New Canaan, Connecticut in 1979. It was then relocated to its current headquarters location in Stamford, Connecticut. During 1993, AmeriCares was rated "the Best Charity in America" by Money. The organization has always been rooted in strong partnerships, effective fundraising, and the dedication of volunteers.


== Current leadership ==
Michael J. Nyenhuis has served as CEO of AmeriCares from 2014 until March 14, 2020. His salary is reported at approximately $500,000.
AmeriCares recently announced that former executive vice president and chief development officer Christine Squires has superseded Nyenhuis as CEO of the AmeriCares Foundation. As the new CEO of AmeriCares, Squires will have the responsibility of overseeing all of AmeriCares' global operations. Nyenhuis is reported to have become CEO of UNICEF USA.
Prior to joining AmeriCares in 2016, Squires served as a chief operating officer for Physicians for Human Rights, where she oversaw the organization's global development and strategic planning efforts. Squires also headed up growth and fundraising for Human Rights Watch and spent 10 years at the United States Fund for UNICEF. She holds a bachelor's degree in English from the University of Delaware and is a graduate of the Center for Creative Leadership's Executive Development Program.
Jerry Leamon has served as the chairman of the board of AmeriCares Foundation. Leamon joined the AmeriCares board in 2005 and was elected chairman in 2015. He retired from the Deloitte network in 2012 as global managing director responsible for client and market-facing programs.


== Emergency response ==
AmeriCares organizes emergency response teams to deliver urgently needed aid to survivors of disasters. Such aid includes medicines, medical supplies, water or water purification treatments, and other critically needed resources. In 2012, AmeriCares responded to 24 emergencies in 18 countries.
Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, AmeriCares delivered emergency supplies for more than 400,000 people in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York, including blankets, flashlights, bottled water, and first aid kits. AmeriCares continued to provide post-emergency relief with the AmeriCares mobile medical clinic used to assist health care facilities unable to treat patients because of storm damage and power outages.
AmeriCares sent $6 million in medical aid immediately after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Among prominent donors, actress Jennifer Aniston supported the organization's work in Haiti with a benefit screening.  Since then, the organization has given the country more than $60 million in aid for vaccinations, maternal health, cholera prevention and health workers training.
In response to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, AmeriCares sent close to $6 million in medical supplies and humanitarian aid. The recovery work in Japan included restoring medical and dental clinics and psychosocial programs for survivors. Since then most of these programs have found to be successful. The medical and dental clinics are all back and in good standing form. On top of that many survivors did reach out for psychological assistance and have been treated.
In 2020 there was a quick and needed response from AmeriCares due to the coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic is a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. AmeriCares has a long history of responding to infectious disease outbreaks, including cholera, ebola, dengue, and Zika outbreaks. AmeriCares is delivering more than 1.4 million protective masks for health workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The masks will help to alleviate shortages at hospitals and primary care facilities in 11 states and Puerto Rico. This ongoing effort, along with monetary funds, is being contributed in relief of this pandemic.
