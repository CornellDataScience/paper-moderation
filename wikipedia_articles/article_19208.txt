King Woman released their first successful EP, Doubt, with The Flenser in 2015. The EP was inspired by Esfandiari's experiences of trying to leave her religious upbringing.
King Woman signed to Relapse Records and released their debut LP, Created in the Image of Suffering, which was labelled by Pitchfork as one of the best rock albums of 2017. Writing for Beats Per Minuteâ€™s "Darkest Albums" feature, John Amen called the album "a disturbing journey through consternation, despair, and heretical inquiry." King Woman's second album, Celestial Blues, was announced in June 2021, as was its July 2021 oncoming release by Relapse Records. The first single from the album, "Morning Star", was released ahead of the LP. This was followed by a second single, "Psychic Wound", and a third single, "Boghz".

The album quickly became a fan favourite and her breakthrough record, according to most mainstream media. Pitchfork and Spin praised her work. She later toured extensively in the US.
