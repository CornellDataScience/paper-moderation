== Background ==
During the songwriting process, "I'm Not Alright" was originally planned to be titled "I'll Be Fine" when it was a demo. Sanctus Real lead vocalist Matt Hammit said in an interview: "This song definitely led the way for the honesty that was expressed on this record [The Face of Love] ... We went into the studio with this "I'll Be Fine" song, and we just weren't having it. We were lying to ourselves even trying to write a song like that." In April 2005, during a studio recording session, producer Christopher Stevens was playing chords they had planned for the track. The band decided to rework the lyrics to portray a different theme: "You know what? I'm not all right. ... We're not going to lie. We're not going to try to sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good", Hammit said. "[We] went over it and ended up with 'I'm Not Alright', which was a true confession of how we were feeling and gave us a little of the freedom and emotional release to be honest and vulnerable."
