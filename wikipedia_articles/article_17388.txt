== Production ==
The film was first announced in January when it was revealed that Murugadoss's brother Dileepan would make his debut as an actor in a venture to be co-produced by Fox Star Studios. Murugadoss chose the film's title as Vathikuchi, in reference to the song "Vathikuchi Pathikadhuda" from his directorial debut Dheena (2001).
After winning accolades for her performance in Engaeyum Eppothum, Anjali was signed up by Murugadoss as the lead actress.


== Soundtrack ==
The film's score and soundtrack are composed by Ghibran. The soundtrack was released on 13 February 2013.


== Marketing and release ==
Because the lead character is an auto rickshaw driver, the makers of Vathikuchi promoted the film through auto rickshaws. At least four or five branded auto rickshaws would travel through Madurai, Tiruchirappalli and Coimbatore for promoting the film. Vathikuchi was released on 15 March 2013.


== Critical reception ==
Vivek Ramz from in.com rated it 3 out of 5 and stated that Vathikuchi is more brawny than brainy. He added that Director Kinslin shows promise in his debut film with different treatment for this somewhat clichéd story. His way of storytelling is realistic at times with very grounded level approach towards a common man issue. The problem with the film is that he has introduced too many characters and made few simple situations more complex which works at times and at other times backfired. Finally concluding that it's not a bad film at all and can be watched once! Karthik Subramanian of The Hindu wrote that the film "is not so much bad in the way it is executed but the story just gets progressively mind-numbingly stupid".
