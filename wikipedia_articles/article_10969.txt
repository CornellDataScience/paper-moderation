Originally hailing from Vancouver, British Columbia, Shaw's first experiences with music started from a young age, learning the violin and branching out to other contemporary musical instruments as he grew up. He would initially gain recognition in the music industry as the bassist for Vancouver-based indie rock band, Said the Whale which he joined in 2011. Concurrently in-between touring, Shaw also began to learn music production and started creating sample-based instrumentals, as he didn't feel confident enough to perform vocals on his own material. He quickly broke into the local underground music scene as a DJ and would become a member of Vancouver electronic music collective, Chapel Sound. On November 20, 2013, Shaw released his debut single, "Unfaith" via SoundCloud.
