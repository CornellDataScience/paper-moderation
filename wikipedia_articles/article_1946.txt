Guido Basso  (27 September 1937 – 13 February 2023) was a Canadian jazz musician who was a member of Rob McConnell's Boss Brass big band. He was a trumpeter, flugelhornist, arranger, composer, and conductor.


== Early life ==
Guido Basso was born in Montreal, Quebec, on 27 September 1937. He grew up in the Little Italy neighbourhood of Montreal, in an Italian-Canadian family. He began playing the trumpet at the age of nine. He studied at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal. His professional music career started in his teens, under the name "Stubby Basso".
During his early-20s, Basso performed regularly at the El Morocco in Montreal, and played in bands led by Maury Kaye. Singer Vic Damone discovered Basso playing at the El Morocco, then included him on a tour from 1957 to 1958.


== Career ==
Basso had a professional career as a composer, conductor, arranger, trumpeter, flugelhornist, and harmonica player. The Canadian Encyclopedia wrote that Basso was "one of Canada's pre-eminent jazz trumpeters", and that "he was credited with the theory that one attacks the trumpet and makes love to a flugelhorn".
In 1958, he joined singer Pearl Bailey and her husband, drummer Louis Bellson, touring North America with them and their orchestra. Basso returned to Canada and settled in Toronto in 1961, instead of obtaining permanent residency in the United States and the likelihood of required enlistment in the United States Army. Basso then studied at The Royal Conservatory of Music during the early 1960s.
In 1963, he became music director for CBLT's Nightcap, a job he held until 1967. He subsequently held a number of music director positions with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), as well as being active as a performer. His work at CBC included Barris and Company (1968–69), Mallets and Brass (1969) with vibraphonist Peter Appleyard, music director of After Noon (1969–1971), and leading orchestras playing big band music on 'In the Mood (1971–72) and Bandwagon (1972–73).

He organized and led big band concerts at the CNE Bandshell, featuring Dizzy Gillespie, Quincy Jones, Woody Herman, Benny Goodman, Count Basie and Duke Ellington. Basso was a charter member of Rob McConnell's Boss Brass, playing with the band for over twenty years. Basso also played in big bands led by Ron Collier, and Phil Nimmons.


== Personal life ==
Basso was married to Kristin, and had one daughter, Mia Basso Noble, who was a musician and songwriter. Mia died of cancer in September 2013.
Basso died in Toronto, on 13 February 2023, at age 85.


== Awards and honours ==
Basso was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1994. His citation cited him as, "an advocate of the arts and an inspiration to young musicians, he is generous with his time and talent, running workshops and clinics, and lending his name and expertise to worthy causes". He received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.
Basso won the Juno Award for traditional jazz album of the year, Turn Out the Stars, in 2003. and a second Juno Award for traditional jazz album of the year, Lost in the Stars, in 2004.
