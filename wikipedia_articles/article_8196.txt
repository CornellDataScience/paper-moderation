=== Notes ===
1 Although he did not buy a unit, Barry ended up spending $500 after he bought a set of tools and sirens for an Indian motorcycle from Brandi and Jarrod.
2 Dave did not attend the main auction in Montebello, but instead purchased a unit in Costa Mesa at a different self-storage facility.
3 Dave did not attend the main auction in Westminster, but instead purchased a unit in Fontana at a different self-storage facility.
4 This unit was purchased by Darrell's son Brandon Sheets.
5 Barry only made $350 on the unit, but he made a further $5,000 on a bet with Dave over the age of a vintage sofa, a bet which Barry won.
6 Since Dave had a broken axle on his trailer because a wheel came off, the profit of his locker decreased by $500 so he could pay for repairs and pulled Brandi and Jarrod's over as a prank.
7 Although Barry bought a unit at the auction for $875, he spent another $800 on an antique box and some Halloween decorations that he bought from Brandi and Jarrod as they were going through their unit.
