== Personal life ==
Ivan was born on 20 August 2002 in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Both his father and brother played hockey. He told ColoradoEagles.com the origin of his name: "My dad's name is Marek, and his last name is Ivan. Since Marek and Ivan are both first names, people were always wondering whether his name was Marek or Ivan, so he made it easier for me. I like it and it’s special because there are not many people with my name." He grew up an Avalanche fan in Czechia after playing as them on a PlayStation hockey video game.
