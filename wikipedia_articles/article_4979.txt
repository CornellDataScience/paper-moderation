== History ==
In his chronicle, Hertzog describes Balbronn as a Staettlin (small town). The church is very old. Inside it is a headstone from 1574 containing the remains of Jean de Mittelhausen and his wife Barbe Hufel.
In the forests in the west of Balbronn there was once a village called Elbersforst which was in a large clearing in the forest where there is now the Auberge d'Elemerforst. A plaque indicates that the place is the property of the Notre Dame works. Stones from the old village can still be seen above the restaurant patio. These are the old foundations of several buildings of what was formerly called Elbersforst. Since 2007 this medieval town has been the subject of archaeological excavations. Elbersforst was part of Westhoffen which depended on Marmourtier Abbey.
