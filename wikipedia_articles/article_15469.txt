In mathematics, a Banach manifold is a manifold modeled on Banach spaces. Thus it is a topological space in which each point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to an open set in a Banach space (a more involved and formal definition is given below). Banach manifolds are one possibility of extending manifolds to infinite dimensions.
A further generalisation is to Fréchet manifolds, replacing Banach spaces by Fréchet spaces. On the other hand, a Hilbert manifold is a special case of a Banach manifold in which the manifold is locally modeled on Hilbert spaces.

 exists and is a continuous function with respect to the

-norm topology on subsets of

One can then show that there is a unique topology on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 such that each 
  
    
      
        
          U
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U_{i}}
  
 is open and each 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}}
  
 is a homeomorphism. Very often, this topological space is assumed to be a Hausdorff space, but this is not necessary from the point of view of the formal definition.
If all the Banach spaces 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{i}}
  
 are equal to the same space 
  
    
      
        E
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle E,}
  
 the atlas is called an 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
-atlas. However, it is not a priori necessary that the Banach spaces 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{i}}

        E

A new chart

    {\displaystyle (U,\varphi )}
  
 is called compatible with a given atlas 
  
    
      
        
          {

            :
            i
            ∈

is an 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  
-times continuously differentiable function for every

 Two atlases are called compatible if every chart in one is compatible with the other atlas. Compatibility defines an equivalence relation on the class of all possible atlases on 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
  

A 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle C^{r}}
  
-manifold structure on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 is then defined to be a choice of equivalence class of atlases on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 of class 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            r
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle C^{r}.}
  
 If all the Banach spaces 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{i}}
  
 are isomorphic as topological vector spaces (which is guaranteed to be the case if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 is connected), then an equivalent atlas can be found for which they are all equal to some Banach space 
  
    
      
        E
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle E.}
  
 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 is then called an 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
-manifold, or one says that 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 is modeled on 
  
    
      
        E
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle E.}
  


== Examples ==
Every Banach space can be canonically identified as a Banach manifold. If 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        ,
        ‖
        
        ⋅
        
        ‖
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X,\|\,\cdot \,\|)}
  
 is a Banach space, then 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 is a Banach manifold with an atlas containing a single, globally-defined chart (the identity map). 
Similarly, if 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
  
 is an open subset of some Banach space then 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
  
 is a Banach manifold.  (See the classification theorem below.)


== Classification up to homeomorphism ==
It is by no means true that a finite-dimensional manifold of dimension 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
 is globally homeomorphic to 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},}
  
 or even an open subset of 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.}
  
 However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, it is possible to classify "well-behaved" Banach manifolds up to homeomorphism quite nicely. A 1969 theorem of David Henderson states that every infinite-dimensional, separable, metric Banach manifold 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 can be embedded as an open subset of the infinite-dimensional, separable Hilbert space, 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  
 (up to linear isomorphism, there is only one such space, usually identified with 
  
    
      
        
          ℓ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}}
  
). In fact, Henderson's result is stronger: the same conclusion holds for any metric manifold modeled on a separable infinite-dimensional Fréchet space.
The embedding homeomorphism can be used as a global chart for 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
  
 Thus, in the infinite-dimensional, separable, metric case, the "only" Banach manifolds are the open subsets of Hilbert space.
