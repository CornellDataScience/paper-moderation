This radical character takes different forms in different languages and characters.
In traditional typefaces, regardless of the position of the radical character, the two turning strokes are broken into two respectively to adapt to the carving of movable type systems, and there is usually a gap between the second and the third strokes, and the middle stroke of the last three strokes is a vertical line and is written prior to the rest two strokes (middle-left-right). In actual handwriting, however, when the radical character is used as a left component, the last three strokes are more often written as dots from left to right (糹) rather than middle-left-right, especially in regular script. 
Currently, when used independently or as a bottom component (as in 索, 繁, etc.), the discontinuous turning strokes are merged into one, and a hook is added to the end of the vertical line to imitate the character's handwriting form in both printed Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese. When used as a left component, it is simplified as 纟 in Simplified Chinese, which is derived from the cursive form of 糹. The standard printing form of the traditional left component form 糹 is also altered to imitate the handwriting form, and the last three strokes are also written left-to-right. In addition, in mainland China's Guo Biao traditional Chinese characters, the first dot in the last three strokes of 糹 tilts to the left, while in Taiwan's Standard Form of National Characters, all three dots are written rightward. The more traditional typeface form 糸 is still widely used in Traditional Chinese publication
The traditional form remains standard in modern Japanese and Korean printing typefaces, while in handwriting, both forms are acceptable.
