Live in Hollywood is the second live album by Mexican pop band RBD, released on April 4, 2006, in the United States and Mexico. Live in Hollywood was recorded on RBD's first concert in Los Angeles, California on January 21, 2006, at the Pantages Theatre, as part of the group's 'Tour Generación 2006' world tour. The live album was accompanied by the same-day release of a live concert DVD, also titled Live in Hollywood. The acoustic music that appears on the album was recorded live, though in a way posing a different style to the group's previous Tour Generación RBD En Vivo.
On April 19, 2006, the first single off the album was released, a new song titled "No Pares", which was sung solely by Dulce María. The song proved to be a total success on Mexican radio. The song was written by former Mexican pop star Lynda Thomas and producer Carlos Lara.


== Background and release ==

The live album was recorded on January 21, 2006, at the show performed in the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles, California, which was part of RBD's second concert tour, titled 'Tour Generación 2006' or 'Nuestro Amor Tour'. The concert was the first the band performed in the United States. The show itself had a visually colorful and acoustic style, even counting with the support of a gospel choir.
One of the members of RBD, Christian Chávez, explained during an interview that the songs recorded belonged to the Nuestro Amor album, the difference being that this time the songs were acoustic, and added: "There are many instruments, strings, percussions, and the finished product is something very cool, more intimate".
The album was simultaneously put on sale on April 4, 2006, in Mexico, Brazil, and the United States. The live concert DVD recorded on January 21, 2006, was also released the same day. In Spain, the live album was released on December 11, 2006. The release is mostly composed of the songs included in RBD's second studio album, Nuestro Amor.
