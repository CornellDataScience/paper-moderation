The On The Road Again Tour was the fourth headlining concert tour, and second all-stadium tour, by English-Irish boy band One Direction, in support of their fourth studio album Four. The tour began on 7 February 2015 in Sydney, Australia and ended on 31 October 2015 in Sheffield, England. The tour grossed $208 million from 77 shows, selling over 2.3 million tickets. It became the second highest-grossing concert tour of 2015, only behind Taylor Swift's The 1989 World Tour. This concert is also notable for the final tour with member Liam Payne before his death in 2024.
Less than two months into the tour, Zayn Malik left the band. His last performance with the group was in Hong Kong, on 18 March, while he gave his departure announcement publicly during the band's show in Indonesia on 25 March. The group then continued touring as a foursome, and began recording new material that was released in the latter half of that year. This was also One Direction's last tour before a hiatus began in 2016.


== Background ==
The tour was announced on the Australian breakfast television program Today on 18 May 2014. The group made their debut performance in some countries on this tour. On 19 January 2015, it was announced that Australian pop singer Samantha Jade would be the opening act for the Australian shows, alongside McBusted.

On 19 March 2015, Zayn Malik announced his decision to exit the tour, citing "stress". Six days later, on 25 March, the band announced Malik's decision to permanently exit the group, citing his desire to live a "normal 22-year old life" and that the remaining members would continue as a four-piece group. In a statement, they said: We're really sad to see Zayn go, but we totally respect his decision and send him all our love for the future. The past five years have been beyond amazing, we've gone through so much together, so we will always be friends. The four of us will now continue. We're looking forward to recording the new album and seeing all the fans on the next stage of the world tour.
On 1 June 2015, the North American leg was officially announced as a part of 14th Annual Honda Civic Tours.
