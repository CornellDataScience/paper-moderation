Men's college basketball in the Pac-12 Conference began in 1915 with the formation of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). Principal members of the PCC founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959, and subsequently went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, and Pacific-10, becoming the Pac-12 in 2011. The Pac-12 includes the PCC as part of its history despite the two leagues being formed under separate charters. Competing in the Pac-12 are the Arizona Wildcats, Arizona State Sun Devils, California Golden Bears, Colorado Buffaloes, Oregon Ducks, Oregon State Beavers, Stanford Cardinal, UCLA Bruins, USC Trojans, Utah Utes, Washington Huskies, and Washington State Cougars.
All members of the Pac-12 are scheduled to join other conferences after the 2023–24 season. Oregon, UCLA, USC, and Washington will leave for the Big Ten Conference; Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah will join the Big 12 Conference; California and Stanford will join the Atlantic Coast Conference, and Oregon State and Washington State will join the West Coast Conference.
As of 2023, Pac-12 schools have won 15 Division I national titles. This was tied with the Atlantic Coast Conference for the most of any conference.  Oregon won the first NCAA tournament in 1939. UCLA has won 11 national titles, the most of any Division I team.  Arizona has won the most recent national title, winning in 1997.  Stanford in 1942, Utah in 1944 and California in 1959 are the other NCAA champions.
