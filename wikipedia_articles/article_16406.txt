Rocky & the Chapter are an American rock band from New Jersey.


== History ==
Vocalist and guitarist Rocky Catanese grew up in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and played in the band Let Me Run. After Let Me Run disbanded in 2013, Catanese began working on songs for a solo project, however he soon was collaborating with former bandmate and drummer Trevor Reddell. Shortly after, bassist Matt Balog, and guitarists Chris Grzan and Joe Lanza joined the band, which was named Rocky & the Chapter. The band cites musical influence from Ryan Adams, Counting Crows, Jawbox, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Tegan and Sara, and they draw comparison to the music of Motion City Soundtrack, Jimmy Eat World, and the Gaslight Anthem. On their live performances, Jim Testa calls Rocky & the Chapter "a muscular example of Hub City rock," and Speak Into My Good Eye editor Phil Shepard says "I get the hype[,] these guys bring it with great energy and feeling."
