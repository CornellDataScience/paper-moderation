The 2021 PGCBL season is the tenth season of the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League, a wood bat collegiate summer baseball league. The league's first since the 2019 season after the 2020 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The league split into three divisions of East, Central, and West of five, four (five including Adirondack), and six teams respectively. The league added the Batavia Muckdogs, Auburn Doubledays, and Niagara Power during the off-season. However the day prior to the regular season beginning, due to COVID-19 complications the Adirondack Trail Blazers canceled their season. Thus lowering the league to 15 teams for the season and the Central division from five teams to four. Also, the Jamestown Jammers officially rebranded as the Jamestown Tarp Skunks starting in the 2021 season. While there was supposed to be 48 games for every team in the league, not all of them were played due to rainouts or cancellations.
