The European Parliament Intergroup on LGBTI Rights is an intergroup of the European Parliament's legislators which focuses on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons both inside and outside the European Union. It is a cross-party group of Members of the European Parliament counting over 150 supporters from five political groups and all EU countries. The LGBTI Intergroup remains the largest in the 2019 to 2024 legislature.
The Intergroup collaborates with EU institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, EEAS, European Committee of the Regions, Fundamental Rights Agency), Permanent Representations of Member States, other European International Organisations (e.g. Council of Europe, United Nations) and civil society associations (LGBTI-specific associations such as ILGA-Europe, IGLYO, Transgender Europe, NELFA, or with broader human rights focuses like Front Line Defenders, Civil Rights Defenders and Amnesty International).
