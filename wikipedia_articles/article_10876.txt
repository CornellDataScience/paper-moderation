Grenier continued his development, becoming one of the club's best prospects.

Despite the interest, Grenier along with fellow youth player Yannis Tafer, signed his first professional contract on 15 May 2008, agreeing to a three-year deal.
Though Grenier was on the senior team and featured in several pre-season matches ahead of the 2008–09 season, he spent the majority of the campaign playing with the reserve team in the Championnat de France Amateur, the fourth division of French football. Grenier played in 16 league matches and scored his only goal against Agde.
