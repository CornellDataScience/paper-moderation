Janko Kroner (born 1 June 1956) is a Slovak film, television and stage actor. Once a regular cast of the Slovak National Theater (SND) (1987–2009), Kroner began his acting career as part of the New Scene (1982–86). In the mid 1990s, alongside staging for his home theater, he gradually began appearing in a local VA-based ensemble called a.ha. In the most recent decade, he has been known as the frontman of the Malá scéna STU, a body supervised by Kroner through 2010-2011.
As a member of the Slovak acting "dynasty" that span three generations to date, Kroner himself has received numerous nominations in his native country, including two LitFond Awards for Performing Arts in Drama, as well two television-focused OTO Awards as TV Male Actor, respectively. Amongst others, he is the only son of Ján Kroner, or rather a nephew of Jozef Kroner.


== Filmography ==
I was a first-year student on elementary school in Považská Bystrica, when amateur actors came to our school to play The Salt Prince fairytale. My father played the King. He was very funny, I remember [that] all children would have a good laugh of him. So I'd wished for all the children to know [that] the King was my father. No one would believe me, though, and I felt too badly for that."
