The Tiger Claw Tree
The Tiger Claw Tree follows the vicissitudes of a Tenkalai Iyengar family in South India. At its center is the matriarch Ponna who is taking her last stand both against death and her failing memory. Her confused memories about long forgotten family anecdotes are both family history and impetus for events in the personal history of her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. The last of these are Kannan and Nambi who bring the story into the latter half of the last century and whose personal tragedies are set against the larger canvas of regional and national histories. Although an engaging family saga it rises above that genre by exploring the validity of ideas and their personal betrayal against the tragic backdrop of the nightmare that is History. The title is drawn from a A.K.Ramanujan translation of a famous Sangam poem from the anthology Ainkurunuru (Poem 142). Author adds a pithy coda to this little gem of a poem: "Each person has a tree within himself, to some the birds may not come at all."

The Muddy river
Krishnan's second novel Muddy River drops the grand raconteurial ambition of narrating stories spanning a century and instead chooses to focus on one man's story against the backdrop of Indian bureaucracy and modern day politics. Drawn largely from his personal experience as an Executive Director of Vigilance in a public sector company, the novel follows Ramesh Chandran in his quest to rescue a kidnapped Engineer from the hands of Assamese Militants. The novel adopts a more complicated narrative strategy than Tiger Claw as it tracks in parallel the authorial ambitions of Ramesh Chandran as he attempts to weave his own life story that is part adventure, part bureaucratic nightmare and part personal tragedy into a complex novel. Self-referential and ambitious Muddy River attempts to blur the lines between fiction and reality, between narrator and the narration in the hope that these erasures will bring forth a more meaningful reality for its present and future readers.
