== Style ==
Kui's style is noted for its portrayal of reality and fantasy with her unique point of view. Megumi Sakamoto writing for Comic Natalie described her characteristic style as embodying "unnaturalness" (違和感). Kui was noted in an interview with Comic Natalie to have an affinity with dragons, and has had dragons featured in several of her works.
Prior to Delicious in Dungeon, Kui read The Neverending Story and The Lord of the Rings, as well as researching the rulebooks of Dungeons & Dragons after having seen it arise several times for her research prior to the manga's serialization. Kui is a noted fan of computer role-playing games, having previously drawn fan art for Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, Baldur's Gate 3, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, and Planescape: Torment. As a child, she observed her father play Wizardry on the Famicom, as well as Dragon Quest, Ultima, and Fire Emblem. Kui cited Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge as one of the primary inspirations for Delicious in Dungeon.
