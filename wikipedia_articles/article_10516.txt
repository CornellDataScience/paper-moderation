== Plot ==
The film tells of Juan Desouza, a lawyer in his late 40s, who's happily married and his wife is expecting a child.
On a one-day business trip to the country-side, Desouza embarks on an unintended journey.  When he reaches his destination Desouza discovers that the man traveling next to him is not sleeping but dead.
Secretly, he assumes the dead man's identity and invents a profession for himself.  He finds a place to stay in the village where the man used to live and contemplates not returning.
Juan Desouza undertakes an adventure into nature, into the rediscovery of his tastes and his basic instincts.  He tries to grasp the idea that the life dealt out for him, and which he chose to live, is not the only one possible.
He eventually goes back home, stronger from the spiritual experience.

== Reception ==


=== Critical response ===
The film was well received at the Berlin International Film Festival winning a Jury Grand Prix Silver Bear.
Film critic Annika Pham, who writes for Cineuropa, liked the film, and wrote, "The film subtly explores the apprehension of death as well as the palpable yet invisible world that lurks underneath the surface. Few words are needed. We feel with Juan and easily relate to him. The scenes where he cares for his father, becoming his father’s father, are particularly moving."
