The First Edition is the debut studio album by the group the First Edition. Kenny Rogers sang the lead vocals on two tracks "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)" and "Dream On". "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)" became the only hit single from the album and marked the start of things to come, with Rogers soon becoming the lead singer of the group and the group being renamed "Kenny Rogers & the First Edition".
This album was re-issued as a 180 Gram Limited Edition by Golden Lane Records in 2010 (as #CLP-LP-1822). While the cover art and back art is exactly the same as the original Reprise record, the record itself is poor quality, and the inner sleeve has the original Alcoa Aluminum sweepstakes ad, on one side, but on the reverse side it has an updated biography of the First Edition written by Dave Thompson.
The producer of this album (and also the band's second and third albums), Mike Post gained later renown for the theme music for many TV dramas such as Hill Street Blues, Magnum, P.I., Law & Order and others.
