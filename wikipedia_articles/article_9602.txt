The largest state-owned hospital in Uganda is Mulago Hospital in Kampala with around 1,500 beds. It was built in 1962.
Ian Clarke, a physician and missionary from Northern Ireland, built the 200-bed International Hospital Kampala, which was the first International Organization for Standardization-certified hospital in the country.
According to a report published in 2009, the distribution of healthcare facilities and funding heavily favored urban centers, with 70 percent of physicians and 40 percent of nurses and midwives based in urban areas, where they served only 12 percent of Uganda's population.
