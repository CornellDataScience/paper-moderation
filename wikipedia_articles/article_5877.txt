Katie Armiger's self-titled debut album was released on Cold River Records in the U.S. on August 21, 2007. It was produced by Mark Oliverius, the producer for other country acts such as Lorrie Morgan and Trick Pony. The first seven tracks of her album were co-written by Armiger with Oliverius and Ashlee Hewitt.
Armiger entered the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the first time in 2010 with "Kiss Me Now," which reached a peak of number 55. It served as the lead-off to her third album, Confessions of a Nice Girl, which was released in October 2010, and became her first album to chart. It charted on both Billboard Top Country Albums and Billboard Heatseekers. This album was Armiger's first self-titled album and featured nine tracks that Armiger co-wrote with Nashville songwriters. "Leaving Home" and "Best Song Ever" followed as the album's second and third singles, the former failed to chart, while the latter peaked at number 42. Her third album was re-released on September 20, 2011 to include her fourth single, "I Do But Do I", which was released to radio on July 11, 2011. The re-release also included three more new songs, a dance mix of "Best Song Ever", and the music videos for "I Do But Do I" and "Best Song Ever." "Scream," which was released as the fifth and final single from the album in October 2011, peaked at number 47 on the Hot Country Songs chart.
"Better in a Black Dress" was released in mid-June 2012, debuting at number 54 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart for the week of June 23, 2012. Since then, the song has become her highest charting single. The album that followed on January 22, 2013, Fall Into Me, became her highest charting album to date. It marked Armiger's first entry on the Independent Albums chart (No. 6) and the all-genre Billboard 200 (No. 32). It also became her first top 10 country album, debuting at number 7. The album's second single, "Playin' with Fire", was released February 11, 2013.
