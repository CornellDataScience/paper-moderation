Khoja was appointed dean of the faculty of education in Mecca in 1979, and his term lasted until 1984.

Later, he served as the Saudi Ambassador to various countries, including Turkey (1991), Russia and Morocco. He was also Saudi ambassador to Lebanon and was in office from 2004 to 2009. During this period of time, King Abdullah's foreign policy towards Lebanon was highly intense and also seen as an interventionist approach.
