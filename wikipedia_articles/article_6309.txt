At 20, Jindal began his entrepreneurial journey by moving to Calcutta, where he worked as a trader dealing in steel pipes and tubes. He traded in iron and transported surplus pipes from Assam to sell in Calcutta, much of which came from metal left behind by the United States Army Air Forces' Tenth Air Force after World War II. By the age of 22 in 1952, he set up a factory in Liluah in Howrah to make pipe bends and sockets by using waste pipe products from Tata's Jamshedpur factory and Kalinga Tubes' Cuttack factory. In 1964, he expanded his ventures by founding Jindal India Limited, a full-fledged pipe-production company. Five years later, he established another factory in Calcutta.
He went on to establish Jindal Steel and Power, JSW Group and Jindal Stainless Limited under the flagship of the OP Jindal Group, of which he was the founding chairman. In November 2004, Jindal was awarded the "Life Time Achievement Award" for his outstanding contribution to the Indian steel industry by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
