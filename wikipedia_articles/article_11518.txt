EXMAR Ship Management is a Belgian registered maritime company. It was established in 1991 as part of the shipping activities of the Compagnie Maritime Belge group. Compangnie Maritime Belge was established in 1895 as a diversified shipping group with its headquarters in Antwerp, Belgium.
When the CMB shareholders decided on the de-merger of the company by spinning off its Gas Transport Business into a new Belgian listed public limited liability company, EXMAR Shipmanagement NV became a full affiliate of Exmar NV.

=== Overview ===
EXMAR Ship Management has been involved in the management of LNG and LPG vessels since the early 1980s, as the primary ship manager of EXMAR NV, as well as other owners such as Avance. Exmar NV is supervising an LPG carrier new building program and a refit of its LNG fleet to accommodate Regas operations on a number of its LNG Gas Carriers. EXMAR Ship Management Superintendents are typically former serving Officers who manage vessels from NB spec review to full operations. Similarly, the experience gained in assisting the owner during pre-delivery and the first months of operation (first outfit, guarantee items, etc.) are utilized for the subsequent technical superintendence of the vessel. The company's Marine Department manages all aspects of vessel conformance with the relevant ISO, OHSAS and TMSA standards.
Training programs have been set up with the Antwerp Maritime Academy and other Institutes for in-depth training with the STCW and ARPA, BRM, GMDSS and full mission Bridge simulators.
