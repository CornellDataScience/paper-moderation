== History ==
In 1639, Colony's Sawmill stood at the corner of East 74th Street and Second Avenue, in the Dutch village of New Amsterdam, at which enslaved African laborers cut lumber.
In 1664, the English took over Manhattan and the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam from the Dutch. English colonial Governor of the Province of New York Richard Nicolls made 74th Street, beginning at the East River, the southern border patent line (which was called the "Harlem Line") of the village of Nieuw Haarlem (later, the village of Harlem); the British also renamed the village "Lancaster".
That year Jan van Bonnel built a sawmill on East 74th Street and the East River, where a 13.71-kilometer-long (8.52 mi) creek or stream, which began in the north of today's Central Park and became known as Saw Kill or Saw Kill Creek, emptied into the river. George Elphinstone and Abraham Shotwell, later owners of the property, replaced the sawmill with a leather mill in 1677. The Saw Kill Bridge was built and since at least 1806 was known as "The Kissing Bridge" because its surrounding beautiful landscape and seclusion made it a favorite spot to kiss in 18th and 19th century Manhattan.
East 74th Street between Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue) and Fifth Avenue was the northern boundary of a 30-acre (120,000 m2) farm known as the "Lenox Farm" created by pieces of land that Robert Lenox purchased in 1818; the area later became known as Lenox Hill.
Frederick Ambrose Clark developed a good portion of West 74th Street in 1902–04.
In 1938, an open-air market on East 74th Street, east of Second Avenue, was supplanted by an enclosed market.
