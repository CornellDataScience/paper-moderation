Empress Xiaochengren (3 February 1654 – 6 June 1674), of the Manchu Plain Yellow Banner Hešeri clan, was a posthumous name bestowed to the wife and first empress consort of Xuanye, the Kangxi Emperor. She was empress consort of Qing from 1665 until her death in 1674. Although her marriage was a purely political one, the Kangxi Emperor was very fond of her and left the position of empress vacant for about three years after her death.

Her father, Gabula (噶布喇; d.1681), served as a military general and also held a title of duke.

=== Shunzhi era ===
The future Empress Xiaochengren was born on the 17th day of the 12th lunar month in the tenth year of the reign of the Shunzhi Emperor, which translates to 3 February 1654 in the Gregorian calendar.


=== Kangxi era ===
In October or November 1665, Lady Hešeri married the Kangxi Emperor and became empress consort because her powerful family could help the emperor on his rules. Although it was a purely political marriage, the Kangxi Emperor was very fond of the Empress. On 4 January 1670, she gave birth to a son, Chenghu, who would die prematurely on 3 March 1672. The death of Prince Chenghu hit the Empress very much, and she became very sick. The Emperor who was staying in Chicheng heard that Lady Hešeri was seriously ill, and he set off for Beijing immediately to take care of Lady Hešeri. After the Empress recovered, she became pregnant again.
The Empress died on 6 June 1674 shortly after giving birth to the emperor's second son, Yunreng. The emperor was extremely sad about the Empress's death, so he made her son the crown prince. After her death, the Kangxi Emperor left the position of empress vacant for about three years before instating one of his consorts, Lady Niohuru, as Empress, on 18 September 1677.
