Fritton is a village and former civil parish in county of Norfolk, England. The village is located 6 miles (9.7 km) south-west of Great Yarmouth and 16 miles (26 km) south-east of Norwich, along the A143 between Gorleston-on-Sea and Haverhill. In 1961 the parish had a population of 192.


== History ==
The origins of Fritton's name is uncertain, and it either derives from the Old English for a settlement of refuge or safety or an amalgamation of the Old English and Old Norse for Frithi's settlement or village.
In the Domesday Book, Fritton is listed as a settlement of 63 households in the hundred of Depwade. In 1086, the village was divided between the East Anglian estates of Robert Malet, Roger Bigod of Norfolk, Bury St Edmunds Abbey, Ralph Baynard and Robert, son of Corbucion.
Caldecott Hall was built as a manor-house in the Fifteenth Century and belonged to the family of Sir John Fastolf, the basis of William Shakespeare's John Falstaff. The Paston Letters record the bitter struggle between the Paston and Debenham families over the inheritance of Caldecott Hall.
During the Second World War, Fritton Lake was requisitioned by the 79th Armoured Division for the secret training of DD Amphibious tanks in preparation for the Normandy landings. Between 1943 and 1945, over 2,000 men from the British, Canadian and American Armies were trained on Fritton Lake.
Today the village forms part of the civil parish of Fritton and St. Olaves, which in turn is within the district of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. However prior to the Local Government Act 1972, the village was within Lothingland Rural District in Suffolk.[1] The parish of Fritton was abolished on 1 April 1974 to form "Fritton and St. Olaves".
