"Bury My Body" is a traditional gospel blues song. It is also known as "(Lord) I Don't Care Where Dey (They, You) Bury My Body" and "My Soul Is Gonna Live with God".
The origins of the song are obscure. The earliest recording may be by the Norfolk Jazz and Jubilee Quartets, as "Lord, I Don't Care Where They Bury My Body", in 1927–29. The various titles are taken from the chorus: "Bury my body, Lord, I don't care where; for my soul is gonna live with God".
As is common with traditional songs, the words vary between performers. The verses sometimes seem to refer to the miracle of the empty tomb; at others to the rapture; at yet others to the singer's indifference to the manner of disposal of his or her remains, as a small matter compared with salvation.
