Tightrope Books was a Canadian independent book publisher based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Founded in 2005 by Halli Villegas, Tightrope Books publishes mainly poetry and fiction, as well as non-fiction and anthologies. As a "writer-centric press," Tightrope Books involves its authors and poets in the publishing process. According to Villegas, Tightrope Books “prides itself on introducing readers to writers who are a little bit out there,” working with both new and established authors who are open to experimentation. Tightrope Books was purchased by Jim Nason in 2014.
Tightrope Books is represented by the Independent Publishers Group (IPG).


== Annual publications ==
Among the publications are the annual anthologies, Best Canadian Poetry in English and Best Canadian Essays. For both series, the series and guest editors collaborate and choose the best poems and essays by Canadians published in the preceding year from online and print Canadian literary journals.
The idea for the anthologies sprung from The Best American Poetry Series created by David Lehman.
