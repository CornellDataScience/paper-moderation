== History ==
The church was originally a part of the Catholic church but it was  confiscated by Danish crown after the Reformation. In 1687 the crown gave Tranbjerg Church to baron Constantin Marselis as payment for debts incurred during the Swedish Wars. When Constantin Marselis died the church was inherited by his widow Elisbeth Charisius in 1699 who made it a part of the estate of the manor Constantinsborg. In 1799 the church was sold on auction to the church parishioners. Tranbjerg Church is today a part of the Church of Denmark.


== Architecture ==
The original part of the church, the chancel and nave, probably dates from the latter half of the 12th century and is constructed of split and rough granite boulders. Ashlar is used at the windows, doors and the corners of the building. Some time in the Late Middle Ages the tower and porch was added and the flat, wooden ceiling was replaced by a groin vault. The altar tablet from the 1400s feature a depiction of St. Ursula along with Virgin Mary, the Jesus child and John the Apostle. The pulpit is from 1675-1700 and was renovated in 1998.
