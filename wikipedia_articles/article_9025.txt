== History ==
The location name comes from the 1870s agricultural and grazing property of Charles Overend Garbutt (1850â€“1905).  Garbutt came from Marton Hall, Middlesbrough-on-Tees, Yorkshire, England.  The 3,400 acres (1,400 hectares) Spring Creek holdings went to auction in December 1877 as Garbutt was moving from the district.  It was then purchased by Harry and William Webb until 1882, before being purchased by June 1896 by the Queensland Government under the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act 1894 (and the later Closer Settlement Act 1906) where the property was subdivided into agricultural blocks.
Cryna Provisional School opened on 30 April 1907. On 1 January 1909 it became Cryna State School. It closed in 1935.
The Beaudesert Shire Tramway passed through the area but did not have a station.  The closest station was at Josephville or the terminus in Beaudesert.
