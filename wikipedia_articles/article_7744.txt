Allen Hopkins (born November 18, 1951) is an American professional pocket billiards (pool) player, professional billiards color commentator and BCA Hall of Fame inductee. He promotes multiple annual pool events and still competes as a professional contender.


== Early life ==
Allen Hopkins was born November 18, 1951, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and was raised in the small suburban town of Cranford, New Jersey by adoptive parents Paul and Marietta Hopkins.


== Amateur days ==
At seven years old, after watching many tournaments on television, Allen began to play pool on a small table his parents bought for him.  As an amateur, at the age of 12, Hopkins ran a prodigious 110 balls and took this talent to play against grown men.


== Pool career ==
Hopkins' professional career began in the 1970s and spans over four decades.  He co-founded and served on the board the now-defunct Professional Pool Players Association (PPPA), as well as president of the Professional Billiard Association (PBA).
At the 1979 PPPA World Open 14.1 Pocket Billiard Championship in New York City, New York, Hopkins posted the largest victory margin in the event, defeating Richie Florence, 150-1.
Allen Hopkins has earned titles in such varied events as the 1977 World Straight Pool Championship, the 1978 and 1981 U.S. Open 9-Ball Championships, the 1990 Cleveland Open 10-Ball Classic and the 1991 Legends of One-Pocket event.
In both 1986 and 1987, Hopkins was the All Japan Championship all around champion.
In 1993, he saw victory in the International Challenge of Champions.
Allen Hopkins has a high run of 410 in straight pool (14.1 continuous), and has run 15-and-out three times, in the game of one-pocket.
In 2002, Hopkins triumphed in the Denver Ten-ball Open, defeating Earl Strickland, Filipino champion Jose Parica, Corey Deuel, David Matlock, and faced Shannon Daulton in a thrilling double-hill finals.
In 2008, he was inducted to the BCA Hall of Fame by the Billiard Congress of America.
