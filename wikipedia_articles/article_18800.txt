The 2022–23 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 101st season of play for the program and the 39th in the Hockey East conference. The Eagles represented Boston College in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, playing their home games at Kelley Rink. They were coached by Greg Brown in his 1st season, after taking over for longtime head coach Jerry York who retired after 50 years behind an NCAA bench, 28 of which were for the Eagles.


== Previous season recap ==
The Eagles entered the 2022–23 season following a lackluster 2021–22 campaign. With a 15–8–5 record, going 9–12–3 in conference play, the Eagles finished eighth in Hockey East and failed to secure a berth to the NCAA tournament. Despite a relatively strong start to the year in which they brought trophies home from both the Ice Breaker tournament and Ledyard Bank Classic, the Eagles suffered a 12-game winless streak to start the 2nd half of the year. During that stretch, they fell in the Beanpot opener to Northeastern and tied with Harvard for 3rd place (the first of its kind in tournament history). The postseason only saw the Eagles advance to the Quarterfinals of the Hockey East tournament; after beating New Hampshire in the Opening Round, Northeastern defeated Boston College to deny them a trip to the semi-finals.
