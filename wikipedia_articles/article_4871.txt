She became the team's captain in 2017.
At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Larson earned a silver medal with the United States. The team, which was ranked number one in the world going into the competition, was undefeated in pool play, but fell to Brazil in the gold medal match.
Larson played with the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The team was once again undefeated in pool play, but lost to Serbia in the semi-finals. In the bronze medal match against the Netherlands, Larson led the team to victory with 13 kills.
On June 7, 2021, U.S. National Team head coach Karch Kiraly announced Larson would be part of the 12-player Olympic roster for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, making her the fifth oldest volleyball player in U.S. history to be named to an Olympics roster. The team went on to win America's first-ever women's Olympic volleyball gold medal, with Larson scoring the final point in a straight-sets victory over Brazil in the gold medal match.
Though Larson had intended for 2020 to be her last Olympics, she came out of retirement in the spring of 2023 and was named to the roster for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.
