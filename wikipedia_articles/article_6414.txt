== History ==
Nannestad was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).
Store norske leksikon writes that "At søndre Låke gård (a farm), South of Nannestad Church, Skule Bårdsson beat Birkebeinar (a political group), [... on a battlefield] South of the farm".


== Name and coat-of-arms ==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Nannestad farm (Old Norse: Nannastaðir), since the first church was built here.  The first element is the genitive case of Nanni (an old Norse male name) and the last element is staðir which means "homestead" or "farm".
The coat-of-arms is from modern times.  They were granted in 1990.  The arms show three yellow coltsfoot flowers on a green background.  This is a flower that is prevalent in the area.
