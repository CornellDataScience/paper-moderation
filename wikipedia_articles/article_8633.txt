Woman, Life, Freedom (Kurdish: Jin, Jiyan, Azadî, ژن، ژیان، ئازادی) is a slogan that originated within the women-led Kurdish movements. This slogan transcended its initial context and garnered global recognition following the 2022 protests in Iran, sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, who was in custody of Iran’s morality police for “improper” clothing. The phrase rapidly became a universal rallying cry, symbolizing resistance against oppression and the fight for women's rights.


== Origin ==
The origin of the slogan can be traced to the Kurdish freedom movement of the late twentieth century. It was first used by the Women's Protection Units in Kurdish mountains in early 2000’s.
The slogan marked the political activities of Kurdish women in the 2000s and was considered attractive because of its spelling, rhythm and connotational significance.
In 2004, Abdullah Ocalan recommended the Kurdish Women’s Freedom Movement to adopt it as the official motto.
Kurdish women's movement is part of the Kurdish freedom movement which was founded on grassroots activism in response to persecution from the governments of Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria. The slogan 'Woman, Life, Freedom' was emblematically used by Kurdish fighters, notably in their successful efforts to lift the siege imposed by ISIS on Kobani, Syria.


== Spread around the world ==

The slogan gained its height in international traction following the internationalization of the Mahsa Jina Amini protests across European countries, United States and Australia. Prior to that, the slogan was also used by women's rights movements in a number of international gatherings. For example, on 25 November 2015 it was used in gatherings held to mark International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in several European countries.


=== Afghanistan ===

On 20 September 2022, the slogan was chanted by Afghan women in a protest in support of women protesting in Iran.


=== Canada ===
Several hundred members of the University of Toronto community held a vigil at Convocation Hall in September 2022 to mourn Mahsa Amini. The vigil was especially poignant for the University of Toronto community, remembering the loss of several members in Flight 752, shot down by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in January 2020. Speakers at the vigil, including Iranian women's rights activist Azam Jangravi and others connected to Flight 752 victims, condemned the violent regime and called for an end to gender-based harassment and violence, including against LGBTQ+ people. The vigil also highlighted the fears of those in the Iranian diaspora about returning to Iran and underscored the broader movement against the regime's oppression, emphasizing the involvement of queer individuals in the struggle for freedom and rights.


=== France ===
In 2018, during Cannes Film Festival, the cast of Girls of the Sun chanted "jin jiyan azadî". The slogan was later printed in Persian on the first page of the French newspaper Libération in September 2022 following protests against the death of Mahsa Amini.


=== Germany ===
On Saturday 22 October 2022, tens of thousands of people converged in Berlin to express solidarity with Iranian protesters, motivated by the death of Mahsa Amini. Organized by the Woman-Life-Freedom collective, the demonstration started at the Victory Column in Berlin's Tiergarten park and moved through central Berlin, with Berlin police estimating the participation at around 80,000. Protesters displayed the Iranian Lion and Sun flags and placards condemning Iran's regime, echoing the slogan "Women, Life, Freedom" in English and German. A highlight was a speaker urging the international community to expel Iranian ambassadors and avoid negotiations with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, criticizing the rapid and harsh treatment of dissidents in Iran. Additionally, the protest saw participants from various parts of Germany and Europe, indicating a widespread support network. Amidst calls for social solidarity and other causes, the Berlin protest underscored the global resonance of Iran's ongoing struggle for freedom and rights.


=== Iran ===

The use of the slogan "Woman, Life, Freedom" goes back to series of protests following the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022, who was arrested and detained by Iran's ”morality police” for failing to properly cover her hair and later died in police custody.
In the protests following Mahsa Amini's demise while under the custody of Iranian authorities, a wave of swift public protests spread. These protests consisted of women defiantly removing and burning their headscarves, cutting their hair, and boldly confronting and fighting against the forces of the authorities. Riots began to form as local leading groups such as "the Covenant" and "Neighbourhood Youth Alliance" began to spread the news online and called for protests. the government, in response, resorted to internet restrictions and shutdowns to stifle the organization of further protests and stop the local leaders. The protestors instead resorted to TV, where the foreign oppositions later spread the rallying cry: "Women, life, freedom," symbolizing the essence of this rapid and transformative movement. Since the Islamic revolution of 1979, these protests presented the most immediate challenge to Iran's regime. The response from the police to the protests resulted in the death of more than 500 civilians and the imprisonment of over 1000.
The slogan was chanted at Amini's funeral in Saqqez and then was spread online by an organization and it became a trending hashtag. Later it was heard in initial protests in Sanandaj after the funeral. On 21 September, the slogan was chanted by students at University of Tehran, and by protesters around the country in the following days. On 28 September and the continuation of protests, students at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences used the slogan in their protests along with a new, similar slogan: "Woman, Life, Freedom; Man, Homeland, Prosperity". Overnight, the protests spread across 15 cities in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini. Police continued to arrest more people and deployed tear gas to scatter the crowds.
Following the expansion of Iranian protests to other cities of the world, rallies were held in different cities with protesters using the slogan "Women, Life, Freedom" along with other slogans. Due to its expansion to cities around the world, and extensive coverage on foreign media, the French newspaper Libération used an image of Iranian protests with the slogan in Persian accompanied by its French translation. It was also used at the closing section of the lyrics for the song "Baraye" by Shervin Hajipour, who was detained by police after he received worldwide acclaim for the song. His song "Baraye" was later sung in global protests for Iran on 1 October 2022 in approximately 150 cities around the world.
In February 2023 twenty independent Iranian trade unions, feminist groups and student organizations issued a 12-point manifesto. It articulated and elaborated on the meaning of the slogan "woman, life, freedom", seeking an end to oppression, discrimination, tyranny, and dictatorship.


=== Turkey ===
This slogan has been repeatedly used in Turkey by Saturday Mothers. The slogan was also chanted by Turkish protesters in Turkey, when they gathered to protest in front of the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 21 September 2022.


=== India ===
The slogan was spotted drawn on the road during the 2024 Meyeder Raat Dokhol Movement in Kolkata, as citizens demanded greater safety for women  the society, particularly at night time.


== Culture and Art ==
The slogan "Woman, Life, Freedom" has resonated deeply within the cultural and artistic communities, inspiring various forms of expression that underscore its significance and impact.
In a scene from the film "Girls of the Sun" starring Golshifteh Farahani, Bahar, the Yazidi commander of the women's unit, shouts for women, for life, and for freedom before starting an operation against ISIS.
In the midst of the 2022 uprising in Iran, specifically in early November, music students at the University of Tehran's School of Arts reinterpreted the revolutionary anthem "Rise up, remove, the foundation of the enemy's palace," linking it back to the 1979 revolution and the Confederation of Iranian Students. The new rendition began with the lines "Rise up for women, life, freedom." Similarly, on November 17, students at Sharif University of Technology performed this anthem, demonstrating its enduring appeal and relevance.
"Baraye," a powerful ballad by Iranian musician Shervin Hajipour, has resonated deeply as an anthem of protest, capturing the collective aspirations of Iranians globally after the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Drawing inspiration from social media posts of Iranians longing for freedom and change, the song encapsulates a broad spectrum of grievances, from societal restrictions to environmental issues. Released on Hajipour's Instagram, "Baraye" quickly went viral but resulted in the artist's arrest and subsequent release on bail. Despite these challenges, the song's influence continued to grow, culminating in a significant accolade. Shervin Hajipour received the Best Song for Social Change Award at the 2023 Grammys, marking a historic recognition of the song's profound impact on social activism. "Baraye" has not only underscored the ongoing struggle for freedom and rights in Iran but has also inspired various forms of solidarity and expression worldwide, from university events to political activism.
In October 2022, Coldplay brought the Iranian protest anthem "Baraye" into the global spotlight by performing it at their Buenos Aires concert, with the performance broadcast to 81 countries but notably not Iran, where the song could lead to arrest.
A notable instance of international artistic solidarity occurred on Wednesday, 16 November 2022, at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, London, during the "Woman, Life, Freedom" concert. This event featured a collaborative performance by Iranian and international artists, including Faramarz Aslani, Golnar Shahyar, Lianne La Havas, Sakina Teyna, Kelsey Lu, Diaspora, and Lafawndah, who expressed their support for the women of Iran.
In November 2023, an image of Jodie Foster wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the "Woman, Life, Freedom" slogan gained attention, highlighting the slogan's widespread recognition and endorsement beyond activist circles and into mainstream culture.
