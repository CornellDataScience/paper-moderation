John Dennis Phelan (March 23, 1809 – September 9, 1879) was an American editor, politician and jurist. He served as Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives.


== Early life ==
Phelan was born on March 23, 1809, in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  He was the son of John Phelan (d. 1850), an Irish immigrant, and Priscilla Oakes (née Ford) Phelan (1785–1864), of New England stock, who moved to Richmond and, later, Huntsville, Alabama in 1818.  His father was cashier of the Bank of New Brunswick during the War of 1812.  His brother was James Phelan, Sr., also a jurist and journalist.
He graduated at the University of Nashville in 1828 and studied law in Virginia with the Hon. Benjamin Watkins Leigh.


== Career ==
After being admitted to the bar in Virginia, he returned to Alabama in 1830.  He became editor of the Huntsville Democrat. From 1833 to 1835, he served in the Alabama Legislature as a Democrat representing Madison County, until he became the Attorney General of Alabama in 1836.  After he was succeeded at Attorney General by Lincoln Clark in 1838, he returned to the Legislature where he was elected Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives in 1839, serving in that role until 1840.
From 1841 to 1851, he was a judge of the circuit court, until his elevation to the Alabama Supreme Court in 1851, holding that office for two years until 1853, and then again in 1863-65 when "he was removed by the 'Reconstruction' carpet-bag ruler of Alabama."  In the interval when he was not a judge in the Alabama Supreme Court, he was clerk to that body, and also later in 1865–68.  He published two poems about Civil War, “Good Old Cause” and “Ye Men of Alabama.” He became professor of law in the University of the South in 1869, holding the chair until his death.
