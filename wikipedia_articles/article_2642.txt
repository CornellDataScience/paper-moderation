== Business life ==
In Brisbane, John Daniel Heal worked at his trade as a stonemason.
In 1863, he leased the Prince Consort Hotel in Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley and became a publican. He bought the hotel in 1879 and by 1887 had acquired a number of adjoining properties. In 1887–1888, Heal tore down the old hotel and had a larger hotel erected, the now heritage-listed Prince Consort Hotel which was designed by Richard Gailey, a well-known Brisbane architect. When completed, the new hotel had one of the largest bars in Brisbane, three parlours, a large dining room, billiard room, kitchen, cellar, six bathrooms, twenty-eight bedrooms with four large shops on the ground floor.
He became a major contractor and prominent businessman in Brisbane.

He was very involved in community affairs and was a great advocate for the progress of Fortitude Valley.  In 1870 he was elected to the Brisbane Council as an alderman for the Fortitude Valley Ward.  He served his electorate in this role from 1870 to 1873, losing to Nicholas Corrigan in 1874. However, the following year, Heal won the ward of Fortitude Valley back (Corrigan did not stand for election) and held it until 1894, after which he did not seek re-election. He was mayor in 1879.
