Judith Louise MacManus-Driscoll is a Professor of Materials Science at the University of Cambridge. Driscoll is known for her interdisciplinary work on thin film engineering. She has a particular focus on functional oxide systems, demonstrating new ways to engineer thin films to meet the required applications performance. She has worked extensively in the fields of high temperature superconductors, ferroics and multiferroics, ionics, and semiconductors. She holds several licensed patents.


== Research and career ==
Driscoll (also known as MacManus-Driscoll in her publications) earned her PhD in 1991 at the University of Cambridge under Profs. Jan Evetts and Derek Fray FRS. 
From 1991 to 1995, she trained as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University and IBM Almaden Research Center where she worked under Ted Geballe, Robby Beyers and John Bravman. In 1995, she joined Imperial College London as a lecturer in the Department of Materials, and was promoted to Reader in 1999. She then did a sabbatical at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2003 where she has remained a visiting staff member/visiting faculty ever since. She joined the University of Cambridge in the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy in 2003, and was promoted to Full Professor in 2008. She is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge and Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies in advanced memory materials.
Driscoll was founding editor-in-chief of the American Institute of Physics's journal APL Materials and held the position for 10 years from 2013.
