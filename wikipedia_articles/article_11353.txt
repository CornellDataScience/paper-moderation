Bradley is best known for playing the role of Pinhead, the lead Cenobite, in the first eight Hellraiser films, as well as Captain Elliot Spencer in two of the films, Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988) and Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992).

Bradley appeared as a gym teacher in an advertisement for Direct Line insurance in the UK. He has performed narrations on several songs by Cradle of Filth, an English extreme metal band. The first was 2000's "Her Ghost in the Fog", as well as "Death Magick for Adepts" and "Tortured Soul Asylum", from the album Midian.

Continuing in this vein, Bradley has contributed guest vocals to Cradle of Filth's 2008 album Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder, on all songs except "Tragic Kingdom". He returned for their 2021 album, Existence is Futile, on the songs "Sisters of the Mist" and "Suffer Our Dominian".
Bradley has appeared in many short horror films, such as Red Lines and On Edge. He is a member of the UK animation company Renga Media, makers of the independent Dominator films and shorts, dividing job roles between producer and voice actor.
