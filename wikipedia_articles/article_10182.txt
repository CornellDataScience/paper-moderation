Rose Melberg is a musician and songwriter from Sacramento, California, currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She has performed both as a solo artist and as a member of Tiger Trap, The Softies, Go Sailor, Gaze, Gigi, Imaginary Pants, Brave Irene, Knife Pleats and Olivia's World.
Melberg was raised by working musicians and following her appearance right out of high school at the International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, Washington in August 1991, she had almost instant success with the all-female band Tiger Trap. The short-lived band garnered a cult following in indie-pop circles. In 2002 she gave birth to a son and lived with her husband and family in Summerland, British Columbia, Canada. She returned to the pop world in 2006 with her second solo album, Cast Away the Clouds. Melberg toured briefly for the album, including a spot opening for Belle and Sebastian. Her third solo album, Homemade Ship, was released on K Records in 2009. The track "Old Days" was featured as Song Of The Day by NPR Music.
As of 2011, she was a part of two groups, Brave Irene and Imaginary Pants. In 2019, the band Olivia's World, featuring Melberg along with Lica Rezende and Joe Saxby, released its debut EP.
