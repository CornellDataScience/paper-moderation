Live In Barcelona is a full concert video DVD of a performance by Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band of their Rising Tour performance of October 16, 2002 at Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
The first half of the show was broadcast live at the time across Europe on MTV Europe and VH1 UK; the broadcast concluded with Springsteen's biggest hit, "Dancing in the Dark", unusually placed in the middle of the regular set for that reason.  A tape of the broadcast was later aired by CBS in the United States on February 28, 2003 as well. The performance of "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" was released as a music video to promote the single.
Released on November 18, 2003 after the tour's conclusion and now incorporating the complete Barcelona performance, this DVD was the first time that an entire Springsteen concert was documented with an official release in either audio or video. Unlike the prior tour's concert video Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: Live in New York City, no equivalent audio-only album release was made.
