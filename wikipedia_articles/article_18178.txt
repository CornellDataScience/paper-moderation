Reclus Peninsula (64°33′S 61°47′W) is a 7 nautical miles (13 km; 8.1 mi) peninsula on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica.
It borders Charlotte Bay to its east.


== Location ==

Recluse Peninsula lies on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.
It extends northward into the Gerlache Strait between Charlotte Bay to the east and Wilhelmina Bay to the west.
Nansen Island is to the west.
The Forbidden Plateau is to the southwest and the Foster Plateau is to the southeast.


== Mapping and name ==
Reclus Peninsula was first charted in 1898 by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition under Adrien de Gerlache, who named its northern extremity "Cap Reclus" for the French geographer and author Élisée Reclus (1830–1905). 
The UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) extended the name Reclus to the entire peninsula in 1960.
