== History ==
Mukkam is an immigrant town. Migration started in 1940 in the eastern hills of Malabar. Poverty and famine were among the major devastation wrought by World War II. Ordinary people in Kerala could not bear the misery caused by infectious diseases, famine and inflation. The scarcity of resources also made the public distribution system inadequate. In those days, palm fronds, and taro were the staple food of the common man. There was a large population in central Travancore who made a living from agriculture. The knowledge that they would buy acres of land in Malabar if they sold the small land in the country attracted them to Malabar.
They came to Malabar without clear information and understanding about this area. Prior to the independence of India, the region was under the jurisdiction of a section of the authorities. The religious harmony of the region is as old as this land where people of different religions live. Immigration to the region began in Thiruvambadi. In 1942, the Thiruvambadi area became known as Nairkolli.
It is the confluence of a small river and an even larger river, the Iruvanji. The Thrikkudamanna Shiva Temple is located here and is believed to have been dedicated to Mahamuni Augustine. Muhammad Abdurahman Sahib, described by Gandhi of Kerala, breathed his last during the freedom struggle in Pottassery in this village. Before roads and bridges, man relied on rivers and streams for transportation and movement of goods. The face, which is surrounded by two parts and two sides, stands in front of the transport facility. Therefore, it has become a populated area here. The main occupation at that time was to cut wood from the nearby hills, tie the rope and load it on the boats and bring it to Kozhikode. The timber merchants also became the mainstay of Mukkam economy at that time. The landlords were known for their hospitality.
