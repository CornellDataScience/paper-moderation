Le Retour de Gérard Lambert is the fifth studio album by French singer-songwriter Renaud. It was released in 1981 by Polydor Records. In Renaud's overall discography the album was released between two live albums, Un Olympia pour moi tout seul (1982) and Le P'tit Bal du samedi soir et autres chansons réalistes (1981).
The album title refers to Gérard Lambert, a character from a song on Renaud's previous studio album Marche à l'ombre, who by this stage has improved his lot from riding a mobylette to driving a Simca 1000.

"Le Père Noël noir" (French for "Black Father Christmas") tells the story of a black burglar that Renaud mistakes for Santa Claus. "Oscar" pays homage to Renaud's grandfather who had been a communist trade-unionist and "La Blanche" was a widely acclaimed anti-drug anthem. "Soleil immonde" was written by a close friend of Renaud, the French humorist Coluche whose 1986 death would provide the inspiration for Renaud's later album Putain de camion.
