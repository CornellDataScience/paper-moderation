"Wrong Baby Wrong Baby Wrong" (re-titled as "Wrong Baby Wrong" for its single release) is a song by American country music recording artist Martina McBride, recorded for her tenth studio album Shine (2010) and is the opening track to the album. The track was written by The Warren Brothers, a duo made up of brothers Brad and Brett Warren, Robert Ellis Orrall, and Stephen Barker Liles of the duo Love and Theft. Sent for country radio on February 1, 2010, the song not only was her first single release of the 2010's, but was also her final single released under RCA Nashville Records, the label she had been signed with since 1991.
The single would reach number 11 on the US Hot Country Songs chart, becoming her 29th top-20 hit but also making Shine McBride's third album to not have a song crack the top ten at country radio following The Time Has Come (1992) and Timeless (2005).
