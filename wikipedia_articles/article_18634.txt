Heng Ee High School (simplified Chinese: 恒毅国民型华文中学; traditional Chinese: 恆毅國民型華文中學; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Hêng-gī kok-bîn-hêng huâ-bûn tiong-o̍h; Malay: Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan Heng Ee) is a Chinese conforming national-type Catholic secondary school located in George Town; Penang.
As Heng Ee High School is a Chinese secondary school (SMJK), Chinese language (Bahasa Cina) is a compulsory subject to be taken during Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) for all students with Chinese primary school background (SJKC). 


== Founding ==
Heng Ee High School was founded by a Belgian Roman Catholic expatriate missionary priest, Dato' Father Arthur A. Julien, from the Paris Foreign Missions Society in 1957.
Father Julien arrived in Malaysia in 1952. He served as parish priest of the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows from 1961 to 1963, and as assistant parish priest to the Church of the Holy Spirit (now Cathedral of the Holy Spirit) with Father Paul Decroix between 1976 and 1984. Father Julien's work extended beyond the church. He conducted missionary work with the community in Batu Maung, Bayan Lepas and Sungai Dua, and also regularly visited the detainees in Pulau Jerejak. His ability to converse in Mandarin and later Hokkien, endeared him to the local Chinese community.
Father Julien set up Heng Ee High School along Hamilton Road and Heng Ee Primary School within the grounds of the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows along Macalister Road. He died on 11 September 2004.

At first the school planned to rebuild the canteen at Level 1 of Bangunan Wawasan. As the number of students increased gradually over the years, the school decided to make it permanent instead of shifting back to its original site. At the same time, three ventilating machines were installed.
