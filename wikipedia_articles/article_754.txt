The Ong is a mythical creature from Washoe folklore, described as a giant bird with an eagle-like body, a warrior's face, and wings longer than the tallest pine trees. The Ong was believed to inhabit the waters of Lake Tahoe, preying on those who wandered too close. According to legend, it carried its victims to its nest at the bottom of the lake, where they were never seen again. The story of the Ong also explains the naming of Lake Tahoe and the bravery of a young warrior who ultimately defeated the creature.


== The story of the Ong ==
The Ong is a creature from Washoe mythology, said to haunt the waters of what is now known as Lake Tahoe. The creature was feared by the Washoe people, who believed it preyed on individuals who wandered too close to the lake, dragging them to its underwater nest where they would be consumed. The legend has been passed down through generations, and it also plays a role in explaining the naming of Lake Tahoe. According to the myth, no weapon could pierce the Ong's tough feathers and scales, making it nearly invincible.


=== Description ===
The Ong was said to have the body of an eagle, the face of a warrior, and wings longer than the tallest pine trees. Its wings could create strong winds on the lake, bending trees along the shore. The bird's webbed feet and its nest at the bottom of the lake allowed it to trap animals, trout, and people swept into the lake, with the Washoe believing that anything caught in the lake's currents would be carried into the Ong's nest. Those who drowned in the lake were thought to be taken by the Ong, their bodies never recovered.
To avoid being captured by the Ong, the Washoe took care not to travel, hunt, or fish alone. The Ong's wing beats were so powerful they could bend trees near the shore whenever it flew by. Despite its great strength, the Ong was described as cowardly, attacking only lone individuals and avoiding groups or people in camps. The creature was invulnerable to arrows and spears due to its tough scales and feathers.


== The battle with the Ong ==
One of the most well-known stories involving the Ong centers on a young Washoe warrior who was in love with Nona, the chief's daughter. Nona's father, the chief, planned to hold a great council fire where warriors would compete for her hand by recounting their brave deeds. However, Nona loved a brave named Tahoe, who had been too young to go on the last war party and had no notable feats to his name. Desperate to prove his bravery, Tahoe prayed to the Great Spirit while sitting alone on cliffs overlooking the lake.
As he prayed, the Ong emerged from the lake. The bird grabbed him in its talons and flew straight into the sky, capturing the attention of the tribe below. Tahoe quickly tied a leather thong around his waist to the leg of the bird, so that when the claws opened to drop him into the lake, he would not fall. The Ong, frustrated that it could not drop him, attempted to reach him with its teeth, but every time it opened its mouth, Tahoe threw poisoned arrowheads into its throat. These arrowheads lodged deep in the bird's unprotected flesh, causing it great pain. Despite the Ong's attempts to shake him off, Tahoe remained attached, and the bird finally plunged into the lake, dragging Tahoe with it.
The tribe believed Tahoe had been lost to the Ong as it disappeared beneath the water. However, the council fire continued that night, as the loss of one brave was not seen as significant as the planned wedding. As the warriors recounted their deeds around the fire, Nona slipped away in a canoe, calling out for Tahoe. She paddled toward the center of the lake, unaware of what had happened to him. At dawn, the tribe was astonished to see the Ong's lifeless body floating on the surface of the lake, and, riding toward the shore on one of the creature's wings, were Nona and Tahoe. The chief proclaimed Tahoe the hero of heroes for defeating the Ong with his poisoned arrowheads.
Another version of the story tells that after the Ong captured a Washoe man and took him to its nest, the man threw shards of pa√ßaga, obsidian arrowheads, into the bird's mouth, killing it. In this version, the Ong had another person to eat before the Washoe man, giving him time to plan his escape. The Washoe noticed that every time the Ong chewed, it closed its eyes, allowing the man to throw arrowheads into the bird's mouth unnoticed. By nightfall, the Ong had fallen ill, and the storm raged through the night. By morning, the creature was dead.


== Modern interpretations and Lake Tahoe's name ==
After the battle, the tribe gathered at the shore of the lake, expecting to mourn the loss of the young warrior. In honor of his bravery, the lake was named after him, and it has since been known as Lake Tahoe.
Though the legend of the Ong ends with its defeat, the creature's story continues to be a significant part of Lake Tahoe folklore. Some believe that the Ong's nest still lies at the bottom of the lake, which explains why the bodies of those who drown in the lake are rarely recovered. The lake's depths are also home to other legends, such as that of Tahoe Tessie, a Loch Ness-like creature said to inhabit the waters.
