== Plot ==
Arib (Ahsan Khan) is an obedient and responsible son who loves his parents. He lives away from his hometown to pursue his job. Ahmareen (Maya Ali) is a college student who lives in a hostel near Arib's lodgings. Arib falls in love with her at first sight, but she leaves the hostel and returns home before he can approach her and confess his feelings. He searches for her but without success. Considering his mother's ill health, Arib feels pressurised and agrees to marry Angabeen (Sohai Ali Abro), whom he has never met before. At the wedding ceremony, he discovers that Ahmareen is his wife's younger sister, but it is too late.
Angabeen is equally unhappy with the marriage. Angabeen and her cousin Farooq (Yasir Shah) were in love with each other for years but could not marry because of conflicts between their families. Initially, both Arib and Angabeen struggle with their feelings. However, as time passes, they accept each other and grow closer. Arib discovers that Angabeen and Farooq had been in love but shows complete trust in his wife and feels touched by her commitment to their marriage. The couple is expecting their first child, and their families are excited about it. However, their lives take an unexpected turn as Angabeen dies after giving birth to a daughter. After some time, both families marry Ahmareen to Arib so the baby can grow under a mother's care. On the wedding night, Arib confesses his feelings for Ahmareen.
Ahmareen gets furious and concludes that Arib schemed to marry her after causing Angabeen's death through ill-treatment and neglect. She leaves the house before Arib can explain anything and disappears, taking the baby with her. Farooq helps Arib to track down Ahmareen and clears the misunderstandings between them. Ahmareen realises that she had overreacted and apologises. Arib and Ahmareen reconcile and begin a new life together.
