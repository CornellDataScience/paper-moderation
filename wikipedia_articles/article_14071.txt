=== Festival of the Lion King ===
On December 28, 2023, a male performer was injured during a segment of the show in which the male performer was to spin a female performer around, whilst being attached to a rope, then releasing to allow the female performer to spin whilst the rope raises to allow the female actor to be airborne. However, the rope attached to a female performer lifted up prematurely, causing the rope to rise with both performers, as opposed to just the female performer. The weight of both performers, and the spinning momentum exerted onto the female performer caused the male performer to twist his arms with the female performer, unable to remain grip, and falling onto the stage, injuring the performer, and temporarily stopping the show.
