== Biography ==
Yorgo Tloupas was born in Paris on the 18 of December 1974. He is the son of the Greek sculptor Philolaos and of an Italian-French art teacher. Tloupas grew up in the Chevreuse Valley, in the house-studio built by his father. An avid sportsman since his childhood, Yorgo says that skateboarding shaped his aesthetic sensibility and visual literacy, while snowboarding was the springboard for his entire professional career: in 1996, freshly graduated from ESAG Penninghen, he sold his final art school project, a logo and a range of snowboards, to Rossignol.
His graphic design studio Yorgo&Co,  founded in Paris in 2011, works with luxury, art, fashion, sports, media and automotive brands such as Artcurial, Cartier, Diptyque, Hermès, Hôtel de Crillon, Lacoste, Louis Vuitton, Loro Piana, Martell, Omega and Swatch, among many others.
Yorgo Tloupas has been involved in blackcrows skis from the start, and today he helps the brand grow, both as a shareholder and as its design director. The blackcrows 2017-2018 ski range is part of the permanent collection of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.
He teaches logo design at ESAG Penninghen, IFM, ECAL as well as SciencesPo Paris, and holds conferences and talks worldwide. In 2018 he has held a TEDxSciencesPo talk on (re)branding.
