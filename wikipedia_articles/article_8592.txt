=== 2022: Rebranding ===
April 2021, Washington Legislature passed House Bill 1356 prohibiting the inappropriate use of Native American names, symbols, or images as public school mascots, logos, or team names without tribal consent. In February, 2022, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation revoked the use of the 'Chiefs' mascot for Moses Lake High School in addition to the 'Braves' at Columbia Middle School (formerly Chief Moses Middle School) and the 'Warriors' at Frontier Middle School in Moses Lake. Moses Lake High School began the rebranding process in 2022. With student, staff, and community involvement, the 'Mavericks' was selected as the new mascot.
