Pierre Chevalier (born in Orbec, France on 23 March 1915; died on 10 February 2005) was a French film director and screenwriter. His films included mainstream, erotic and pornographic films. Horror film buffs know him for his 1971 opus Orloff and the Invisible Man (a.k.a. The Invisible Dead).
He also assisted well-known directors in films, notably with Henri Verneuil, René Clément, Jesus Franco and others. Chevalier directed four films with French actress Alice Arno. He served as art director on Jesus Franco's Man Hunter (1980), and filmed some additional footage that was added to the adult film Cecilia (the retitled 1983 re-release version of Jesus Franco's Sexual Aberrations of a Married Woman).
Jesus Franco co-directed Convoy of Women with Chevalier (uncredited) in 1974. The film was re-released in 1978 as East of Berlin.
