==== 2023–24: Primeira Liga Team of Year and departure ====
Neves started the 2023–24 season, on 9 August, being named man of the match in the 2–0 victory over Porto in the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. On 12 November, Neves scored the 94th minute equalizer in an eventual 2–1 league victory over rivals Sporting CP, at the Estádio da Luz; while also receiving the Man of the Match award. Over the following months, Neves established himself as one of the best midfielders in Portugal, being voted as the Primeira Liga's Midfielder of the Month between the months September and December, a feat which he repeated in February and March 2024, with only Braga's Rodrigo Zalazar winning it in January. At the end of the season, despite Benfica finishing as runners-up in the league, Neves was named in the Primeira Liga Team of the Year.
In July 2024, it was reported that Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) had made an initial bid for Neves of €70 million (£59 million). Their offer was rejected and negotiations continued, with Benfica being adamant that he would not be sold for less than his €120 million release clause, despite PSG agreeing personal terms with Neves. Shortly after, Benfica's President Rui Costa denied that he "would only leave for his release clause and therefore, those claims were false", but confirmed the club had received a bid for him, with negotiations between them and a club still proceeding. On 2 August, Rui Costa confirmed Neves' departure to Paris Saint-Germain, stating that he could not refuse a €70 million offer for him, leading Benfica to confirm his transfer three days later.


=== Paris Saint-Germain ===
On 5 August 2024, Neves signed a five-year contract with Paris Saint-Germain, for a €59.9 million fee plus €10 million in potential add-ons, and Renato Sanches moving in the other direction on a loan deal.
On 16 August, Neves made his official debut in a 4–1 win over Le Havre, coming on as a substitute and assisting Ousmane Dembélé and Bradley Barcola's goals. On 23 August, he again provided two assists, one each for Barcola and Marco Asensio, in a 6–0 victory over Montpellier. In the process, he set the record for the most assists (four) in his first two Ligue 1 matches, surpassing Neymar's previous record of three assists. On 27 October, Neves scored his first goal for the club, netting the opening goal in a 3–0 win at away over Le Classique rivals Marseille.


== International career ==
Neves represented Portugal at under-15 and under-19, for a total of 21 caps. In June 2023, Neves took part in the 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, scoring his first goal on 27 June in a 2–1 against Belgium. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament, on 2 July, after a 1–0 loss to England in the quarter-finals.
On 6 October 2023, Neves was called up to the Portuguese team for the first time for UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying matches against Slovakia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. He debuted the same year on 16 October, coming off the bench to replace Otávio in the 85th minute of a 5–0 away victory against Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 21 May 2024, Neves was selected in the 26-man squad for the UEFA Euro 2024. With Portugal having secured qualification from their group, he debuted in the competition as a starter in a 2–0 loss against Georgia. Neves did not appear in the knockout stage as they were eliminated from the tournament in the quarter-finals after losing to France 5–3 in a penalty shootout.


== Style of play ==
A footballer praised for his mature, highly developed mental attributes on the field since a young age, Neves is a quick, agile and technically gifted central midfielder, with notable passing and tackling skills, quick reactions, and close ball control. He is also known for his stamina, bravery and composure on the ball, as well as for his balance and the ability to retain possession in tight spaces when under pressure. In addition, despite his relatively slight frame, he ranks high on the percentile for aerial battles won.
Neves played as a deep-lying playmaker for Benfica, typically in a double pivot within a 4–2–3–1 formation, controlling possession by frequently dropping deep to receive the ball. His quick acceleration over short distances allows him to create space from his marker without needing deceptive moves. He is versatile, able to position himself between central defenders or a defender and full-back to create numerical advantages. His main strength is evading pressure using his agility and low center of gravity to spin away and accelerate into space. Neves also excels at counter-pressing, quickly engaging opponents to limit their time and space when possession is lost.
