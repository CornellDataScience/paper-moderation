Michael Jericho Sager (born February 5, 2003) is a Filipino-Canadian actor, model, dancer, singer and host. He is currently serving as one of the co-hosts in variety show All-Out Sundays.


== Life and career ==
Sager was born in Gasan, Marinduque. He migrated in Canada with his family, where he studied, first worked as an ice cream scooper and sales associate in a store.
His first television appearance was in a Disney Channel movie Descendants, as one of the backup dancers. Other than Disney, he was also an extra in films produced by Netflix and Nickelodeon.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sager attempted to audition for Pinoy Big Brother: Kumunity. As he flew back to the Philippines in 2022, he was supposed to audition for its teens edition, but at the same time, Sparkle GMA Artist Center formed a youth-oriented group of newest artists titled "Sparkada", eventually becoming one of the 17 members handpicked and discovered by star builder Johnny Manahan. Sager is introduced in the musical-comedy variety show All-Out Sundays.
He portrayed the role of Sean in the television series Luv Is: Caught In His Arms.
Sager is paired along with his fellow All-Out Sundays mainstay Zephanie, and later became a loveteam. Their first series together is #Frenemies, the first installment of youth-oriented anthology Sparkle U. They later reprised their respective roles in its third installment, #SoundTrip.
Months after the controversial departure of original hosts due to a dispute, Sager joined the TAPE Inc. iteration of longest-running noontime show Eat Bulaga! as one of the co-hosts in July 2023. He became part of an all-male group "Chaleco Boys", along with his fellow co-hosts Yasser Marta, Kokoy de Santos and Kimpoy Feliciano. The show was later renamed as Tahanang Pinakamasaya!, after TVJ won the copyright infringement case.
He marked his movie debut via Alden Richards and Julia Montes-led Five Breakups and a Romance, as part of the supporting cast.
In 2024, Sager is set to portray a role in Shining Inheritance, the Philippine adaptation of Korean drama Brilliant Legacy.
