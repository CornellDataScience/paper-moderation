Hysen Bytyqi (born 5 October 1968) is a Kosovo agricultural scientist who introduced animal breeding to Kosovo. He is professor of animal science and pro-rector of education and student matters at the University of Pristina


== Biography ==
Bytyqi was born on 5 October 1968 in Pristina. After studying agriculture, Bytyqi was in 1994 chairman of the regional Agricultural Society Malisheva which encompassed 45 communities and continued in this position until 1999. In parallel he studied at the Agricultural Faculty of Pristina University and obtained, in 1991, the Agricultural Diploma in animal science.
In 1999 and 2000 Bytyqi was the national representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as Kosovan consultant. He was responsible for the project "Agriculture 1998", and was involved in the planning and distribution of seed supplies and agricultural goods for 1400 farmers in Kosovo. From 2000 to 2003 Bytyqi was responsible for the project "Farm Reconstruction" (EFRP) in the same organisation (FAO), a million dollar project with the goal of providing farmers with livestock and machines, together with modern veterinary services, and to build up the administrative organisation after the war in Kosovo. In parallel Bytygi studied at the Agricultural University of Tirana  and in 2003 obtained his master's degree in animal breeding there.
