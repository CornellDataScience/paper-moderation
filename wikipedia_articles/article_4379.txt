== History ==
Ashikaga Station opened on 22 May 1888, as a station operated by the Ryomo Railway. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR) on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR East.
The station started accepting Suica cards on November 18, 2001. On 25 July 2008, the station building was struck by lightning, which caused damage to the second floor. In July 2015, the station and Ashikagashi Station adopted Chisato Moritaka's 1993 song "Watarasebashi" as their train melody, as the song pays homage to the town of Ashikaga. In February 2021, the pillar-mounted station name sign and the hanging station name sign where replaced with textile pattern designed signs to pay homage to the Ryōmō Line.
