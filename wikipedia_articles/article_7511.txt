The much-travelled Kaluđerović made his senior debut for OFK Beograd under manager Stevica Kuzmanovski, coming on as an injury-time substitute for Hristijan Kirovski in a 1–1 away league draw against Budućnost Banatski Dvor on 13 December 2003, aged 16. He spent the majority of the following three seasons on loan to various clubs, most notably Spartak Subotica in the Serbian First League. In the 2009 winter transfer window, Kaluđerović moved from OFK Beograd to fellow Serbian SuperLiga club Rad.

In August 2010, Kaluđerović signed a three-year contract with Red Star Belgrade. He was the league's joint top scorer in the 2010–11 season, alongside Ivica Iliev, with 13 goals. In February 2012, Kaluđerović was transferred to Chinese Super League club Beijing Guoan for an undisclosed fee.
In July 2013, Kaluđerović returned to Serbia and joined Vojvodina on a season-long loan. His loan was later transferred to Cypriot club AEL Limassol in January 2014.

On 29 January 2015, Brisbane Roar announced that they had acquired the services of the Serbian for the remainder of the 2014–15 A-League, with an option to an extension at the end of the season. Upon his arrival to the club, Kaluđerović said that it had been a desire of his to play in Australia for the Roar since facing them in the 2012 AFC Champions League, then with Beijing Guoan. He scored his first goal on his debut for the side in a 2–0 win over Central Coast Mariners. On 30 May 2015, Kaluđerović was released by new manager John Aloisi as his contract expired.


=== Wellington Phoenix ===
On 15 August 2017, it was announced that Kaluđerović would be returning to the A-League to play for the Wellington Phoenix on a one-year deal. He was the team's top scorer in the 2017–18 season with nine goals.

In April 2010, Kaluđerović made his full international debut for Serbia in a friendly match against Japan. He received his second call-up to the team for two friendlies against Mexico and Honduras in November 2011, appearing in both games with the latter ending up as his final international.
