The highway continues from Cross Plains eastward through eastern Callahan County and connects in Eastland County with SH 36. After a 0.5-mile (0.8 km) gap at SH 36, FM 374 continues east to Pioneer, Texas.

== History ==
The FM 374 designation was first used on June 25, 1945 for a road running from SH 199 in Megargel to a point 6.6 miles (10.6 km) to the northeast in Archer County. On May 23, 1951, FM 374 was extended northeast to SH 25 west of Archer City, with the portion of the extension from 4.9 miles west of SH 25 to SH 25 replacing FM 1196. The highway was extended 2.6 miles (4.2 km) south of Megargel on January 23, 1953. On October 28, 1953, the highway was extended southwest to the Young County line. The FM 374 designation was removed from this routing on December 10, 1953, as it was replaced by FM 210. On September 27, 1954, the current FM 374 was designated to run from FM 880 (now SH 206) in Cross Plains east to SH 36, replacing a former routing of SH 36. On September 5, 1973, FM 374 was designated onto the road connecting SH 36 to FM 569.
