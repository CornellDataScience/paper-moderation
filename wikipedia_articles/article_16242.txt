== Background ==
For the film's score, Singer approached John Williams to compose music, but turned down the offer as his schedule conflicted with that of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002). Singer then set on his usual composer, John Ottman. However, once Fox pushed X-Men from December to July, Ottman's commitment to direct Urban Legends: Final Cut made him unable to work with Singer. Later, Michael Kamen was eventually hired for the film.
As Kamen was not familiar with the comics, he only tried to "represent Bryan Singer's filmic tone that he's made, for a comic book, a quite serious movie, which is about the capacity of humanity to categorize people by race, religion or type, and prejudice people against them based on their innate characteristics". Character-specific themes were written to "identify these characters, as you go through the film, because they're not always clear". For instance, Mystique's motif, focused on the cello as Kamen found it "a very erotic-sounding instrument", played in the soundtrack as she was disguised as Wolverine. He initially planned to record the score first in London, but due to time restrictions, the recording was held in Los Angeles instead.
Kamen's first draft of the score had been described as having an abundance of themes and rich orchestrations. During early recording sessions, producer Lauren Shuler Donner expressed her dissatisfaction with Kamen's music and forced him to rewrite the entire score by using fewer themes and more electronic elements.

== Reception ==
James Southall of Movie Wave commented "Exploring the score reveals it has surprising depth – including a surprising thematic depth, with Kamen taking an unheralded leitmotivic approach to the score – motifs, sometimes just tiny little fragments, are heard throughout the album in different guises." Steven McDonald of AllMusic wrote " the score would have benefited from the absence of most of the electronic elements, which serve only to jar the viewer/listener out of the moment".  Filmtracks.com critiqued the score saying "the score requires patience and an acceptance of Kamen's extremely dark treatment of the concept" while the sequels (X2 and The Last Stand) scored by John Ottman and John Powell were "superior efforts that provide the concept with better themes and far more engaging action material".
