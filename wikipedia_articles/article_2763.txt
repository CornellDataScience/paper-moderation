She has served as the past Chair for Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) for a three-year term 2019-2021.


== Education ==
Mukherjee was born and raised in Kolkata, India. She received her B.Sc. in statistics from Presidency College in Kolkata in 1994 and her M.Stat from Indian Statistical Institute in 1996. At the completion of her M.Stat, The Ramakrishna Mission awarded her the Debesh-Kamal scholarship for studying abroad and Mukherjee moved to the United States, where she received her M.S. in mathematical statistics in 1999 and then her Ph.D. in statistics in 2001, both from Purdue University. Her advisor was William J. Studden and her thesis title was "Optimal designs for estimating the path of a stochastic process".


== Career ==
After completing her Ph.D., Mukherjee joined University of Florida as an assistant professor of Statistics and taught there until 2006, when she left to join the University of Michigan as the John G. Searle Assistant Professorship. In 2009, she became associate professor and in 2013, full professor. She was awarded the John D. Kalbfleisch Collegiate Professorship at the University of Michigan in 2015. She was appointed the associate chair of Department of Biostatistics at University of Michigan in 2014 and became the first woman chair of the department in 2018.
In 2016, Mukherjee was appointed the associate director of cancer control and population studies at University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, where she led the Cancer Center's research on cancer screening, epidemiology and prevention, as well as research on cancer outcomes, disparities and new models of cancer care delivery. After 4 years in this role she transitioned as the newly appointed associate director for Quantitative Data Sciences in 2020.
Mukherjee was the founding director of a cross-disciplinary summer institute at the School of Public Health to train undergraduates at the intersection of big data and human health. This program has trained 357 undergraduate students from 2015-2024. Mukherjee has served as the cohort development core co-director in the University of Michigan's Precision Health Initiative and leads the Center for Precision Health Data Science. In 2023, she was appointed as the inaugural Assistant Vice President of Research-Research Data Strategy to strengthen data analysis infrastructure across the University of Michigan.
Mukherjee was the statistics editor for the American Journal of Preventive Medicine from 2013 to 2014, an Associate Editor of Statistics in Medicine from 2015 to 2018, and an Associate Editor of Biometrics from 2008 to 2018. She has served on the editorial board of the Harvard Data Science Review and Genetic Epidemiology. She is currently an Associate Editor for Science Advances.


== Research and work ==
Mukherjee's research has primarily focused on the development and application of statistical methods in epidemiology, analysis of observational data and disease risk assessment. Her current interests include electronic health records, shrinkage methods, data integration, modeling of high dimensional exposure data and studies of gene-environment interaction. Her collaborations span in the areas of reproductive epidemiology, cancer epidemiology and environmental health. She has authored over 360 articles in scientific journals and has led several federally funded grants as principal investigator. Mukherjee is currently serving as one of the principal investigators of a large cohort building grant MI-CARES (Michigan Cancer and Research on the Environment Study), studying the impact of toxic exposures on cancer risks in Michigan residents.
One of the focal points of Mukherjee's research is to understand how the interaction between genes and environment increases or decreases cancer risk. In this area, she has studied how lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity coupled with the genetic makeup of an individual impact their cancer risk. She has also worked on developing models that use genetic data to predict which individuals have a higher cancer risk.  In 2018, Mukherjee and her colleagues conducted a phenome-wide association study to see if the polygenic risk scores for different cancers are associated with multiple phenotypes. Their study showed that polygenic risk scores can help in stratifying the risk of different cancers in patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mukherjee and her study team took an active role in modeling the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in India. This work received significant attention from the media  and from the scientific community.
