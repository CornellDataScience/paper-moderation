After leading the championship with four podiums including one win during his rookie season, Davies ended the 97 Championship in fourth position. The following two seasons contained flashes of speed including podiums at Oschersleben and Monaco but never quite the repeat success of his rookie year. 1998 also saw Davies return to the McLaren Formula One team for more testing duties.

He was due to race in the Snetterton rounds of the 1996 British Touring Car Championship in place of the injured Kelvin Burt at Volvo but a crash at the pre-meeting test ruled him out. He also tested a Production Class BMW 320i E46 for Edenbridge ahead of the 2002 Season but lost out on a potential race seat at the team to Norman Simon.
