== History ==
The school was founded in 1948 as a part of the UT Graduate School as the Graduate School of Library Science, offering a Master of Library Science (MLS) degree as well as certification for school librarianship, an offering which has been continually provided to this day. In 1967 the school initiated a Certificate of Advanced Study followed in 1969-70 by a doctoral program, leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
The school's name was changed in 1980 to Graduate School of Library and Information Science in recognition of the increased emphasis on information science in the curriculum as it had evolved since the late 1960s. At the same time, the name of the master's degree became Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS). Change has continued into this century with the master's degree name changed again to Master of Science in Information Studies (MSIS) in 2000. In 2002 the faculty voted unanimously to change the school name to School of Information. The new name took effect in 2003 to better reflect the diversity of issues and the multidisciplinary nature of the studies in the information field. The school is a founding member of the iCaucus.
