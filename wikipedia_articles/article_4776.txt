Cooper Snowfield (80°56′S 158°40′E) is a snowfield with an area of  about 25 square miles (65 km2) in the Churchill Mountains of Antarctica. 


== Location ==
The snowfield rises to over 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) and is nearly encircled by ridges connecting Mount Field, Mount Durnford, and Mount Liard.
It was named after Alan K. Cooper, a marine geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California, who was involved in drilling and seismic studies of the Antarctic continental margin for deriving paleoenvironments and ice sheet history, 1984–2002.


== Surrounding features ==

The snowfield is bordered by the Skinner Saddle to the east.
Surrounding mountains clockwise from the southeast are Mount Liard, Mount Stewart, Mount Durnford, Mount Field, Mount Hubble.


=== Mount Liard ===

A peak 6 nautical miles (11 km) east of Mount Durnford. It rises to 1,770 metres (5,800 ft) on the ridge south of Cooper Snowfield. The peak was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names after Theodore J. Liard, Jr. (1918–2002), a geographer with the Department of Interior and the Department of Defense in toponymic research for the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, 1949–80. Liard was Chief of the Geographic Names Division at the Defense Mapping Agency, 1969–80.


=== Mount Stewart ===

A mountain rising to 1,900 metres (6,200 ft), located mid way between Mount Durnford and Mount Liard. Named in honor of Ian Stewart, a retired diplomat, who was also the Whaling Commissioner for 12 years before John Scott and Jim McLay, setting the groundwork in place.


=== Mount Durnford ===
80°58′S 158°15′E. 
A mountain, 2,715 metres (8,907 ft) high, standing 5 miles (8.0 km) southeast of Mount Field. 
Discovered and named "Durnford Bluff by the BrNAE (1901-04), for Admiral Sir John Durnford, a Junior Naval Lord who was of assistance to the expedition.

=== Mount Hubble ===
80°52′S 158°19′E
A mountain rising to 2,490 metres (8,170 ft) between Mount Field and Mount Dick. It was named after American astronomer Edwin Hubble of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Mount Wilson Observatory, 1919–53; in 1923 he furnished the first certain evidence that extragalactic nebulae were situated far outside the boundaries of our own galaxy, in fact were independent stellar systems.


== Northern peaks ==
To the north of Mount Field and Mount Hubble are Mount Egerton, East Egerton, Mount Dick and Prior Cliff


=== Mount Egerton ===
80°50′S 157°55′E. 
A mountain, 2,830 metres (9,280 ft) high, rising 3 miles (4.8 km) north-north-west of Mount Field. 
Discovered by the BrNAE (1901-04) and named for Admiral Sir George Le Clerc Egerton, a member of the Arctic Expedition of 1875-76, one of Scott's advisors for this expedition.


=== East Egerton ===

A prominent peak, 2,815 metres (9,236 ft) high, rising 2 miles (3.2 km) east of Mount Egerton. 
Mapped by the NZGSAE (1960-61) and named in association with Mount Egerton.


=== Mount Dick ===
