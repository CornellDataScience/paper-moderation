She also served as the first Raja Permaisuri Agong of Malaya between 1957 and 1960.
Tunku Kurshiah's sister, Tunku Durah married her stepson Tuanku Munawir Ibni Al-Marhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman and succeeded her as Tunku Ampuan Besar in 1960.


== Early life ==
Born on 16 May 1911 in Seri Menanti, Negeri Sembilan, she was the eldest daughter of Tunku Besar Burhanuddin ibni Almarhum Tuanku Antah (sometime Regent of Negeri Sembilan). She received her early education at the Seri Menanti Malay School. She also attended private English classes.


== Becoming Queen ==
Tuanku Kurshiah married Tuanku Abdul Rahman ibni Almarhum Tuanku Muhammad, the ruler of Negeri Sembilan as his third wife on 21 May 1929. They had two daughters; Tuanku Bahiyah, who became Sultanah of Kedah and Tunku Shahariah, who became the wife of Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Tunku Bendahara of Johor.
Upon her husband's accession to the throne of Negeri Sembilan in 1933, Tunku Kurshiah was proclaimed Tunku Ampuan Besar or Queen Consort of Negeri Sembilan.
In 1957, her husband was elected as the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong of independent Malaya (later Malaysia) and she became the first Raja Permaisuri Agong or Queen.
Tuanku Abdul Rahman died in April 1960 and Tunku Kurshiah was given the title of Tunku Puan Besar of Negeri Sembilan.
