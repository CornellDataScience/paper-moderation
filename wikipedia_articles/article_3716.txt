== History ==


=== Foundation ===
Wanderu was founded in February 2012 by Igor Bratnikov and Polina Raygorodskaya while they were part of GreenXC, an organization intended to raise awareness for national parks and forests throughout the United States. The pair met while they were teenagers at a Russian-language after-school program. They conceived of the idea after a ride share cancelled on them and they had a difficult time finding a bus. Craig Lentzsch, former CEO of Greyhound, became an advisor to the company.
The company gained 20,000 user sign-ups while in beta. On August 12, 2013, Wanderu.com officially launched to the public, covering bus, train travel, and ferries within the Northeastern United States.


=== Growth in North America ===
In August 2013, the company raised $2.45 million in a funding round led by Alta Ventures. Investors included Jeff Clarke, chairman of Orbitz. At the time, the company had partnerships with companies such as BoltBus, Go Buses, Concord Coach Lines, and Trailways of New York.

Wanderu is an aggregator that allows travelers to find and compare bus, train, and flight options all in the same search. After selecting start and end points and date and time preferences, Wanderu's search engine generates listings which can be filtered by price, duration, and other amenities like access to WiFi. The user is then redirected to the provider's website for booking.
