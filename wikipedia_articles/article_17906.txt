MZKT (МЗКТ or МЗКЦ, Belarusian: Мінскі завод колавых цягачоў, Russian: Минский завод колёсных тягачей, Minsk Wheel(ed) Tractor Plant (MWTP)) is a manufacturer of heavy off-road vehicles, especially military trucks, based in Minsk, in Belarus; it was formerly a division of MAZ. MZKT civilian trucks are branded VOLAT (Belarusian: волат, literally means Giant). MZKT specializes in the production of on-road and off-road heavy-duty vehicles and trailers for them, as well as special wheeled chassis for installation of various equipment for enterprises and transport organizations of the construction, oil and gas and engineering industries.


== History ==

In 1954, MZKT, the Minsk Wheeled Tractor Plant, was founded to develop artillery tractors; it then developed a series of heavy weapons transporters for the military of the USSR, including heavy offroad trucks such as the MAZ-537 and MAZ-7310. It was a division of Minsk Automobile Plant (known as MAZ). In 1991, MZKT was spun off into a separate company; its former parent, MAZ, continues to make a broader range of heavy vehicles.
In 1992, military orders slowed, and MZKT attempted to adapt its products to civilian uses, such as mining trucks and crane carriers.
In 2020 it was said that the MZKT was the primary supplier for the chassis of such Russian army vehicles as the launcher for the Topol-M because the domestic Russian products are of comparatively low quality.


== Products ==
Many post-independence MZKT trucks continued to use a MAZ cab which resembled the Iveco Turbostar cab; starting in 2010 these were replaced with Belkarplastik cabs which resembled the 5th generation Isuzu Forward, which are also used by Yarovit trucks. The civilian brand of the group Volat manufacturers tractor trucks, ballast tractors and trailers for transportation and commercial use.
