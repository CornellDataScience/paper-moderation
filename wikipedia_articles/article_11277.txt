== History ==
The school was founded in 1931 as a joint effort between The University of Denver's Department of Allied Social Services and community agencies such as Community Chest and the Denver chapter of the American Association of Social Workers (which later became National Association of Social Workers).  Continuously accredited by the  American Association of Professional Schools of Social Work since 1933, the program became known as the Graduate School of Social Work in 1942. In 1968, the school established one of the first doctoral programs in social work.   In 2006, the Institute for Human Animal Connection was founded, the first institute of its type housed within a school of social work.
