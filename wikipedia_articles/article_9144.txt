The 11th Air Control Wing is an inactive unit of the United States Air Force, last stationed at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. It was assigned to the Pacific Air Forces' Eleventh Air Force and was inactivated in 1994.
The wing was activated on 21 June 1948 as the 531st Air Control and Warning Group at McChord Air Force Base, part of the Fourth Air Force. The 626th and 632d Air Control and Warning Squadrons were assigned to the group. Around 25 October 1948, it became part of the 25th Air Division. On 15 July 1949, the group transferred to Elmendorf Air Force Base, where it had remained ever since. The 625th Air Control and Warning Squadron became part of the group on the same day. The group became part of Alaskan Air Command three days before. On 1 June 1950, the group was inactivated. The group was activated again on 17 November 1950 with the 10th Air Division, less the 632d Squadron. It became part of Alaskan Air Command again on 20 July 1951, but was transferred back to the 10th Air Division on 1 November 1952. On 8 December of that year, the 705th, 717th, 719th, 794th, and 795th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadrons joined the group. The group was inactivated on 15 April 1953.

The 3d Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS)  became part of the group on the same day. On 1 November 1983, the group's aircraft control and warning squadrons were inactivated.
