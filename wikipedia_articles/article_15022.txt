The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos are the intercollegiate athletic teams representing the University of California, Santa Barbara. Referred to in athletic competition as UC Santa Barbara or UCSB, the Gauchos participate in 19 NCAA Division I intercollegiate sports with the majority competing in the Big West Conference. UCSB currently fields varsity teams in 10 men's and 9 women's sports.
Throughout the school's history, UCSB has won team national championships for 1979 men's water polo, 2006 men's soccer and 1962 men's swimming and diving (Div. II). The Gauchos, and the student-athletes who compose the teams, have won a variety of conference titles, regularly compete in NCAA championship events, and have produced professional and Olympic athletes.
The school has played a pivotal role in the collegiate athletics landscape in California. UCSB was a founding member of the California Collegiate Athletic Association, the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (now known as the Big West Conference), and the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.


== Nickname ==
Those affiliated with UCSB, including alumni, faculty, and students in addition to the athletic teams, have previously gone under the nicknames Hilltoppers and Roadrunners. In September 1934, the student body voted to change the Roadrunners moniker to the Gauchos, which also applied to the athletic teams. Students felt the name more suited the campus's and Santa Barbara, California-area's Spanish architecture, Mission Santa Barbara, and the Gaucho was "essentially Spanish". The school marked the change with a small ceremony of four horse-riders before a football game's kickoff. Later, others attributed the change as inspired by Douglas Fairbanks' role in the eponymous film, The Gaucho.


== History ==
The earliest teams representing UC Santa Barbara, then known as Santa Barbara State Teachers College, appeared in the 1920s with football and basketball followed shortly by baseball.
UCSB was one of four founding members of the California Collegiate Athletic Association, which first took place during the 1938–39 school year. The association sponsored 10 sports and served as a catalyst for UCSB to elevate sports previously classified as "minor" to equal standing as "major", which provided a level playing field for all UCSB-sponsored teams.
In 1969, UC Santa Barbara was a founding member of the Big West Conference, then known as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association.
Along with a consortium of teams from the Big West Conference, Western Athletic Conference, and Pac-10 Conference, UC Santa Barbara was a founding member of the regional Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in 1992.

=== Baseball ===

Potentially one of the oldest teams the Gauchos field, baseball can date back to at least 1922. The first known head coach is Kenneth Bolton, who coached in only the 1922 season before handing the reins to O. J. Gilliland in 1923. The Gauchos have appeared in 13 NCAA Division I baseball tournaments.
Numerous Major League Baseball all-stars and World Series champions have come through the ranks including Shane Bieber, Skip Schumaker, Chris Speier, Michael Young, and Barry Zito.


=== Basketball ===
Both the UCSB men's and women's basketball teams play at the UCSB Events Center, commonly known as the Thunderdome.


==== Men's basketball ====

UCSB Men's Basketball had its best years in the late '80s and early '90s under coach Jerry Pimm, highlighted by a 77–70 victory over then No. 2 and eventual National Champion UNLV in 1990, and NCAA tournament appearances in 1988 (lost to Maryland) and 1990 (defeated Houston 70–66 and lost to Michigan State 62–58). The Gauchos returned to the NCAA tournament in 2002 where they nearly upset powerhouse Arizona in the opening round. Over the years, a few of Pimm's assistants at UCSB have gone on to coach other major programs around the country, including Ben Howland (1982–1994) of UCLA and Jamie Dixon of Pittsburgh.
In the 2009–10 season, UCSB Men's Basketball was the regular season champion and final tournament champion in the Big West Conference, defeating Long Beach State. It won an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament and played 2nd seed Ohio State, losing to the Buckeyes. In 2010–2011, they placed fifth in the regular season. They defeated Long Beach State in the tournament final for the second year in a row. The Gauchos were the lowest seed to win the Big West Tournament since sixth-seeded San Jose State toppled Utah State in 1996. They played the 2nd seed Florida Gators and lost. It was the first time UCSB entered an NCAA Tournament in back-to-back seasons.
Famous Gauchos men's basketball players are Brian Shaw, Conner Henry, Alex Harris, Lucius Davis, Don Ford, James Nunnally, and Orlando Johnson.


==== Women's basketball ====

In 2005, UCSB Women's Basketball won its unprecedented ninth straight Big West Conference Championship. The team had its best year in history during the 2004 season when it advanced to the NCAA Sweet 16 where it lost to eventual champion UConn. UCSB was the only team to hold UConn to less than a double-digit victory in the NCAA playoffs. From 2000 to 2005, Tasha McDowell served as an assistant coach.
In the 2012 Big West Tournament, the UCSB women's basketball team became the first 6th seed to win the tournament. In the first round, the team traveled to UC Irvine and defeated the 3rd-seeded Anteaters 61–51. The Gauchos continued on their playoff march against the Pacific Tigers in the semifinals hosted at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA. Pacific swept UCSB in the regular season, but the Gauchos were victorious when it mattered the most as they bounced the Tigers out of the tournament with an overwhelming 84-66 decision. The 84-point output currently stands as the most points the Gauchos have scored under head coach Carlene Mitchell. After defeating the number 3 seed and number 5 seed, the Gauchos ended up being the higher-ranked team in the championship game as they were set to face Long Beach State who pulled off two miraculous upsets of their own as the 7 seed. The Gauchos went on to capture its record 14th Big West crown with a 63–54 final tally. Gaucho center Kirsten Tilleman had a double-double (16 points and 11 rebounds) against the 49ers, which earned her the tournament MVP honors. She was also included on the All-Tournament team roster along with her teammate sophomore guard Melissa Zornig, who averaged 16.7 points per game in the tournament. The 2011-2012 Gauchos' season ended in the first round of the NCAA tournament where they fell 81–40 against the eventual national champion Baylor.

Wilson posted a dual meet record of 292–208–1 (172–115 with the men, 120–92–1 with the women). Even more impressive, his squads have collected 36 Big West Conference Championships, 23 by his men's teams and 13 by his women's teams. Before the Texas Longhorns men's swim team broke it, the UCSB men's swim team set the NCAA record for most consecutive conference titles in any sport with 23 straight Big West Conference championships from 1979 to 2001. The men's teams have been ranked as high as 16th nationally and several of his swimmers over the years have advanced to the NCAA Championships. The men's team has turned in 38 All-American performances under Wilson.
The team is now led by Coach Matt Macedo, who took over the position in August 2016 (was an assistant coach for two years prior). The men's team earned back-to-back championship titles at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championship (MPSF) in 2017 and 2018, while Macedo also earned the coach of the year award in his first year.

== Former varsity sports ==


=== Football ===

UCSB began playing intercollegiate football in 1921, playing as the "Roadrunners" on a field at Pershing Park. Theodore "Spud" Harder became coach in 1934; in the same year, the school adopted a new name, selecting "Gauchos" in a student vote. The 1936 team finished with a 9–1 record, the best in school history, and two of its members later played for the NFL's New York Giants.
La Playa Stadium, now used by Santa Barbara City College, opened in 1938 and was the team's home until 1966, when Harder Stadium was built.
"Cactus Jack" Curtice, who had been head coach at several major college programs, coached the team from 1963 to 1969. His 1965 team finished 8-1 and went to the Camellia Bowl. Under Curtice's successor, Andy Everest, the college decided to launch an NCAA Division I program, but after two seasons of dismal on-field performance and a lack of student support, the college changed directions and decided to drop the sport entirely in December 1971 after falling $40,000 below its estimated operating budget.
The Gauchos appeared in four bowl games during 50 years, winning only once, in the 1948 Potato Bowl.


==== UCSB football Division I era significant events ====
In 1930, UCSB finished 6–1–1. Overall, the team outscored its opponents 97–51 for the season.
In 1936, the Gauchos finished the season with a record of 9–1, including 4–1 in the SCIAC, with the only blemish a one-point loss to league champion San Diego State. Overall, the team outscored its opponents 223–43 for the season. The Gauchos had five shutouts and held the other team to a touchdown or less in 8 of 10 games.
In 1948, UCSB finished the season 6–5, including 2–3 in the CCAA. At the end of the season, the Gauchos played in the first Potato Bowl, in Bakersfield, California. The Gauchos were Potato Bowl Champions versus Willamette University, 46–7.
In 1950, the Gauchos finished 7–3 overall and 3–1 in the CCAA.
In 1952, UCSB went 8–2 overall and 3–1 against the CCAA.
In 1956, the Gauchos finished the season 5–5 overall and 1–1 in the CCAA. The Gauchos accepted an invitation to play in a charity bowl game. The game was the first and only Citricado Bowl, played at Escondido High School in Escondido, California against a military team from Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, which they lost 25–16 to the San Diego Marines.
In 1957, the Gauchos finished the season with a record of 6–2 overall, including 1–1 in the CCAA.
In 1964, UCSB went 4–7. For the season, they were outscored by their opponents 164–152. They played in an unsanctioned Aztec Bowl in Mexico City against a Mexican All-Star Team and lost 20–7.
In 1965, the Gauchos finished the regular season 8–1. At the end of the season, the Gauchos qualified for a postseason bowl game, the 1965 Camellia Bowl, played in Sacramento, California. They lost the game against Cal State Los Angeles 18–10. That brought their final record to 8–2. For the 1965 season, they outscored their opponents 225–95. Jack Curtice won the AFCA Coach of the Year in Division II.


===== Brief revival at Division III and Division II levels =====
In 1987, the Gauchos competed as a Division III football independent and compiled a record of 8–2, and outscored their opponents 237–107.
In 1989, led by Mike Warren in his fourth and final season as head coach, the Gauchos compiled a record of 8–2 and outscored their opponents 313–150. The team again played as a D-III independent. Looming NCAA legislation, however, mandated that universities' athletic programs must all compete at the same divisional level. Warren finished his four-year stint as head coach with a record of 26–13 for a winning percentage of .667.
A student-run club team started play in 1983, and in 1985 a student referendum approved funding for a Division III, non-scholarship team on a $65,000 budget. The team began play in 1987 and enjoyed some success on the field, with a 33–15 record from 1987 to 1991.
In 1991, UCSB football moved up to Division II, with students paying $1 per quarter to generate a budget of $80,000 for the team. However, soon after in 1992, the NCAA decided to officially forbid schools playing in Division I in other sports from maintaining a lower-level football program, and UCSB dropped the sport again. The final outcome came in February 1992, as students voted by a margin of 54.1 percent (3,644) to 45.9 percent (3,089) against implementing a potential $9-per-quarter fee increase which would've enabled the football team to play at the Division I-AA (today known as FCS) level.
