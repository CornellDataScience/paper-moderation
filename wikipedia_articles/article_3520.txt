Wallace Jacob Dallenbach (December 12, 1936 – April 29, 2024) was an American racing driver and official. He competed primarily in United States Auto Club (USAC) sanctioned Championship cars, and was the winner of the 1973 California 500. After retiring from driving, he served for more than 20 years as Chief Steward of Competition for Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). 
Dallenbach was the father of NASCAR driver and commentator, Wallace Paul Dallenbach. After the younger Dallenbach began a professional racing career during the middle 1980s, the elder Dallenbach came to be known by the retronym Dallenbach Sr.


== Biography ==
Dallenbach was born in East Brunswick, New Jersey. After working in the construction industry, he began his racing career in modified racing. In 1962, he competed in the Daytona 500. He eventually settled on open-wheel racing, competing in midget and sprint cars before moving to Indy cars in 1965.


=== Indy car career ===
After several years competing in uncompetitive equipment, Dallenbach's breakthrough came after being signed by team owner Pat Patrick to replace driver Swede Savage, badly injured during the 1973 Indianapolis 500. After Savage's death, Dallenbach's seat became permanent. Four races into his tenure with Patrick's team, Dallenbach scored his first victory, the Tony Bettenhausen 200 at the Milwaukee Mile. He scored two further victories in 1973, including the California 500. Despite not starting in four races during the 1973 season, Dallenbach finished the 1973 USAC Championship Car season ranked second in points.
Dallenbach nearly won the 1975 Indianapolis 500, dueling with A. J. Foyt for many laps. He led for half of the race, but burned a piston on lap 162, twelve laps before the race was called due to rain. Bobby Unser won the race, which was halted at lap 174 (435 miles).


=== CART official ===
Dallenbach joined CART as Competition Director in 1980 and became Chief Steward of the series in 1981. Under his tenure, he greatly improved the safety program in CART, the preeminent sanctioning body of Indy car racing. He played an instrumental role in establishing the first dedicated rapid response trauma team in auto racing. He also established nondenominational church services for drivers and their families. Dallenbach held his position until the end of the 2000 season, after which he went into semi-retirement, serving as Special Advisor to CART and Chris Kneifel, his successor as Chief Steward.
Advance testing and practice in preparation for the 2001 Firestone Firehawk 600 – to be held at Texas Motor Speedway (TMS) – saw numerous drivers black out due to unprecedented g-forces experienced at the track. Dallenbach had visited TMS as early as 1996, deeming it unsafe for Indy car competition. On the day of the race, despite pressure from stakeholders within the CART community to proceed with the event, it was decided to cancel to event in order to ensure the safety of the competitors.
Shortly thereafter, Dallenbach returned as Chief Steward for CART, replacing Kneifel, who had been the subject of criticism from many drivers. Dallenbach served until the conclusion of the 2004 season, after which he retired permanently.


=== Post-racing activities ===
Dallenbach served as the president of the Colorado 500 motorcycle charity ride. The events have raised just under three million dollars in community support - including more than $800,000 in student scholarships - for the town of Basalt, Colorado, located in the Roaring Fork Valley region of western Colorado.
With his winnings from the California 500, Dallenbach purchased a ranch, fairground, cabins and a private automotive restoration garage near the Fryingpan River in upper Basalt. In 2023, he sold the property, returning with his wife to New Jersey. During their time in Colorado, the couple supported the development of local emergency services in the area; in 1976, Dallenbach purchased an ambulance for the town of Basalt.
Dallenbach died on April 29, 2024, at the age of 87.

In 1972, Dallenbach was bumped on the final day of time trials. Art Pollard crashed his qualified car on May 16, and was too injured to drive on race day. Dallenbach was hired to fill the seat, and the car was moved to 33rd starting position.
