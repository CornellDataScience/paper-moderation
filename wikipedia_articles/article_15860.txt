The Satellite Sisters is an internet-based podcast that originated as a syndicated radio program broadcast on Public Radio International and ABC News & Talk (via ABC Radio Networks). The program first aired on Public Radio International in 2000; A year after its launch, it was syndicated on 70 radio stations. The show revolves around five real-life sisters living in different cities. Its premise is that the sisters "get together" via satellite to talk as if they were going to meet in person or talk on the phone. The sisters typically rotate hosting duties, and the show most often is co-hosted by three of the five sisters simultaneously.
The show received the Gracie Award for Outstanding Comedy in 2008 and for Outstanding Podcast in 2009, awarded by American Women in Radio and Television.
ABC Radio ceased its syndication of the show on November 9, 2008, and the show transformed into an internet-based podcast, with weekly episodes available on Spotify and Apple podcasts.
The Sisters have written a book called Uncommon Senses. Published by Riverhead Books in 2001, the book is a collection of short stories about the Dolan sisters' lives growing up in Fairfield, Connecticut. The sisters post the podcast readings. The Satellite Sisters released a second book called You're the Best: A Celebration of Friendship in October 2015, published by Prospect Park Books.
There is also an internet community radio station named BSIDE Radio in Vancouver, Canada, that hosts a radio program that is also hosted as a podcast called Satellite Sisters on Bside Radio. This program/podcast showcases "Bassmusic" tracks produced by women and plays a mixed set by a woman DJ in every episode.
