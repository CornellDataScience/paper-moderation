Soeste is a river in the Cloppenburg district in Lower Saxony, Germany, a tributary of the Ems.
The Soeste forms from two source brooks in Hesselnfeld and Egterholz, two small settlements in the Emstek municipality. It flows northwest through Cloppenburg, where its water flow is already sufficient for water mills to be operated im former times. The Soeste flows into a dam at Thülsfelde (Thülsfelder Talsperre), which was built in the 1920s. From there it flows through the towns Friesoythe and Barßel. West of the latter town, the Soeste flows into the Jümme, which drains into the Ems.

The Soeste River, located in the Cloppenburg district of Lower Saxony, Germany, is a significant tributary of the Ems River. It has a crucial role in shaping the landscape of the region and has influenced local industries and settlements throughout its history.

The Soeste originates from two humble source brooks in Hesselnfeld and Egterholz, both tiny settlements within the Emstek municipality1. From there, it charts a course northwest, cutting through the picturesque landscapes of Lower Saxony.

An important waypoint along the river's course is the town of Cloppenburg2. Historically, the river's flow here was sufficiently robust to power water mills, a testament to its vitality and contribution to early industrial activities in the region. These water mills were crucial for the development of local agriculture and industry, underscoring the Soeste's economic significance.

The river continues its journey into a dam at Thülsfelde, known as Thülsfelder Talsperre3. This dam, constructed in the 1920s, serves multiple purposes, including flood control, power generation, and recreation, further highlighting the river's role in the region's infrastructure.

From Thülsfelde, the Soeste meanders through the towns of Friesoythe and Barßel, providing scenic views and contributing to the local ecosystems along its path4. Finally, west of Barßel, the Soeste converges with the Jümme River, which eventually drains into the Ems5.

Overall, the Soeste River's journey from its humble beginnings to its ultimate confluence with the Jümme serves as an illustrative narrative of the natural, industrial, and cultural landscapes of Lower Saxony.
