Its main fundraiser, the RTÉ People in Need Telethon, was broadcast by RTÉ from 1989 until 2007 and supported by Eircom (formerly Telecom Éireann), raising more than €35 million in total. The theme tune was "Come On Everybody" by Eddie Cochran. As with The Late Late Toy Show, Gay Byrne presented it wearing distinctive knitted jumpers.
