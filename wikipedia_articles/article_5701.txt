Sphaeralcea ambigua, is a species of flowering plant commonly known as desert globemallow or apricot mallow, for its predominantly orange blooms. It has fuzzy grey-green leaves. It is a member of the genus Sphaeralcea in the mallow family (Malvaceae).
It is a perennial shrub native to the southwest United States and northwest Mexico. S. ambigua is a prevalent species in desert habitat and helps provide food and habitat for other species
One of it's main use is in native, pollinator, or drought tolerant gardens. but it is also used by the Shoshoni peoples as a medicinal plant and as a buffer against invasive species.  


== Description ==
Sphaeralcea ambigua grows to 3 feet (0.91 m) in height and spreads to 2–3 feet (0.61–0.91 m) in width. The leaves (see image) are fuzzy with white hairs on both sides, lobed, palmately veined, and on long stems, the number of which increase with age. The fruit is a brown capsule containing numerous seeds, first quite spherical as implied by the genus name, later flattening to a disk.  The flowers are bowl-shaped, five-petaled, apricot to orange in color (although morphs may be white or light pink), and blooming in the spring.
S. ambigua is also a larval host to several species of butterfly, such as the common checkered skipper, northern white skipper, painted lady, small checkered skipper, and West Coast lady.


=== Varieties ===
Sphaeralcea ambigua has eight or nine named varieties. They include:

Sphaeralcea ambigua A. Gray var. ambigua 
Sphaeralcea ambigua A. Gray var. aculeata Jeps. (synonym for S. a. var. ambigua) 
Sphaeralcea ambigua A. Gray var. rosacea (Munz & I.M. Johnst.) Kearney 
Sphaeralcea ambigua A. Gray var. rugosa (Kearney) Kearney 


== Habitat ==


=== Native Habitat ===
Desert Globemallow is native to parts of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico in the United States and Sonora and Baja California in northwest Mexico.It grows well in alkaline soil, both sandy and clay, usually in the company of creosote bush scrub and desert chaparral habitats, at 150–2,500 metres (490–8,200 ft) in elevation. It is found in the Mojave Desert, Great Basin desert, and Sonoran Desert ecoregions. 


=== Cultivation ===
Sphaeralcea ambigua is cultivated as an ornamental plant by specialty plant nurseries for use in desert and drought tolerant gardens, and a native plant its desert region's natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects. It requires full sun and can do well with natural rainfall, although supplemental watering will increase flowering. Sandy, desert soil with good drainage is preferred but it is tolerant of some clay. It is winter hardy in USDA Zones 6–10, withstanding temperatures as low as -10F. General maintenance is low. May be periodically cut back to maintain a vegetative look. Propagation is easy by seed but tricky by vegetative cuttings.


== Uses ==


=== Native Peoples Use ===
The plant is used by members of the Shoshoni tribe of Native Americans, as well as other Indigenous people and settlers in the region, as a food source and medicinal plant.


=== Against Invasive Species ===
Sphaeralcea ambigua has been proven as a good combatant to invasive species (such as cheatgrass) where S. ambigua is a native plant. This is partially due to globemallow being a relatively fast grower with widespread populations.
