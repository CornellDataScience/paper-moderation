The Baluarte Bridge held the record for the highest cable-stayed bridge in the world when it was inaugurated in 2012 with a maximum drop from the surface of the deck to the bottom of the Baluarte River of 403 metres (1,322 ft), according to the Guinness World Records, however, some diagrams of the bridge show a height of 390 metres (1,280 ft) between the axis of the central span and the river, the bridge having a regular slope of 5%. Its clearance is largely higher than that of the previous record-holder, France's Millau Viaduct, which has a clearance of 270 metres (890 ft) but it was beaten by the 565 metres (1,854 ft) high Duge Bridge in China, opened in 2016.
This table presents a non-exhaustive list of the road and railway bridges with spans greater than 100 metres (328 ft) or total lengths longer than 3,000 metres (9,843 ft).
