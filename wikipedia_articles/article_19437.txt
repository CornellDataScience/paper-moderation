First Provincial Legislative Council election was held in Punjab in 1920 as mandated by the Government of India Act 1919.


== Introduction ==
The First World War gave the momentum to the growing demand for self-government in British India. Therefore, the new constitutional reforms, under the Montaguâ€“Chelmsford Reforms were introduced by British Government. The scheme was implemented through the Government of India Act 1919. The first Council was constituted on 8 January 1921 for the first time. The election for first Council was held in December 1920. 71 members were elected and 22 were nominated by Governor.
In 1920 the election was not contested on Party lines thus all elected candidates considered as Independent.
The term of the council was fixed for three years. The council, for first time, was presided by a nominated person designated as President and in his absence, an elected person designated as Deputy President.
The first election which was conducted in the house was of Deputy President between Mehtab Singh and Chaudhary M. Amin. Mehtab Singh won election by securing 48 votes, while Amin secured 37 Votes.
The First Council had held 98 meetings when the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab dissolved the council on 27 October 1923 after completion of three years tenure.
