== Critical reception ==

The Los Angeles Times wrote that "there's modest warmth rather than roaring fire from the Eagles' bassist, whose first solo album in 11 years is steeped in '70s R&B- tinged classic rock a' la you know who." The Birmingham Mail called the album "easy on the ear, country-flavoured soft-rock which sounds great on the open road with the top down and the wind in your hair." The Sacramento Bee deemed it "a solid showcase for Schmit's musical talents, from svelte vocal harmonies to polished songwriting."
