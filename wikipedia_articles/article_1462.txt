The Voice Sakartvelo (Georgian: The Voice საქართველო), known in English as The Voice Georgia, is a Georgian reality television show and singing competition broadcast on 1TV.
From seasons one through three, the show was called The Voice of Georgia (Georgian: ახალი ქართული ხმა, Akhali Kartuli Khma, lit. 'New Georgian Voice') and was broadcast on IMEDI TV. It is part of the international franchise The Voice based on the reality singing competition, The Voice of Holland, launched in the Netherlands, created by Dutch television producer John de Mol.
One of the show's important premises is the contestants' singing quality. Three or four coaches, themselves popular performing artists, composers, and producers, train talents in their team and occasionally perform with them. Talents are selected in blind auditions, where the coaches cannot see, but only hear the auditioner.


== History ==
The first season kicked off on 4 October 2012 and finished on 13 January 2013. The winner of the first season was Salome Katamadze with 48.6% of the votes. She was awarded a trip to Los Angeles, California to record a single at Universal Music Studio.
In 2013, IMEDI TV produced a kids' version of the show titled Akhali Sabavsho Khma (Georgian: ახალი საბავშო ხმა, lit. 'New Kids' Voice'). The coaches were Dato Porchkhidze, Eka Kakhiani, and Stephane Mgebrishvili, with Samory Balde and Ruska Makashvili as the presenters.
Starting in 2021, the show was rebooted by the Georgian Public Broadcaster for the channel 1TV. It was used to select the Georgian representative for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023.


== Format ==
The show consists of three phases: blind auditions, battles phase, and live performance shows. Four coaches, all noteworthy recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each coach has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute and a half) to decide if they want that performer on their team; if two or more coaches want the same performer (as happens frequently), the performer has the final choice of which coach's team to join.
After each coach fills every slot in their team, the batch of singers in the team is mentored and developed by their respective coach. In the second stage, called the battles phase, coaches have to pair their team members to battle against each other directly by singing the same song together on a stage that looks like a battle ring. The coach chooses the winner of each battle, who goes into the first live round.
Within the live shows, the surviving acts from each team compete head-to-head, with the public vote determining who will advance to the next episode. Finally, between the remaining acts, the coach chooses one to advance. In the finale, the outcome is decided solely by public vote.
